0,cef9d203-1c30-3054-ae56-5c5b9dd8b4d3,VRSK,2023-07-27,Analysts Estimate Verisk Analytics (VRSK) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-verisk-analytics-vrsk-140230349.html,1690380150,STORY,['VRSK'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Verisk Analytics (VRSK) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance data provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.5%.Revenues are expected to be $653.13 million, down 12.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verisk?For Verisk, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.03%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verisk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verisk would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.29, delivering a surprise of +9.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verisk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, in the company's earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood warned that even with its leadership position in the nascent artificial intelligence (AI) industry, ""growth from our AI services will be gradual as Azure AI scales and our copilots reach general availability dates."" Additionally, the CFO said capital expenditures will ""increase sequentially each quarter through the year"" as the company scales to meet demand for its AI platform. MSFT stock fell 3.8%.Elsewhere, Texas Instruments reported higher-than-expected earnings and revenue for its second quarter, but gave disappointing guidance for its current quarter. Additionally, the company said it will continue forward with plans to build out manufacturing capacity even if it results in short-term changes in gross margin. ""Those are not irrelevant, of course,"" said Rafael Lizardi, chief financial officer of Texas Instruments, in the company's earnings call, ""but it's just the focus is on supporting revenue growth in the short-term, midterm and long-term."" The semiconductor stock slumped 5.4% today.Happily, not all of the day's earnings reports were as poorly received. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) jumped 5.8% on second-quarter earnings and revenue beats, while Dow stock Boeing (BA) rose 8.7% after reporting a narrower-than-expected Q2 loss.Story continuesFed resumes rate hikesWhile the raft of earnings reports commanded the market's attention for much of Wednesday's session, the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's July monetary policy meeting was the marquee event. As expected, the Fed lifted its benchmark rate by 25 basis points (0.25%) to a target range of 5.25% to 5.5% – the highest level since early 2001. In its statement, the Fed said it will remain data dependent in determining if more rate hikes are needed to bring inflation down to its 2% target.Along those lines, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in his subsequent press conference that the central bank will proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis to determine if future rate hikes are warranted. ""Between now and the September meeting, we get two more jobs reports and two more Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports,"" and the outcome of those reports will drive the Fed's decision-making process, Powell said. But regardless of whether it hikes rates again, the central bank intends ""to keep policy restrictive"" until it's ""confident inflation is coming down,"" the Fed chair added.This led to a nail-biter of a finish on Wall Street. While the S&amp;P 500 (-0.02% at 4,566) and the Nasdaq Composite (-0.1% at 14,127) closed modestly lower, the Dow eked out a 0.2% gain to 35,520. This marked the blue chip index's 13th straight advance and longest winning streak since 1987, according to Dow Jones Market Data.XPEV pops, boosts other EV stocksLost in the shuffle of a jam-packed earnings calendar and highly anticipated Fed meeting was news that German automaker Volkswagen (VWAGY, -0.5%) will invest $700 million in Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng (XPEV). The strategic partnership will include the joint development of two VW brand mid-size electric vehicles in the Chinese market. The news was enough to send XPEV stock up nearly 27% and generate a halo effect on other Chinese stocks in the EV industry, including Nio (NIO, +10.6%) and Li Auto (LI, +3.6%).We've mentioned before that the electric vehicle market is expected to grow by leaps and bounds over the next decade. As just one example, Fortune Business Insights projects a compound annual growth rate of 25.4% through 2028.As such, investors seeking out the best growth stocks would be wise to keep an eye on the electric vehicle space. Here, we take a look at some of the best EV stocks to capitalize on the expanding industry.Related ContentWhen is the Next CPI Report?What Is a Stock Buyback?Investing Jargon, Explained]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the semiconductor industry and the impact of AI on the sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI Boom.The Impact Of Artificial IntelligenceThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom has revolutionized almost every industry and sector in the market today, and the technology sector is perhaps the most heavily impacted by this frenzy. Semiconductor companies, in particular, are well-positioned to benefit from the AI boom, with many companies reporting higher sales and revenue forecasts directly correlated with the developments being seen in this space today. One example is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which forecasted its second-quarter revenue to come in at $11 billion, going above analyst estimates. Jensen Huang, the founder, and CEO of the company, noted that they will be increasing the supply of their family of products to meet the rising demand for them.On May 24, Needham &amp; Co.'s Global Semiconductor Analyst, Rajvindra Gill, was invited on CNBC to share his insights on NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-quarter earnings report. Here's what he had to say:""If you look at their guide for July, it's $11 billion. That's $4 billion over the Street. I thought it was a typo when I first looked at it - it's a massive guide up. Some of that might be higher pricing for their H-100.""According to Gill, the ""massive guide up"" may have to do a lot with the increasing demand for NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H-100, a demand he considers to be genuine and highly beneficial for the company. All in all, the company seems to have paved for itself a path for success in the rapidly transforming AI space at present and in the future. In an interview on CNBC Overtime this May, CEO Huang had the following to say on the future of AI:Story continues""We have reinvented computing for the first time since the IBM system 360 60 years ago. There's a trillion dollars worth of data center infrastructure based on the old method of doing computation. Now we have accelerated computing and we have the killer app for computing called generative AI.""According to Huang, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent partnership with ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is also ""a fantastic growth opportunity"" for both these companies in relation to their AI endeavors. The latter company is now offering the former access to immense amounts of data and ""the engine for transforming all of that data and domain expertise into generative AI models.""Considering the immense benefits to be gained from active involvement in the AI space, many semiconductor companies are throwing in their cap with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). For example, Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), mentioned in her June interview with CNBC that her company will be working on producing its own next-generation AI chip by the end of 2023. The next-generation GPU is aimed to pave the way for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to rival other semiconductor companies working on AI products today. Here are some comments from Su's interview:""Everybody's talking about AI. We've been working on this roadmap for many, many years. M1-300 is our newest generation chip and frankly, it's incredible. I mean, the amount of technology we have on this, a hundred and fifty-three billion transistors. Everybody's talking about ChatGPT and Large Language Models, and M1-300 is actually designed exactly for this use case.""Rising Demand For AI ChipsAccording to the interview, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) expects to sample its new chip by the third quarter and be in production by the end of 2023. Su's comments also signal that the company is focusing on making AI, particularly generative AI, its priority as it produces its new chips to meet the demand for AI chips. Here's what Su noted on this matter:""What we see is that there's a tremendous demand for GPUs in AI space, for both training and inference. We work with all of the largest cloud manufacturers as well as many of the largest enterprise guys. And so, you know, the key is 'let's get these products to market as fast as possible.'""According to Su, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for chips like these is $30 billion in 2023, which her company plans to grow to over $150 billion. This highlights how not just the two companies mentioned here but others like QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and more will also have their eyes set on the prize in this space. Consequently, several semiconductor companies today are aiming to produce semiconductors and chips for AI to leave their mark and satisfy their customers. As this continues, these companies may soon become some of the best AI stocks or AI chip makers in the market. We have thus compiled a list of the companies we think are the best ones to play the AI boom.10 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI BoomPhoto by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to get our list of the top semiconductors stocks in the market today and then ranked them using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

When investing in dividend stocks, seasoned investors pay attention to growth in their payouts over the years. Through this, they aim to benefit through a combination of growing income stream, capital appreciation, and protection against inflation. Returns of dividend growth stocks have surpassed those without any growth tracks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned RMB Capital’s research which revealed that dividend growers achieved a positive return of 9.62% from 1972 until December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79% during the same period.According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers exhibited lower volatility over the last 50 years. Due to this, many financial experts are now recommending the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental part of equity portfolios for their clients. The consistent growth and stability of dividends make them an attractive option for investors seeking reliable long-term returns. From 1973 to 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return to shareholders, whereas dividend payers and dividend non-payers returned 9.18% and -0.60%, respectively.

The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices is a catalyst. The growing need for faster connections, low latency and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots. The democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry players. These factors have bolstered the demand for radio-frequency semiconductor solutions provided by industry players like Skyworks Solutions SWKS and Qorvo QRVO. Nevertheless, rise in commodity prices, raging inflation, growing interest rates and global macroeconomic uncertainties remain headwinds for industry participants.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers, and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in congested RF spectrum.

Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.4 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF IndustryAccelerated 5G Deployment is a Tailwind: The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications hold promise for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which are expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. Further, the growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects.

CasperThanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter, then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing playing out in the macro economy and the implications for our outlook.In the second quarter, our revenue was $10.69 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion, and we delivered adjusted EPS of $5.15 per share. As you saw in our press release, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the quarter. Economic activity in China slowed. And across the economy more broadly, businesses became more cautious in their spend. This impacted our Q2 results and informed a more moderated view for the full year. We're taking appropriate actions to successfully navigate these conditions.As a reminder, when we set out our guidance at the beginning of the year, we assumed core market growth would be in the normal range of 4% to 6% for 2023. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment at this point, we think it is best to assume that these conditions will persist for the remainder of the year, and our current assumption is that core market growth will be in the 0% to 2% range this year.We're increasing our commercial intensity to help our customers through this environment and capture even more opportunities. We're also leveraging the PPI Business System to appropriately manage our costs. Given these changes, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. I'll cover some of the key points around the guidance, and Stephen will outline our underlying assumptions later in the call.For 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44.0 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $22.28 to $22.72. As you know, during periods of change, we have a very clear set of guiding principles on how we manage the company. These principles have three elements. First, everything we do starts with our customers and ensuring that we're enabling their success. Second, we inspire our colleagues to bring their best every day to fulfill our mission. And third, we hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard to deliver differentiated short-term performance, all while capitalizing on dynamic times to enhance our long-term competitive position, creating an even brighter future for our company.To enable the differentiated short- and long-term performance in this environment, we're leveraging our PPI Business System to deliver $450 million of additional cost actions in 2023. That's in addition to what was embedded in our previous guidance. We're ramping up our commercial intensity to drive our share gain momentum, and we continue to invest in our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We're uniquely positioned to help them navigate their own challenges in this environment.When I think about our proven ability to navigate market dynamics combined with the long-term market growth drivers for the life sciences industry, I'm incredibly confident for the future. As I look ahead, there is a clear need for new medicines, and the scientific advances in life sciences are leading to exciting and innovative therapies, which will make a profound positive impact on well-being and be one of the drivers creating the very strong and durable tailwind in our industry.Let me now turn to our quarterly performance and provide you with an update on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech. Growth was flat for the second quarter. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue runoff performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a 5-point headwind within this market. From a segment perspective, that revenue runoff is essentially all in our Life Science Solutions segment, largely in our biosciences business related to nucleotides and enzymes and, to a lesser extent, in bioproduction. The strongest growth in pharma and biotech end market this quarter was in our pharma services and clinical research businesses.In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as our research and safety market channel.In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for the quarter. The strongest growth in this end market was in our Analytical Instruments businesses.And finally, in diagnostics and health care, revenue in Q2 was approximately 20% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter, driven by our microbiology, immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic businesses.Let me now turn to our growth strategy. We really made terrific progress in Q2 in this regard. Our growth strategy consists of three pillars: high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers and our unparalleled commercial engine.Starting with the first pillar, innovation. We had a really spectacular quarter. We launched high-impact new products that are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to bring new ground in their important work. We had a great showing at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry conference, where we featured the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap mass spectrometer, which is the most significant advancement in mass spectrometry in 15 years. The Orbitrap Astral combines speed, high sensitivity and deep proteome coverage to enable researchers to uncover proteins that previously evaded detection. This will enable breakthroughs that could lead to the development of new targeted therapies for a range of diseases, from cardiovascular disease to cancer. We've already started to deliver the Astral to our customers, and we're very pleased with the strong bookings performance to date.In our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6, scanning transmission electron microscope, the latest innovation in our leading line of instruments designed for the semiconductor industry. This fully automated system enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high-quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to accelerate development.In our biosciences business, we introduced the Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium Kit. It accelerates development of novel cancer therapies. This kit supports the culture of tumor cells derived from individual patients providing a better disease model for research and drug development that could potentially improve clinical trial success and help bring drug candidates to market faster and more cost effectively.And in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the first and only immunoassay to help doctors stratify a mother's risk of developing preeclampsia, a serious complication that can develop in pregnancy in the postpartum period, endangering both mother and baby. We received breakthrough designation and FDA clearance for assessing a patient's risk of developing severe preeclampsia, enabling doctors to better manage care.These are just a few examples of the exciting innovation going on across our company, which will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth.The second pillar of our growth strategy is the trusted partner status that we have built with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry-leading products, services and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. For example, in our pharma services business, we added an early development hub at our site in Bourgoin, France, enabling early development in addition to commercial manufacturing.The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unparalleled commercial engine. We have a meaningful commercial advantage due to the deep engagement that we're able to have with our customers across the globe. A great example of our progress here is further strengthening our commercial capabilities with the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan. It features a customer application development lab to showcase our industry-leading products, services and expertise.We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&amp;A and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we completed a small bolt-on acquisition of MarqMetrix, a developer of Raman-based spectroscopy solutions for in-line process analytics. This technology expands our capabilities to help our customers make precise and accurate measurements throughout their manufacturing processes in a wide range of applications, including biopharma. This business is a nice complement to our Analytical Instruments business.Let me give you a quick update on the binding site acquisition, which we closed at the beginning of the year. Our protein diagnostics business has delivered outstanding growth and the integration is going incredibly well. Our team is progressing the innovation pipeline to advance the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and immune disorders.And just after the close of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. Real-world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high-growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers as well as regulating bodies are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in the post-approval setting.CorEvitas will further strengthen our capabilities to serve our pharma and biotech customers. It's an excellent strategic fit for our company and highly complementary to our clinical research business. There is strong market demand for real-world evidence, which improves decision-making and reduces the time and costs associated with drug development. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and I'm very excited about what this will mean for our customers and the patients they serve. Financially, we expect the business to deliver low double-digit growth and be accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.03 in 2024. So overall, strong progress in the second quarter for capital deployment.During the quarter, we advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities, including launching a partnership with Pfizer to increase local access to next-generation sequencing-based testing for lung and breast cancer patients in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. These are areas where advanced genomic testing has previously been limited or unavailable. Access to local NGS testing can help to provide faster analysis of associated genes, empowering health care providers to select the right therapy for that individual patient.Through the partnership, we will work with local labs using our NGS technology to ensure they meet industry standards for NGS testing for breast and lung cancer. Pfizer will work to enable affordable patient access and to raise health care provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced NGS testing. Together, we'll continue to evaluate additional geographic opportunities and to expand testing for other types of cancer. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success, but also by creating a better -- a great work environment for our colleagues and making a positive impact for society.So to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter. While the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging, our team continues to leverage our PPI Business System to deliver strong productivity. We're focused on driving market share gains, and at the same time, we're advancing our proven growth strategy to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. And the attractive long-term outlook for the life sciences industry and Thermo Fisher is unchanged. We're incredibly well positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities and exit this period an even stronger industry leader with a very bright future.With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?Stephen WilliamsonThanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just outlined, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the second quarter. We're leveraging our PPI Business System to effectively manage these conditions.In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included just over 2% core organic revenue growth, and we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS. Revenue in the quarter was $300 million lower than we had incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, $280 million of this was related to the core business and $20 million related to testing. Approximately 1/3 of the change in core revenue was driven by lower economic activity in China, and the remainder was driven by more cautious spending across our customer base globally, particularly in biotech. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.28 lower than we incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, $0.07 of this was driven by FX and $0.21 by the lower revenue.Given the lower core revenue both in the quarter and assumed in our full year outlook, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. In Q2, this enabled us to offset $75 million of the profit impact of the lower-than-expected revenue. This highlights that we're actively managing the business.Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS in Q2. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.51. On the top line, reported revenue was 3 percentage points lower year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from foreign exchange. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was just over 2 percentage points. For context, core organic revenue growth includes the runoff in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue. Without that runoff impact, growth would have been 5% in the quarter.Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America declined mid-single digits. Europe grew in the low-single digits, and Asia Pacific declined in the mid-single digits with China declining in the low teens.With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, 150 basis points lower than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and achieved strong price realization. This was more than offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments and FX.Given the change in the macro environment, we're using the PPI Business System to drive significantly more productivity this year than initially planned. We've initiated $450 million of additional cost actions. And as I mentioned earlier, we already began to see this benefit in Q2. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41%, 220 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for adjusted operating margin.Moving on to the details of the P&amp;L. Adjusted SG&amp;A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q2 last year. Total R&amp;D expense was $345 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&amp;D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.1% in the quarter.Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $148 million, which is $36 million higher than Q2 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. This was 300 basis points lower than Q2 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q2, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution.Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $1.5 billion after investing $730 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes and returned $135 million of capital through dividends.Shortly after the quarter end, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire CorEvitas for approximately $900 million. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and $34 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9x on a net debt basis.Concluding my comments on our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 11.9%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation.Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 25% and organic revenue was also 25% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year ago quarter and to a lesser extent, the macro factors that I described earlier. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 38% and adjusted operating margin was 33.2%, down 710 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix.In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2 and organic growth was 10%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 24.7%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume mix, and that was partially offset by strategic investments and FX.Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2, revenue increased 1% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our microbiology immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter.Q2 adjusted operating income increased 22% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which is 460 basis points higher than Q2 2022. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and favorable business mix, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments.And finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 5% and organic growth was also 5%. During Q2, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services and clinical research businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 160 basis points higher than Q2 2022. We delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, partially offset by FX and strategic investments.Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're revising our full year 2023 guidance to reflect both the more challenging macroeconomic environment and the offsetting actions that we're taking to navigate these conditions. Revenue for 2023 is now expected to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44 billion, with core organic revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $22.28 and $22.72. For modeling purposes, our current estimates are where we're likely to end up for the year within that range is $43.5 billion of revenue, rounding up to 3% core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $22.36.Let me provide you some additional details behind the change in guidance, starting with revenue. Our revised guidance reflects a change in the assumption for core organic revenue growth from 7% to a range of 2% to 4%, and it also assumes $100 million lower testing revenue. Our core organic revenue change is driven by 2 factors: a reduction in the assumed level of economic activity in China and an assumption that the more cautious spending that we saw across our customer base in Q2 will continue throughout the remainder of the year.In relation to China, at the beginning of the year, we saw positive momentum in the Chinese economy. We had previously assumed that this momentum would continue through the rest of the year. However, as the second quarter progressed, economic activity in China significantly slowed, resulting in less customer activity in the quarter. We think it's appropriate to assume that this condition remains in place for the remainder of the year.With regards to customer spending patterns more broadly, in Q2, customers in our end markets began the year with somewhat cautious spending. And this is something that was not confined to our end markets, companies across most business segments were cautious with their spending given the uncertain macro conditions. This dynamic became more challenging in Q2. We previously assumed that this would lessen an impact as the year progressed, and we now think it's appropriate to assume that the cautious spending will continue through the remainder of the year.With strong commercial execution from our team, we expect to successfully navigate these macro dynamics and deliver 2% to 4% core organic revenue growth for the year. And for context, as Marc mentioned, with the changes in the macro, we're now assuming core market growth for our industry to be in the range of 0% to 2% for 2023, a reduction of approximately 4 percentage points versus the 4% to 6% assumed previously for market growth.When I think about the range of outcomes for the full year, core organic revenue growth, the largest swing factor, is the extent of the budget flush at the end of the year. Should that be weaker than normal, then core organic revenue growth would round down to 2%. And if stronger, it could round up to 4% for the year. And if China gets traction stimulating the economy, then that could also be an upside later in the year.So moving on now to profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. We put in place $450 million of additional cost actions to limit the impact of the expected lower revenue on the P&amp;L. This demonstrates our active management of the business. As a result, the high profitability pull-through on the lower revenue is expected to be reduced to 35% in terms of how it flows through to the bottom line. And factoring in this and the updated view of FX, we now expect our adjusted operating income margin to be in the range of 23.2% to 23.4% for the year.So let me provide some more additional details on the updated 2023 guidance. We're assuming that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. This is $100 million lower than our prior guidance. And through the half year point, we delivered $225 million of testing revenue. Within the core, we continue to expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3 percentage point impact on core organic revenue growth. Through the half-year point, we delivered $365 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue.Moving on to FX. We continue to assume that FX will be a year-over-year tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. And then in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a headwind of $0.11, which is $0.05 higher than our previous guidance.The Binding Site acquisition is performing well, and we now assume it will contribute approximately $260 million to our reported revenue growth for the year and $0.09 to adjusted EPS. Below the line, we continue to expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. The adjusted tax rate assumption for the year has improved to 10% versus our prior guidance of 10.8%, driven by our tax planning initiative. We're now expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect that free cash flow will be $6.9 billion for the year.In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We continue to assume that full year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares, and that will return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. We've not included any operational benefit in 2023 for the acquisition of CorEvitas. Before we get more clarity on the actual close date for that acquisition, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2023.So to conclude, we recognize that the change in guidance is significant. We think it's appropriate given the change in the macro environment. And as we said at our Investor Day, should market growth be lower than normal, we will leverage the PPI Business System and step up productivity, and that's what we've done. We're well positioned to navigate the near-term environment. And while the near-term environment may be more challenging, the long-term fundamentals supporting the growth of our end markets remains unchanged, as does the strength of our position to serve them.Now let me turn the call back over to Raf.Rafael TejadaThank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs.Matthew Carlisle SykesMaybe just starting on the guidance, just given the significant change relative to what you talked about at the Investor Day a few months ago. Could you maybe help us a little bit with where some of the biggest deltas in terms of your expectations relative to that time of the Investor Day? And today, in terms of either end market or revenue segment and specifically within China, were there certain categories or revenue segments or end markets where the weakness is more pronounced? I just kind of wanted to get a little more color on the delta and expectations from the Investor Day to today.Marc N. CasperYes. So Matt, thanks for the question. In terms of the guidance change, the way that I think about it, let's start from the beginning of the year. I think it's the easiest place to start and we can talk about the Investor Day, right? So in terms of the market growth and the conditions there, right, our -- what we're seeing is that China really slowed quite meaningfully in Q2, right? And that's actually somewhat surprising, given the first quarter really started to rebound off of the Zero COVID policies and there was government stimulus, and all of a sudden, Q2 really slowed down significantly.And when I think about that -- and then we're assuming that for the full year, right, in terms that it's going to continue. We've seen customer caution. I mean, I think every business when I say -- this is about life science tools and diagnostics. Businesses have been cautious this year on spend, and it certainly manifested itself more meaningfully in Q2, particularly in biotech. And so when I think about it, about a point of our change in the growth outlook comes from China. About 3 points of it comes from customer caution. And within it, bioproduction is about 1 point or 1/3 of the customer caution, passed back 2/3 across the rest of the business.Versus sort of what the Analyst Day and sort of the view in May, we saw China certainly soft throughout the quarter. And in our business, the final month of a quarter is actually quite meaningful across all of our businesses. So while we certainly saw some customer caution in the beginning of the second quarter, June saw no bounce at all, right? So it's kind of flat through the quarter. So therefore, we just didn't see that view, which is why we've adjusted the outlook at this point in time.Matthew Carlisle SykesGreat. That's very helpful color. And then just for my follow-up, just on the AI segment and instruments. Could you maybe just give us the visibility you might have into sort of the back half of this year? Talk about sort of what the backlog looks like, order growth and how you're feeling about sort of the moderation in instrument growth in the back half of this year that you talked about earlier this year.Marc N. CasperYes, Matt, thanks for the question. So when I think about instruments, we obviously entered the year with a strong backlog and we entered the quarter with a strong backlog, and the 10% growth is a very strong performance. Orders were definitely softer than we expected in Q2, primarily driven by China, which is a large component of the business there. And therefore, I would say we would expect that the growth rate would become more muted as the year unfolds in the Analytical Instruments business as we continue to work on the backlog.OperatorOur next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel.Daniel Anthony AriasStephen, on the PPI commentary and just being able to leverage that, can you expand on that a little bit? I mean should we take that to mean just sort of pressing harder on being lean in areas where you've done that in the past? Or is that more pulling some levers that haven't been fully pulled, so to speak? And then relatedly, the EPS guide only came in about 5% or so at the midpoint. So how do we think about mix as a factor there? And how much room do you think that's left to you given the uncertainty that you're looking at in the back half?Stephen WilliamsonYes. So Dan, I'll explain on the PPI side, and then I'll get on to the kind of the EPS view. So on PPI, what we do -- it's how we run the company. So this is about -- the first thing you do when you think about economic conditions being different and activity levels being different with our customers is prioritization in terms of what we're working on and deprioritize areas, which may be less important, push things out as appropriately and then now make sure that we're investing in the right areas that we should be investing in and not titrating back any spending where that really matters. So it's about prioritizing where we're spending our time and what we're working on. And part of that then is then reduction in discretionary spending, reduction in activity levels in certain areas, and these PPIs be able to help us do that and put that into operation.We use the company scale in terms of the levers on sourcing, particularly in indirect, so you can lean on those levers when economic conditions aren't as strong, and that's definitely a way of getting some of the benefit. And then when we think about the expected slightly lower volumes and we're optimizing our manufacturing operations appropriately and generally across our businesses, we're appropriately reducing headcount where that makes sense across the business. And so all of that wraps up into $450 million of benefit this year, and those actions have pretty much all be in action right now in terms of -- there's nothing significant to comment more. We've taken the appropriate actions given the environment that we see.Then in terms of the back half of the year, so was your question around the phasing of EPS or the range of EPS? Could you just clarify?Daniel Anthony AriasI guess it was a little bit of both. I mean organic growth is going from high singles to potentially low singles, and the EPS only actually came in a pretty modest amount. So I was just wondering how much room you think you've given yourself, given your PPI comments, whether your -- I guess the answer is you're comfortable with it. But how comfortable actually are you given the range of outcomes in the back half?Stephen WilliamsonYes. So we provided a range of outcomes, and we talked about what the market conditions could be. And when we think about what the pull-through would be on the revenue and that range of outcomes, plus the activities we're working on the cost side, I think that's an appropriate range for EPS.And then the phasing first half, second half, clearly, a higher adjusted operating income margin in the second half of the year, and that's really largely driven by the impact of the cost actions. So of the $450 million, $75 million impacted the first half. And you'll have $335 million of benefit in the second half. And the revenue is a little bit more weighted and look at the year as a whole to the second half versus the first half. That's the other piece that drives the profitability and EPS.OperatorOur next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.Vijay Muniyappa KumarMarc, maybe one on -- the assumptions are on the guide change. When you look at the quarter, maybe can you talk about how things progress? I think China was down low teens. Overall, organic -- underlying organic was 2%. The things worsened throughout the quarter, because I think the implied guidance for the back half is low singles, 2%-ish at the midpoint. So we're just wondering if the exit rate was around 2%-ish or is the back half assuming some improvement from the exit rate levels of 2Q?Marc N. CasperYes. So Vijay, in terms of the phasing of the quarter, I think really what was different was June saw none of the normal quarter-end pattern. So it was very similar to April and May. That -- in my many years of doing this, that's unusual, actually, where the last month isn't a big step-up in activity. That's just the sort of the pattern of the industry a bit.So our assumption for the year is effectively that the market conditions that we saw in Q2 -- in aggregate for Q2 continues to play out for the balance of the year. And you have all sorts of different comparisons within the different businesses versus the prior year and so forth. But we felt that the 0% to 2% market growth and for us, for the full year, the 2% to 4% core growth would be an appropriate performance.I think maybe the best color that I can give you is sort of how we think about it, right? Our best view on what happened in the market is informed by looking at all of the competitors, peers that reported in Q1. Obviously, that goes well into May. All of our internal data about what's going on in the market, our extensive dialogue with customers and the few companies that reported so far, right? So that informs the 0% to 2%. The way we think about this and the standard is -- it's our job to gain market share. We put in 2 points of growth faster than that assumption. We're going to hold ourselves to that standard, meaning if we're too conservative on the market outlook, then we will have higher expectations of what good looks like in terms of the year. But that's our best view.When you look at the script in the comments that Stephen and I made, we made no comments about share gain in Q2 because when you deliver 2% growth, we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. At least looking at the first few companies that have reported, it appears that our performance is actually quite good and that we're growing faster. There's a lot of companies yet to report, but it actually looks like, on a relative basis, we actually had a solid quarter of growth. So hopefully, that gives you some context of where things are, but we're going to keep studying it and make sure we got a good handle on our performance. And when we end '23, that we will be proud that we navigated the environment extremely well, deliver differentiated performance and set the company up for long-term success.Vijay Muniyappa KumarThat's extremely helpful color, Marc. And maybe one follow-up here. The updated guidance, is it assuming China to remain declined for the rest of the year? And what was PPI's growth in the quarter?Stephen WilliamsonVijay, the decline will lessen on a reported basis because of the run-up in testing and actually therapies a little bit there in terms of the support of the pandemic that we did in the back half of the year last year. So we're assuming basically the same market conditions, not just China, but for the rest of the world as well as we saw in Q2 for the remainder of the year.Marc N. CasperClinical research, double-digit growth.OperatorOur next question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen.Daniel Gregory BrennanGreat. Marc, Jets are hoping out and Rogers can navigate through a difficult schedule, certainly hope and expect you'll navigate Thermo through these more difficult macro times here. Maybe just the first one, would love to get more color on China. Could you just walk us through just more color across your major customer segments, kind of unpack, kind of how the quarter played out from that perspective? And then specifically, I would also love to hear color on bioproduction in China.Marc N. CasperYes. So in terms of China, when I think about it, we had a decline on an organic basis a little over 10%. Core was about flat in terms of it, and I'm just trying to give some flavor. So you obviously have the COVID testing. What we saw in China -- and it was very different than what our team expected, what we expected. And if I think about that, that's unusual comment coming from us. Actually, our leadership team from China came to the U.S. I had the opportunity to sit down and chat with them of what are they seeing. So -- and I'm heading over to China in a few weeks as well for a week. So it's an important market. It really does feel like it is broad economic based. And so we saw that across our different businesses, not limited to one. Clearly, bioproduction was soft in China. So consistent with some of the other comments that you've heard from others. But we saw the slowdown really cut across the portfolio, if you will, and it seems to be economic activity.We always assume, hey, are we doing something wrong? Are we losing share? All of those things, because I think that's sort of the PPI discipline, which is fact-based, hold yourself accountable to a high standard. At least on what we're seeing, it just feels like customers got extraordinarily cautious in China, activity slowed and it showed up across the portfolio. And while I haven't had a moment to distract myself on some fun activities, I look forward to, at some point, some football and seeing if the Jets actually make an improvement.Stephen WilliamsonThanks. Listen, Dan, I can't comment on the Jets. But when I think about China, it is way broader than life science tools. This is a Chinese economy. They're clearly having problems getting that economy back up and running post-COVID, and they have a history of being able to do that. So -- but we're not counting on that for the remainder of the year as a way to frame it from a wider economic viewpoint. Thanks, Dan.Daniel Gregory BrennanGreat. And then maybe just on the end market, 4% to 6%, which you took down to 0% to 2% right now under your planning for 2023. Kind of from what you see today, is that 0% to 2% the best starting point as we think about modeling out Thermo's top line for 2024?Marc N. CasperDo you want to talk a little bit about, Stephen?Stephen WilliamsonYes. So just broadly on 2024, when I think about what you need to do to model the company going forward, there's two factors. One is the jumping off point for the 2023 margins and then what's the macro conditions assumption you used for 2024. So obviously, on the macro, we're assuming that the near-term conditions stay the same throughout the remainder of the year. You will need to make your own assumption around what that market growth is for next year. We'll have more clarity on that when we get towards the end of this year and know what the macro conditions are like. So it's not macro within our industry, it's the macro in terms of the overall economic situation across the globe. So we'll have a clearer view on that towards the end of this year. As Marc said earlier, we'll hold ourselves to the standard of delivering a couple of points higher than what the market growth is when we think about that. So as you leave in what assumption you have, I think the assumption is we'll be driving a couple of points of share gain above that.And then from a margin standpoint, a normal assumption for the year would be start with 50 basis points of expansion on top of what we just ended the year. And then when you think about my guide for this year, it will be some small benefit of the carryover of the cost actions into 2023 as well. So that will help you think about the margin profile for '24 at this point and provide you a more refined view on that when we give the guidance for '24 in more detail.OperatorOur next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.Derik De BruinSo Dan sort of asked some of the questions I wanted to talk to you about on '24. I guess, Marc, what's your view that we're not entering a more prolonged downturn in the life sciences tools market? And I'm just sort of thinking about this from a historical perspective when we've sort of seen some resets in the market, and it's taken a while for this to sort of like wash through the system. So it's like what's your confidence that we're not in a situation where we've got a couple -- we've got a period where the growth is going to be sort of back in that lower range?Marc N. CasperYes. So Derik, it's a great question. So if I step back from the crystal ball for which moment and say what's the drivers here, this is an unbelievable industry with incredible tailwinds. And even since the Analyst Day, if you look about the progress on approved medicines that are going on and the cycle that, that creates of more funding to fuel the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, it's extraordinarily encouraging for the long term, right?So when I think about 4% to 6% market growth for the long term, as bullish as ever, right, in terms of that. When I think about the dynamics, most of what is going on is around the macroeconomic environment, not the life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, right, in terms of caution in the economy, credit availability, all of that cycle, higher interest rates and, therefore, less funding going into higher growth business. All of that dynamic is a macro. Within our own industry, you clearly have the pandemic unwind, right, that's shaking out. And as you look at the industry's numbers, and even if you look at our numbers, the pandemic-related activity will be relatively modest this year. So most of that will have washed out in the industry this year.So when I think about '24, as Stephen said, it's really going to be what's the macro, not the life sciences tools macro that I think is the big driver, because the science can be exquisite. I mean great things going on in pharma biotech. There'll be great new discoveries. All of that will attract funding. It's just a question of, is this a kind of a stabilization year for the economy and then it balances? That's the bull case. Or is this a more prolonged period? And then that obviously is more of the bearish case on sort of what the macro is. And while we won't have a perfect crystal ball as we get into our guidance in '24, we'll have a much better sense of what the conditions we are navigating. Hopefully, that's helpful.Derik De BruinYes, it is. It is. So just a follow-up on this is, like how much of the pharma and biotech slowdown is just this digestion of the excess COVID spending? And clearly, there was frothy biotech markets and people worry about supply chain. So there was -- a lot of money that went into the system is we call debtors. How much is this just digesting that extra spend versus are you seeing new concerns? Are these customers seeing new concerns of a regulatory environment, drug pricing, patent expirations? Are you seeing any signs of slowing clinical trial activity or higher cancellations rates? Just some sort of thought on what's just a hangover period from COVID versus new trepidation in the space.Marc N. CasperSure. So Derik, the way I would think about it is, if you go back to the beginning of the year and sort of how we talked about our guidance, pharma and biotech, right, as a company, as a reminder, our core organic growth was 14% in 2022. Within that, vaccines and therapies were essentially flat. So actually, the -- whatever the stripping that out, we actually grew faster than that. Pharma biotech, incredibly strong in 2022.Our view was, while the market would be a good end market in 2023, but given the comparisons, it would moderate meaningfully. That's not a negative comment, it's just such an oversized growth. And our very strong growth in the prior year period, we knew that growth would slow. And when you look at the Q2 results, you're flat and 5 points of headwind, which actually performed literally exactly as we had forecasted for the quarter. So kind of 5% growth, excluding the sort of vaccine and therapy runoff this year. That gives you a sense of what the sort of base activity is in that market, which actually is reasonable. It's slower than some other periods. But given the comparison, it actually is a reasonable view.In terms of the color and all of those things, pharma's doing fine, right, I mean in terms of what's happening there. And it's really biotech -- every quarter that funding has been a little bit more challenged or not as strong as the past, companies get more conservative because they think about what's their runway on spending, and that really picked up in terms of the headwinds in Q2 against an incredibly difficult comparison in the prior year period.The final point I would make here is that there are some green shoots starting to happen in biotech, right, in terms of new company formation, some of the funding. Actually, Q2 started to show some signs of positivity. That obviously takes a while to flow through the numbers. But actually, that's an encouraging data point as well. Hopefully, that level of context gives you somehow to think about it.OperatorOur next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan.Rachel Marie Vatnsdal OlsonPerfect. So I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on that guidance kind of how you guys are bucketing where the cut was really coming from. So you said that of the 400 basis points, 1 point was really from China, 3 points were around customer spending with 1 of that coming from bioproduction. So can you just give us a bit more color on where the remaining 2 points and weaker customer spend is happening? It sounds like PPD growth was strong. So where else are you seeing weakness in the portfolio? And then also from an end market perspective, is this really all just weakness in pharma biotech or is there some additional weakness in industrial, for example?Marc N. CasperYes. So when I think about customer caution, sort of a macroeconomic view, you see that across all types of customers. So it's not limited to one segment. It's more pronounced than biotech, but we saw it in some industrial customers and certainly, we saw it in some of the other customers that we serve, academic and government so forth. So it's not limited to one view.In terms of the growth where the impact and the change of growth is in the other segments, clearly, with -- our view is that the instruments business will slow in the second half of the year. So that's probably one of the changes. And then some of the run rate activity that you would see in things like bioscience reagents or customer channels, which actually those are great businesses, we think customers will be a little bit more muted in spending. So it's really not pinned to one area, but just spread across the portfolio, probably with instruments feeling most of the impact.Rafael TejadaOperator, we're ready for -- we'll take one last question.OperatorOur next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.Jack MeehanI wanted to ask about M&amp;A. These dynamic times, historically, have a way of creating new opportunities. There's been a few larger assets talked about in the press. Just would love to get your thoughts. Do you expect to be active if something materialized?Marc N. CasperYes. Jack, thanks for the question. So in terms of capital deployment and M&amp;A, we've been active on return of capital, both through the increase in the dividend and the share buybacks earlier in the year. We've also been active on M&amp;A with closing the Binding Site to start the year. We're excited about CorEvitas. And we have a lot of firepower, and we're very active, right?I do agree with your sentiment that, in these periods, there are opportunities. So we're actively looking at a number of things. And we're only going to do transactions that fit our criteria, which, ultimately, is going to strengthen our offering from a customer perspective. It's going to clearly add shareholder value in terms of the returns that we generate from the transaction. So you'll see us be active. And whether that happens in terms of the second half of the year or into '24, we're certainly busy is the way we think about it.Jack MeehanGreat. And I have one follow-up on Pharma Services. It sounds like that business grew faster than PPD this quarter. Can you talk about how the demand profile is holding up there? And I need to ask about the tornado that hit Rocky Mount. Does that have any material impact on the market as you see it?Marc N. CasperYes. So Pharma Services, really strong performance in terms of growth. And the way you'd characterize it as accurate. So very strong growth in that business. When I think about new wins and some of the things that we're securing for the future, the team is doing a nice job of building out a strong backlog for the future. So that business is in a good spot.When I think about the tornado that hit in North Carolina, the good news is that nobody was injured, at least in our discussions with the customer. They're assessing the issues from a market perspective. And we stand ready to help our customers as we do in any situation, and we never view that as a business opportunity. We always view it as we have very material relationships with our customers. And our colleagues are there to support them, and we will support in any way that is helpful as they work through the natural disaster.So thank you, Jack, for the question. And thanks, everyone, for the questions today. Let me wrap up with -- thanks for joining us. We're very well positioned to deliver and continue to deliver differentiated performance, which we'll do. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. Thanks, everyone.OperatorThat concludes today's conference call.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $45.24 billion.The adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $22.28-$22.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $23.60 billion.Our TakeThermo Fisher exited the second quarter of 2023 with lower-than-expected results. The challenging macroeconomic environment and a slowdown in economic activity in China and across the world hampered revenues. The year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions is disappointing. The contraction of margins, due to escalating costs and expenses, does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is a concern. On a positive note, the robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments is promising. During the first quarter, strong execution of proven growth strategy, launching a range of high-impact, innovative new products aided the company’s growth.

24,e32d1d8d-222b-393e-a950-1cb0690f21b9,CF,2023-07-27,CF Industries (CF) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-cf-report-q2-152700755.html,1690385220,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF is set to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2, after the closing bell.CF Industries beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters while missing it once. The company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 1%, on average. CF’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect the impacts of softer nitrogen prices.Shares of CF Industries have decreased 10.3% in the past year compared with a 21.6% decline of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Do the Estimates Indicate?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CF Industries' second-quarter total sales is currently pegged at $1,855 million, which indicates a 45.3% decline year over year.Our estimate for total sales in the Ammonia segment is currently pegged at $518.5 million, indicating a 53.5% decline on a year-over-year basis. The same for the Granular Urea segment is $460.2 million, which suggests a decrease of 44.8% year over year.Our estimate for sales of the Urea Ammonium Nitrate Solution segment is currently pegged at $606.9 million, which suggests a decline of 37.8% year over year.Our estimate for total sales of the Ammonium Nitrate segment is currently pegged at $146.8 million, which indicates a decline of 42% year over year.Factors at Play in Q2CF Industries is expected to have benefited from increasing global demand for nitrogen fertilizers in the second quarter, driven by agricultural and industrial demand. Demand for nitrogen is likely to have remained healthy in the quarter on the back of higher crop commodity prices, high levels of corn planted acres and favorable farm economics. Additionally, lower natural gas prices are expected to have led to a decline in the company's cost of sales.However, higher global supply availability driven by improved global operating rates due to lower global energy costs has resulted in a decline in prices. Lower average selling prices weighed on CF's top line in the first quarter. The weak pricing environment is expected to have continued in the second quarter. Lower pricing is expected to have hurt the company’s sales and margins.Story continuesOur estimate for second-quarter average selling price per ton for the Ammonia segment is pegged at $562, reflecting a 47.8% year-over-year decline. We also expect average selling price per ton for the Granular Urea unit to be $410, indicating a 41.8% year-over-year decline. The same for the UAN segment is pegged at $363, indicating a 39.5% year-over-year decrease. Our estimate for average selling price per ton for the AN unit stands at $399, reflecting a 31.2% year-over-year decline.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

25,d0f891eb-165c-3774-8537-80e5acb98a3a,CF,2023-07-27,Analysts Estimate CF Industries (CF) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-cf-industries-cf-140234202.html,1690380154,STORY,"['CF', 'MOS']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when CF Industries (CF) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -64.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.86 billion, down 45.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.59% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF?For CF, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CF will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CF would post earnings of $2.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.85, delivering a surprise of +8.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CF doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Fertilizers industry, Mosaic (MOS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.13 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -69%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.22 billion, down 40.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Mosaic has been revised 14.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -6.84%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mosaic will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also joining us for the Q&amp;A portion of the call are Larry Wood, our Group President of TAVR and Surgical Structural Heart; and Daveen Chopra, our global leader of TMTT. Katie Szyman, our global leader of Critical Care is out of town today, but she'll be with us on future earnings calls. Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2023 financial results. During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&amp;A. Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates, assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release, our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms constant currency and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are available in today's press release. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard for his comments. Bernard?Story continuesBernard J. ZovighianThanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. I am pleased to share with you the work that our team did to help more patients than even before with our life-saving therapies. Today, I'm going to talk about the strong second quarter performance across product groups, our progress in advancing our patient-focused innovation strategy and our confidence in the outlook for Edwards in the years ahead. In the second quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth driven by increased adoption of our innovative therapies. Total sales of $1.53 billion grew 12% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than our expectation. We experienced broad-based growth across Edwards portfolio. Given improving health care staffing and our first half performance, we continue to expect strong results in 2023. As a result, we have lifted our full year 2023 sales and EPS guidance. Longer term, we are confident in our focused and differentiated strategy given heart valve failure is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. We remain committed to increasing awareness and providing innovative life-saving therapies, so even more patients can benefit. Now I will provide an overview of second quarter sales performance by product group. In TAVR, we continue to see strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform with sales of $992 million, up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were comparable. Local selling prices were stable. In the U.S., our second quarter TAVR sales were aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. We estimate that total procedure growth was in line with our sales growth. Additionally, we will be restarting enrollment this quarter in our pivotal trial alliance designed to study of next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. Outside of the U.S., we had positive constant currency sales growth from all regions. In Europe, Edwards sales growth were driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. Our sales in Japan grew sequentially and year-over-year on a constant currency basis, although our results continued to be impacted by lower-than-expected market growth and competitive trialing in the first half of this year. As a result, we estimate overall OUS TAVR procedure growth in Q2 was slightly higher than Edward's OUS TAVR growth. During the quarter, at the EuroPCR medical congress data on the benchmark study we are presented on 2,400 patients treated with SAPIEN valves across 28 European centers. It was very encouraging to note that patients experienced a 33% reduction in the median hospital length of stay while maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes. This study shows that by implementing best practices with the SAPIEN platform, centers can be more efficient without compromising patient outcomes. Turning to TMTT. We remain focused on 3 key value drivers to unlock this opportunity, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcome. TMTT's second quarter global sales of $48 million increased nearly 70% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Growth was driven by continued strong overall procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION platform and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. We continue to higher trialing and grow the field team to deliver on our high-touch model as we expand. In mitral, enrollment is going -- is ongoing in the Class IIF pivotal trial for functional mitral patients. We are also pleased with the enrollment in the SAPIEN pivotal trial for the SAPIEN M3 mitral valve replacement and remain on track to complete enrollment around the end of this year. In tricuspid, the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues and rolling well. With the completion of TRISCEND II enrollment, continued access for EVOQUE allows U.S. centers to continue to offer this therapy for tricuspid patients. We remain on track for a European approval by the end of 2023 and U.S. approval around the end of 2024. In Surgical, second quarter sales of $256 million increased 13% on a constant currency basis driven by the adoption of our premium RESILIA products across all regions. Physicians and patients value the feature and benefit of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve procedures. Patient enrollment continued in the second quarter for our Momentis clinical study designed to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA tissue in the mitral position. We expect that confidence from the recently presented 7-year data of our COMMENCE clinical trial will continue to support adoption of our RESILIA family of products. In Critical Care, second quarter sales of $235 million increase, 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by contribution from all product lines. Growth was led by our Smart Recovery portfolio and healthy adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor. Sales momentum for our HemoSphere monitoring platform was also positive in the second quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. Before I turn it over to Scott, I also want to mention our expectation for the upcoming TCT conference in October. During the conference, we expect several important presentation regarding our transcatheter technologies. In TAVR, we are expecting the presentation of 5-year clinical data for the (inaudible) low-risk pivotal trial. In TMTT, we anticipate the presentation of a 1-year full cohort of the Class IID pivotal trial results. Additionally, we anticipate a presentation of a planned interim analysis of a TRISCEND II randomized cohort. I look forward to seeing many of you at the investor event we plan to host at TCT. Our Investor Relations team will communicate details as we get closer to the event. And now I will turn the call over to Scott.Scott B. UllemGreat. Thanks a lot, Bernard. We are pleased with our sales performance in the first half of the year, posting our second consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. All product groups grew double digits, and sales were balanced across regions with the exception of Japan, which was impacted by the trialing of competitive TAVR products. We achieved total sales in the quarter of $1.53 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year constant currency growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. Contribution from our better-than-expected sales performance was partially offset by higher performance-based compensation and investments in our transcatheter operations in support of our growth strategy. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 was impacted by the intellectual property agreement I commented on last quarter. We previously had a long-term intellectual property agreement with Medtronic that expired last year. And in consideration for the new agreement, we paid $300 million, approximately half of which has been expensed and the other half will be amortized over the next 15 years. Reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share for these and other items is included with today's release. I'll now cover some additional details of our second quarter sales results and full year 2023 outlook by product group. A continuation of double-digit global TAVR growth reflected a more stable hospital staffing environment as well as strong adoption of the SAPIEN family of valves. U.S. TAVR sales growth was driven by the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of our U.S. TAVR sales before year-end. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the continued demand of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based by country. We still see some health system capacity challenges, but are encouraged that centers are adapting to continue to treat their patients. In Japan, although growth was below our expectations in Q2, we anticipate that growth rates will improve driven by the ongoing launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. For global TAVR sales we are adjusting the low end of our outlook slightly higher to $3.85 billion to $4.0 billion. We now expect full year TAVR growth to be 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%. TMTT growth in the second quarter was driven by strong procedure volumes, adoption of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION platform and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. Overall, we are pleased with our continued progress toward bringing a portfolio of TMTT therapies, combined with contemporary clinical data in order to achieve our vision of transforming the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. We now expect full year 2023 sales of $180 million to $200 million versus our previous expectation of $170 million to $200 million. In Surgical Structural Heart, 13% constant currency sales growth in the quarter was driven by the adoption of Edwards premium products as well as strength in valve surgery procedures as hospital staffing levels have continued to improve. Based on positive year-to-date performance, we now expect that our full year sales will be in the range of $960 million to $1.02 billion versus previous guidance of $870 million to $970 million. This revised range implies low double-digit constant currency growth in 2023. Finally, turning to Critical Care. We continue to expect full year 2023 sales of $870 million to $940 million. For total Edwards, based on the strong first half of the year, we now forecast full year 2023 sales to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion versus prior guidance of the high end of $5.6 billion to $6.0 billion. We now expect full year total company sales growth to be in the 10% to 13% range on a constant currency basis versus previous guidance of 10% to 12%. Lastly, we now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.60. We are projecting third quarter sales to be between $1.44 billion and $1.52 billion. We are also projecting third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.55 to $0.61. I'll now cover additional details of our P&amp;L. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.7%, as expected, compared to 80.5% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $469 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $409 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by performance-based compensation and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and our therapy adoption initiatives. Research and development expenses in the second quarter grew 8% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.7% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2023 we continue to expect R&amp;D to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. During the second quarter, we recorded a $27 million reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.04. This benefit was excluded from our adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. This reflects an adjustment of assumptions regarding potential milestone payments for a previous acquisition. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 9.7% or 13.1%, excluding the impact of special items. Our rate benefited from higher R&amp;D tax credits and a 200 basis point excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points or $8 million compared to 2022. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximately flat year-over-year impact to full year 2023 sales compared to 2022. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 220 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on second quarter earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was $286 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $34 million, less capital spending of $48 million and excluding a $300 million payment related to the Medtronic intellectual property agreement I mentioned earlier. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard. I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2023 to be between $610 million and $615 million. We have approximately $650 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, I'll hand it back over to you, Bernard.Bernard J. ZovighianThank you, Scott. So based on our strong first half results, we have increased confidence that 2023 will be an important year for Edwards. And we expect to deliver 10% to 13% sales growth while making meaningful progress on our innovations to improve care for many more patients. Longer term, I have great confidence in our team to further extend our leadership position by bringing our differentiated technologies to patients globally. In closing, we are well positioned for success. With that, I pass it back to Mark to open up Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionMark WilterdingThanks a lot, Bernard. With that, we're ready to take questions now. (Operator Instructions)Operator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.Robert Justin MarcusGreat. Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe to start, global TAVR growth around 10%, a little weak in Japan. Where do you think we are in the recovery process in terms of stabilizing the systems, stabilizing time lines and staffing in the system? And when do you think we'll get to a new normal in TAVR procedures and diagnosis and treatment?Bernard J. ZovighianRobbie, this is Bernard here. Thanks a lot for the question. We are pleased with our global TAVR results in Q2, 10% constant currency growth comparable U.S., OUS basically. And it has been driven by continued strong demand for our leading SAPIEN platform, also what we have experienced is an improvement in the hospital staffing level in the U.S. and globally. But I'm going to let Larry add some comments here.Larry L. WoodRobbie, yes, it's -- deciding what the new normal is, is probably a little bit tricky. But I feel like the system has continued to get better. I think when we track staffing, we're not where we should be and we're not where we would have projected to be in absence of the pandemic. But I think patients are certainly coming in and they're getting their visits. And I think when we look at some of the leading indicators, we -- diagnosis are up and patients are moving through the system. We still feel constrained somewhat at the cath lab level. That's still a place that we still struggle. And I think centers have made tremendous strides, but it's still an adjustment coming out of COVID, and we're not back to what I call pre-COVID normal levels. And so I think we still have a little ways to go. But to consider the -- and I think we see that a little bit globally, it varies a lot across Europe, and we see it a little bit in Japan depending on -- I think they're still dealing with a little bit more COVID here and there. But I think the encouraging thing is we're at 10% globally, and we know we haven't fully recovered yet. So I think there's still some opportunity for us to continue to do better. And we know the undertreatment remains huge. And we still think there's a lot of opportunities to continue to grow this over the long term.Robert Justin MarcusGreat. And maybe just kind of a similar question. TMTT, you beat in the quarter, that seems like it was even a bit more impaired over the past few years than the whole TAVR complex. Maybe just talk about mitral and tricuspid, particularly the launch of PASCAL in the U.S., how you think adoption is going versus plan? How you're seeing the competitive situation play out? And just your thoughts on TMTT in general relative to TAVR normalization?Bernard J. ZovighianYes. So let me start, Robbie, and then I will ask Daveen to add some comments here. So we are pleased about Q2, obviously, globally. What we have seen is that the market -- the mitral market has done well in Q2. It's back to growing and almost double digit, something like that. The adoption of PASCAL PRECISION is going very well. It's going very well in U.S. It's going very well in Europe. And we are activating more centers across U.S. and Europe. So this is the way to think about it, we had some great momentum from the market from PASCAL PRECISION and from us activating more centers. But Daveen, do you want to add anything here?Daveen ChopraYes, definitely. Thanks, Bernard. I think as Larry and Bernard talked about the market, we continue to see recovery from the staffing portion of it. And I think you're right that maybe we've got hit a little bit more on the staffing side during COVID, but coming out, we're also still seeing recovery, but I still think there's opportunity to keep getting better on that component. But that being said, with such a large number of such a large number of patients looking for new therapies, we continue to see relatively strong market growth. That being said, as we dive into it, we continue to open up new centers in both the U.S. and Europe. Specifically in the U.S., I think we're continuing to hear great feedback from physicians about the differentiated features and benefits of the PASCAL system. We're ramping up the team. We're opening up new centers each week. We're going through kind of the value analysis committees and the contracting processes with each new center in the U.S. week in, week out. And we're really focused, as you can imagine, on the largest accounts in the U.S., who do the most tier so far. And so I'm pretty excited about where we're going in the U.S. Maybe just a comment both on Europe. I think as Bernard said, we've been, again, opening up new centers in Europe. And I want to make a comment that tricuspid, especially in Europe continues to see very strong growth. It's a newer therapy, a little smaller, obviously, in market size, but continue to see very strong growth where we're seeing -- we're seeing that the market is growing and that people are really seeing that PASCAL actually in this situation, the tricuspid space, has really got these differentiated features for an atraumatic and tailored treatment really for tricuspid tier. So overall, we continue to be excited about where PASCAL is going in its launch.Scott B. UllemI meant about the financial implications of everything that Bernard and Daveen just talked about, which is we're feeling good about how TMTT is developing in 2023. And you saw our original guidance for sales was $160 million to $200 million. We bumped up the bottom end of the range by $10 million last quarter, bumping at another $10 million this quarter, and it's an indication of how positive we feel about our progress this year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.Matthew Charles TaylorSo I just wanted to ask one about the margins basically. So you had nice gross margins here in Q2. I know you're making a lot of ongoing investments. And so 2 things. I guess, what are kind of the key puts and takes to think about in terms of gross margins and OpEx spending through the second half of the year in terms of phasing or anything discrete to call out? And then just conceptually at a higher level, how should we think about operating margin progression over the course of the next couple of years, especially as you might have some of your bigger clinical study starting to wind up?Scott B. UllemThanks for the question. I'll start with gross margin. On gross margin, we're seeing some benefit of mix in 2023, but it's more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange that actually hit us last year in 2022 and is flowing through our income statement in 2023. You asked about phasing. It's going to get more impactful negatively in Q3 and Q4 based upon current exchange rates. Now if exchange rates change, that may change a little bit as well. But we're expecting gross margins to come down a little bit in Q3 and Q4 relative to the first half. All that said, we expect to end up right where we thought we would in the range of gross margin guidance for 2023. So really nothing changed. In terms of operating expenses, you're right, we've been putting more investment into especially field-based personnel in Europe, in the U.S. and even outside and that's weighing on operating expenses, but that's okay. It's part of a deliberate plan to really drive top line growth by making sure that we've got the right people in the right places, supporting our clinician partners and making sure that patients are getting the right kind of care, especially as we're introducing these new products in places like TMTT and what Daveen talked about earlier. As it relates to operating margin progression over the next couple of years, we continue to see opportunities to expand our operating margin, and we're looking for ways that we can do that. We've identified areas where we can make changes and gradually incrementally expand our operating margin. But really, it's a secondary focus. The primary focus is investing for long-term top line growth. Yes, some clinical trials wind down over the next couple of years, but we've got other ones spooling up. You know about what trials Larry is running in TAVR and Daveen has going in TMTT and this is a super important area of investment for us, again, to drive top line sales by contributing to this really robust body of clinical evidence that we have supporting the growth in those 2 transcatheter businesses.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.Vijay Muniyappa KumarBernard, maybe my first one on the TAVR guidance here. I think the underlying was raised at the high end to 13%. Your first half TAVR underlying has been 10% to 11%. I'm curious why the high end was raised? Was there something within the quarter that you saw some phasing? Or is there something coming in the back half, which gives you the confidence perhaps 13% is even possible?Bernard J. ZovighianGo ahead, Scott.Scott B. UllemYes. Vijay, maybe I'll jump in here and give you a sense of how we see it. the change in guidance, the expansion on the top end of the range largely reflects better-than-expected performance in the second quarter and the first half results compared to what we originally expected back at the time of the investor conference. And so because we overachieved in the first half, we are introducing this higher top end of the range to accommodate a potential faster growth scenario, the way we saw earlier in the year. We're still modeling and planning around midpoint of that 10% to 13% range, but that's the reason why we expanded the top end.Vijay Muniyappa KumarUnderstood. And maybe one sort of related question here. First half, we've seen SAVR grow mid-teens, how much of that is volume versus price? Like why are we still seeing SAVR outgrow TAVR? I think I heard Larry mention the macroenvironment staffing is improving. But I'm just -- it's so -- it's odd for us to see SAVR outgrow TAVR. Is this a fundamental change in the market or perhaps new product introductions that's driving SAVR? Some color on SAVR versus TAVR would be helpful.Bernard J. ZovighianYes. So Vijay, let me start and I will ask Larry to add his comment here. So both are -- SAVR and TAVR business are growing nicely. And the SAVR sales growth has exceeded TAVR because of a combination of things, market growth, SAVR market growth, but not only premium pricing of our innovative -- price premium technologies. And because of all of that also are better in a competitive position. So again, in SAVR, what you have is a number of things happening, where in TAVR, it is mainly procedure growth. Maybe Larry, you want to add anything here?Larry L. WoodYes, I think that's right. We sort of have the 3 components that help contribute. So you can't look at the growth rates and turn it all into procedures because for the TAVR side, it is overwhelmingly majority procedures, but it's more of a combination of things on surgery. I will say as we move through the COVID recovery, though, we probably saw hospitals prioritize their surgical programs, probably most. And I think that deals a little bit with patient acuity and just the need to get those patients treated probably a little bit sooner. So I think cath lab recoveries maybe lagged a little bit beyond the surgical recovery. But again, we're very happy with where we saw TAVR procedure growth this last quarter.OperatorOur next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.Lawrence H. BiegelsenTwo on the pipeline and the TCT updates on this call. Let me start with the TRISCEND II comments. It's big news here. Arguably, EVOQUE is your most important pipeline products. So I guess my question is, Bernard, are -- just a couple here. One, has the trial stopped yet? Second, what would success look like to you given the TRILUMINATE results, showed only a quality of life benefit but no positive trends on hard outcomes? And lastly, on TRISCEND II, if positive, I would think approval could come in mid-'24, not late '24. And I did have 1 follow-up.Bernard J. ZovighianThank you, Larry. I feel that you are aggressive, that's good. Look, we have indeed -- we completed the enrollment of a full cohort of TRISCEND II. I think we have been sharing that already in the past. We need to wait 1 year follow-up and then putting together all of the data, presenting that to the FDA. So this is going to take some time. So it is why we still believe that around 2024 approval in the U.S. is reasonable. Are we going to go faster? For sure. But I think end of 2024 is reasonable. Now I'm sure your question about how do we feel about study results is in light of what we have seen with TRILUMINATE. It is tough to comment because TRILUMINATE was using 1 technology, TRISCEND II is using a different technology, different devices, we don't know very little about tricuspid disease. So it's very tough to comment on that. But I have to say that quality of life is super important for patients. So we will -- again, we will have to see what the result of this study and we are confident. Daveen, do you want to add anything here?Daveen ChopraYes. I'll just add 2 small points. Thanks for the question. Is that this interim analysis was a part of the statistical plan, so it's already been planned out and was always a part to kind of show these results. So we're excited to share these results with the clinical community. And I'll make the other comment that for us, I'm actually pretty excited by what we've seen actually previously with TRILUMINATE. Is it helps really confirm outcomes that have come from other studies with tier technologies that we have on the PASCAL device, that tier in tricuspid delivers great tricuspid reduction with meaningful quality of life improvements. And we are excited to see randomized data. So to me, these are all great positive tailwinds in tricuspid and we're excited to see what the TRISCEND II interim planned analysis will show.Lawrence H. BiegelsenThat's helpful. Just for my follow-up, the other one on the partner 3 -- 5-year data. What do you think physicians will be focused on here? There's been some concern among investors and clinicians given the curves converging between TAVR and SAVR between year 1 and 2 in the 2-year data. Is there anything you can say that could allay concerns?Larry L. WoodWell, I can't speak to the data or what's going to be presented. I think what people are going to be looking at is what the trial was powered for and what it was designed to do. And we have a composite endpoint of death, all stroke and rehospitalization. And those are the 3 components. So I think first and foremost, if you look at the primary. And then I think people are going to look at the subcomponents of that and say, what do they see happening in the trends in the trial? And I think that's what people are going to be looking for. But we're excited to -- the data is coming forward, and the team is going to continue pulling it in. And once it's all adjudicated, the clinicians will obviously take the steering wheel and they'll present the data. But I think overall, every time we have one of these data reports, it just adds to our body of knowledge and adds to the body of evidence. And I think that's what we do for the clinical community. So again, I think primarily, we focus on the primary endpoint just like we did in the trial, and we see -- and we'll see where we are.OperatorOur next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.Travis Lee SteedI just wanted to follow up on U.S. TAVR growth. I wanted to understand a little bit better. I think you said price was stable but it sounds like RESILIA is going faster than expected. I don't know if there's any way to kind of parse out that U.S. sounds like 10% TAVR growth in the U.S., how much of that was actually priced versus RESILIA in the quarter?Larry L. WoodYes, thanks for your question. Yes, the price is a pretty small factor in the U.S. growth number. It's overwhelmingly driven by the procedure growth. When you look at what we're going for RESILIA, for S3 UR. We're still in the -- I call it the -- I wouldn't call it necessarily the early part, but we haven't even reached halfway in the launch of RESILIA yet. And while we did go for a list price increase of 1,500, if you look at that as a percent of the total device cost, it's a lot smaller than what we did on the surgical side of things. So it's certainly a contributor and it's a long-term contributor for us, but it's pretty small in comparison to the procedure growth. And remember, too, as people's volumes go up, they continue to hit rebate tiers and they get discounted accordingly. So you got to factor all that in as well.Travis Lee SteedGreat. That's helpful. And then I did have a follow-up on the raised TAVR guide for the full year. Is there anything you're seeing in July? Just curious like what's giving you the confidence to raise the full year guide? And when you think about Q3, should we think about this being down sequentially versus Q2 in dollars like it has been historically?Scott B. UllemYes. It's Scott. A couple of things. The increase in the guide was largely reflective of our stronger-than-expected first half performance and the prospect of potentially overachieving what we had modeled for the second half, although we're still modeling the midpoint of that range that we provided. As far as the July expectation, I guess we'll just leave it as the range that we put out for total company sales in the third quarter incorporates what we see so far month-to-date, but we're not going to get into the month-to-month report. In terms of what the later in the year trend may look like, a lot of it depends upon seasonality. We get hit by the summer vacation season and not just in Europe but also in the U.S. And so we'll be able to talk more about that impact when we get to our third quarter call, both for looking back on the third quarter and what the run rate looks like going into Q4.OperatorAnd your next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.Joshua Thomas Jennings(inaudible) 2 questions. One, first, just on the Japan recovery. Can you just talk about or share any insights into the (inaudible)...OperatorExcuse me, Josh, you're cutting out. Could you pick up your handset?Joshua Thomas JenningsSure. Can you hear me now?OperatorYes, much better. Thank you.Joshua Thomas JenningsSorry about that. Just 2 TAVR questions. First one, on the Japan recovery trajectory. Maybe just help us better understand any factors that are limiting the recovery in Japan and how you see that market shaping up in the back half of the year. And then the second question on -- just on the PROGRESS trial. Any updates on the enrollment pace, I believe, first patient was enrolled in close to the end of 2021. So we've been about 1.5 years of enrollment and could that trial complete enrollment in 2023 or in 2024?Bernard J. ZovighianThank you, Josh. So in Japan, what we have seen is a positive, like I said, sequential and also year-over-year growth in the quarter. It was below our expectation, but we believe it is transient for a couple of reasons. One, of the market, as you know, the market is still impacted from COVID and is still recovering from COVID. And also, we believe it is transient because we are very pleased with the early feedback of the launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan. So we feel like we grew year-over-year sequentially below our expectation, but we are confident that we are going to improve this in Japan. Maybe, Larry, you want to add anything here?Larry L. WoodYes, I think that's right. I think Japan certainly got more impacted during COVID waves, I think, even than some other regions in the last year probably. And so as that stabilizes, we think that, that helps. And as Bernard said, we did see growth year-over-year and sequential. We just probably had higher expectations. And -- and I think that's what's reflected in our comments. But we're optimistic in the back half of the year that we're going to continue to see recovery in Japan, and that's all factored into our guidance. On PROGRESS, we don't have any updates on enrollment right now. I will say, overall, we've been pleased with how that trial has gone. But probably investor conferences when we'll probably provide a more fulsome update on that and probably some more projections, we'll have a lot more information under our belt then that we can probably be a little more fulsome probably a little bit more accurate about our projections.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.Christopher Thomas PasqualeScott, the 3Q EPS guidance is a little bit lower than the Street was modeling. It looks like operating margin is expected to contract by a couple of hundred basis points versus where you were in the first half and then bounce back in 4Q. Is there anything in particular about the third quarter that drives that margin dip?Scott B. UllemWell, the only thing particularly about Q3 is we pick up the summer seasonality, which hits us on the top line. And generally, the expenses continue to go through and are not as seasonal. That's really what it reflects.Christopher Thomas PasqualeOkay. And I know Catherine is not on the call today, but just looking at the Critical Care guidance, that business has been running hot here double-digit growth first half of the year. It looks like guidance assumes a pretty meaningful decel in the back half. Is that just tougher comps? Or is there something in particular you're looking at there?Bernard J. ZovighianNo, exactly. You got it. We had a great Q2 after a great Q1, very balanced across all product lines. And we didn't change the guidance even though we changed the guidance in the last quarter, but it is more about a tough year-over-year comparison in the second part of the year. Thanks for the question.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays.Matthew Stephan MiksicSo I wanted to follow up on this very strong performances in SAVR and good, but not as strong performance in TAVR and as a [percent] to staffing. And I know you talked about price a little and volumes. But can you talk a little bit about given that TAVR interventional TAVR resources that sort of grew up during the clinical trials of TAVR across the clinical community in U.S., Europe kind of lost many of those folks who are maybe more proficient and are -- good news, replacing them with other folks, but bad news, maybe some of those folks are still coming up the curve. If you could talk about -- is that more of an issue on the TAVR side? And because SAVR surgical interventions are a bit more mature, that's less of an issue on -- you've heard that from some centers that are sort of -- are more productive, more skilled, more mature on one side versus the other, which is kind of one of the factors. But it would be great to get some color and then I have 1 quick follow-up.Larry L. WoodOkay. Sure. Let me take a shot at that. So probably the biggest place we saw turnover on the TAVR side of the things were valve clinic coordinators. And I think we talked before about the number of valve clinic coordinators we train. And I think part of that is just a really demanding job. There's a lot that goes into that in terms of screening and moving people through the system. And so I think there's a lot. So we see a little bit more turnover than that than certainly. And we don't really have the same level of work on the surgical side because on the TAVR side, remember, patients have to get a CT. They have to have a lot more work up. And not every patient gets the -- most surgical patients, in fact, don't get a CT. And so it's just easier to move surgical patients through the process because literally, if a patient comes in and they're deemed a candidate for surgery, they can move right to surgery within a matter of a few days or a week. Where for TAVR, they're going to have to be scheduled for a [CT], you got to roll out coronary disease and there's just other things that you have to do. So there are pressure in staffing in the system that would have impacted across the whole system, but there's just more systems to impact on the TAVR side. We didn't lose our operators. If not -- those aren't the people we lost. We didn't lose our operators. We still have a lot of residents and a lot of people coming up through the system. So it's not so much the implanting positions as much as it is just general support staff.Matthew Stephan MiksicGot it. That's helpful. And then just on -- it's a question about some of the investments you've made and maybe (inaudible) Bernard and rest of the team, the investments that we see coming through the clinical programs now like the EVOQUE and PASCAL or investments and innovations that you made some time ago. And I'm just wondering -- are you at a stage where you've got what you need to address these TMTT markets and sort of more advanced other valvular disorders? Or are you still out there hunting for sort of better mousetraps or additional technology and IP that we should expect to kind of further flesh out those programs going forward?Bernard J. ZovighianThanks, Matt. This is a very good question. So think about our vision in TMTT. Our vision is there are so many patients in need, mitral and tricuspid. And we believe that to be able to unlock this very large market opportunity, we need a comprehensive portfolio. And we are building this comprehensive portfolio. So what you can expect is us investing in innovation, next-gen innovation. So PASCAL Gen 2, Gen 3, Gen 4, the same with EVOQUE, the same with mitral replacement. So this is on the technology side. Then we know from our experience in TAVR, it is -- you need a technology with evidence. In TAVR, we -- I don't know how many randomized clinical study we did 3, 4, 5 or even more potentially in the space, probably close to 10 between us and our competition. So here, we will have to think about the same way. So we are -- in my mind, we are not done at all in TMTT clinical evidence, and we are not done in terms of further innovating to be able to treat all of the patients, mitral and tricuspid patients. We like definitely our technology, we like so far, our clinical evidence that we are providing and more to come.OperatorOur next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.Danielle Joy AntalffyBernard or maybe, Larry, just on TAVR, 2 questions there. Number one, one of the things everyone's sort of trying to figure out as we move through Q2, is it impacted backlog. I know the high acuity nature of the TAVR procedure are likely not much backlog, and I know you did benefit marginally in Q1. Just curious if you think you saw any of that work down in Q2? That's the first question. Second question is just over the last few quarters, you gave some color on high volume versus low-volume centers driving a lot of the growth. Just curious if you could give some color there, whether this is really broad-based across low and high-volume centers.Larry L. WoodYes. Thanks, Danielle. Yes, we think as the front end of the funnel starts to fill back up again with referrals and that I think there is a possibility that we are actually seeing a little bit of a backlog growth as we talk about the last mile still being probably the part that we see the most pressure on staffing. I wouldn't be able to quantify that and it's probably just sort of more of a directional thing. But the fact that we've seen the growth in TAVR for the first couple of quarters of this year, and we've been back into double digits and it's not like our centers are out beating the bushes for patients, we're pretty pleased with our patient flow right now. So I think that, that's obviously really positive. I think in terms of large centers, small centers, we saw a dynamic throughout COVID that when COVID would -- with sort of the way it would come through that people -- we tend to see the smaller centers growing faster indicating people maybe stayed a little bit more local. When COVID tends to go away, then people tend to go back to the centers, the large centers of excellence and they're willing to travel a little bit more. So I think we saw a little bit more growth in the large centers in this past quarter than we saw in the small centers, but that's something that has varied a lot quarter by quarter. But this last quarter would have been more in the large centers than the small ones.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.Richard Samuel NewitterTwo here. The first one, just on reconciling the raise to the high end of the TAVR range and your Japan commentary relative to expectations, do you need Japan and the dynamic way to improve in the second half to hit the midpoint of your guidance? Or is that kind of what's embedded to get to the upper end? I'm just trying to reconcile those 2 pieces.Scott B. UllemYes. We're expecting Japan to perform better in Q3 and Q4, and that's a contributor to our assumption about the midpoint of the range. Now Japan does better than we're expecting, that could get us into the higher end of the range. And if it does worse, then a lower end of the range. All of that said, Japan is still a pretty small percentage of our overall sales in TAVR, but it's an important one, and it's an important growth driver for us longer term.Richard Samuel NewitterOkay. And then just secondly -- secondly, just -- as we think about -- especially in the U.S. TAVR, if you're at about 10% now, you've got RESILIA pricing contributing some amount. So I guess if you're 10% with RESILIA, as we just think out, whether it's '24 or just on a normalized basis, should we be thinking of your view that the TAVR market has approached high single-digit volume growth sustainably as we think back to normalized levels. Is that the right way to think about it?Larry L. WoodI'll try to answer that, and Bernard or Scott can certainly jump in as well. No, we don't think we're seeing an overall slowing of growth in the TAVR space. We think we actually have a pretty long runway here. We think there's still a lot of untreated patients in the system, and we continue to try to get through that. And as I said earlier, I still feel like we're somewhat constrained within the system for staffing and we still put double-digit growth on the board in the first 2 quarters. So I feel like there's still a long-term opportunity, and we haven't even begun to talk about the long-term impact of things like early TAVR and things like progress trial that obviously go out much further. So I think -- try to think that this is going to go the way of population growth anytime soon. That's just not how we see it.Scott B. UllemI'd just add to that, Larry, just to reinforce that, our confidence in a $10 billion total addressable market hasn't changed one bit in 2028. And so while COVID interrupted our trajectory to that larger TAM, we still feel a lot of confidence that we've got big growth ahead of us, not just in with current indications in our current product portfolio but added to that, our new technologies and broader indications in the U.S., Europe and beyond.OperatorOur next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.Philip ChickeringSo 2 quick questions here. For the U.S. markets, are there -- is there any geographical spread for these large centers that are growing in markets that were still coming out of COVID versus the ones in the south that were faster coming out of COVID? Or was it broad-based geographically?Larry L. WoodYes. When we were in the middle of COVID, we saw a lot of variation in the country based on where COVID was at any given point and because there was a lot of variation in health care policy for various different states in terms of how they reacted. So we saw a lot of different variations. I would say most of those restrictions have sort of dissipated now. And I don't -- we're not seeing anywhere near that high variability from state to state or region to region that we used to see, and that's certainly true in the U.S. In Europe, we do see a little bit of regional impact a little bit more, where 1 regional enrolling faster than another region. But it's not anywhere near the exchange that we saw during COVID, where we saw huge swings now. They're much more muted now. And I would say we -- if I look back through history, we've always seen a little variation in Europe from country to country. So it feels like it's maybe not normal, but it's getting pretty close to normal, I guess, I'd say.Philip ChickeringOkay. Fair enough. And then like with the competitor talking about lower U.S. growth in mitral and they need to restart the referral network. Can you talk about what you think the overall micro market grew in the market, how your market share is looking and any changes to your long-term market growth of that market?Bernard J. ZovighianSo let me start here and Daveen, you can add some comments. What we have seen is a nice recovery in Q1 and in Q2 in the mitral market in the U.S. and even in Europe. But I'm sure, Daveen, you have more precise commentary here to add?Daveen ChopraYes, sure. No, definitely. I think I'll follow up and I say the overall TMTT market with both tricuspid and mitral continues to grow very well on a global basis, right, in that -- close to that maybe 20% kind of mark, globally. In the U.S., though, to specifically we're just in mitral, we do see strong growth. I think, Bernard, were saying something like almost like double-digit growth, which is about the ballpark we kind of see in for U.S. mitral. So we think it's there, but not as strong as it is on the global nature. As you remember, in many countries of the world, these technologies are just coming for the first time in there. We're still launching this technology into many, many countries. We're in very few countries -- there are countries in Europe, countries outside of Europe that we haven't even launched into yet. So we continue to see, as we launch in new countries, that will help the market grow as well as the continued adoption of mitral in the U.S.OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.Adam Carl MaederTwo TAVR-related questions, I'll ask them both upfront. First on the ALLIANCE study, it sounds like that's going to restart enrollment this quarter. Can you just talk about the effects or improvements to get SAPIEN X4 back in the clinic? And remind us where we are in terms of enrollment with that study. And then the second question is just a clarification on S3 Ultra RESILIA. I know you're launching that, obviously, here in the States. I think that's approved in Japan in launching. What is the status that -- of that technology in Europe?Larry L. WoodSure. Thanks. Well, in terms of the changes we made to X4, they were all delivery system related. So there weren't any changes made to the valve or anything along those lines, which is why we were able to make the changes pretty quickly and get back in the clinic. And so we're really pleased where we are. And we're all approved to begin enrollment. Now all the centers have to go back in and go back to the IRBs and whatnot. But we have a number of centers that are already greenlight and ready to go. So we expect to begin enrollment again very, very shortly. And I'm not ready to give an update on enrollment, much probably like PROGRESS. We'll probably do that at the investor conference once we have a little bit more of a run because it's not really about where we are, it's projecting where we think we're going to finish. And so I'd rather give you a more fulsome answer on that a little bit later. S3 UR, we're working with European regulators on that. But remember, there's been a huge change in the regulations in Europe to the MDR process. And there's also just a huge bottleneck in terms of the number of devices that are working their way through the system there. So we don't have any timing on that. Frankly, all the notified bodies are sort of learning about how the new regulations play and as are all the sponsors. So we don't have any timing on that yet. But we do have it approved in Japan, and that launch is well underway. We do have it approved in the U.S., and that's underway. And in both of those markets, we expect that to be the majority platform as we exit the year.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Bernard Zovighian for closing remarks.Bernard J. ZovighianThanks, Diego. So let me close this meeting by saying I am excited about our performance so far in 2023 and confident in our outlook for the rest of the year. In addition, beyond the numbers, I am pleased with our progress on pipeline development, clinical trial and confidence in our long-term strategy to help even more patients. Thank you for your continued interest in Edwards, Mark, Oliver, Scott and I welcome any additional questions by phone.OperatorThank you. And that concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good evening.]"

constant currency sales grew 10 percentQ2 EPS of $0.50 (includes charge from previous IP agreement); adjusted1 EPS of $0.66Encouraging data from Edwards' Benchmark Registry at the EuroPCR medical congressNew 2023 constant currency sales growth guidance of 10 to 13 percent""We are pleased to report strong second quarter double-digit sales growth while also making meaningful progress on our innovations to improve patient care globally,"" said Bernard Zovighian, CEO.  ""This positive first-half performance and improved healthcare staffing gives us increased confidence in our full-year outlook.  Looking beyond 2023, we remain confident that our foundation of innovative therapies along with a differentiated technology pipeline positions us well for continued longer-term success.""Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)For the quarter, the company reported TAVR sales of $992 million, which grew 9 percent versus the prior year, or 10 percent on a constant currency basis.  The company's U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were comparable.  Globally, on a constant currency basis, the company's average selling prices were stable.In the U.S., Edwards' TAVR sales were aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, which remains on track to represent the majority of the company's U.S. TAVR sales before year end.Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, Edwards had positive constant currency sales growth from all regions, although lower than expected growth in Japan.  The company sees excellent opportunities for international growth as the traditionally low adoption rates improve.Story continuesDuring the quarter, at the EuroPCR medical congress, data on the Benchmark Registry were presented on 2,400 patients treated with SAPIEN valves across 28 European centers.  Patients experienced a 33 percent reduction in the median hospital length of stay while maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes.Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT)In the second quarter, the company continued to successfully deliver on its three key value drivers to treat even more patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid disease: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcomes.Second quarter sales were $48 million, driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth as well as the ongoing launch and growing adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe and the U.S.  The company continues to expect one-year data from the full cohort of the CLASP IID pivotal trial will be presented later this year.  Edwards remains on track for European approval of the EVOQUE tricuspid valve by the end of 2023.Surgical Structural Heart and Critical CareSurgical Structural Heart sales for the quarter were $256 million, which grew 12 percent, or 13 percent on a constant currency basis.  The growth was driven by adoption of Edwards' premium RESILIA based products across all regions.Critical Care sales for the quarter were $235 million, which grew 11 percent, or 13 percent on a constant currency basis.  Sales growth was led by the Smart Recovery technology portfolio and strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor.Additional Financial ResultsFor the quarter, the adjusted gross profit margin was 77.7 percent, compared to 80.5 percent in the same period last year.  As expected, this year-over-year reduction was driven by a less favorable impact from foreign exchange.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $469 million, or 30.6 percent of sales, compared to $409 million in the prior year.  This increase was driven by performance-based compensation and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of the company's growth strategy.Research and development expenses in the second quarter were $270 million, or 17.7 percent of sales, compared to $251 million in the prior year.  This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in the company's transcatheter aortic valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity.As previously announced, in April, Edwards entered into an intellectual property agreement.  In consideration for the agreement, Edwards made a $300 million payment, approximately half of which has been expensed, while the other half is being amortized over the next 15 years.Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was $286 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $34 million, less capital spending of $48 million, and excluding a $300 million payment related to the intellectual property agreement.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2023. Total debt was approximately $600 million.OutlookOverall, given the improving environment and strong first half performance, the company now expects full year 2023 sales to be in the $5.9 to $6.1 billion range, versus the prior guidance of the high end of $5.6 to $6.0 billion.  The company now expects full-year total company and TAVR sales growth to be in the 10 to 13 percent range on a constant currency basis, versus previous guidance of 10 to 12 percent.  The company now expects TAVR sales of $3.85 to $4.0 billion; TMTT, $180 to $200 million; and Surgical Structural Heart, $960 million to $1.02 billion.  The company reiterated its full-year Critical Care guidance of $870 to $940 million.Additionally, the company is lifting its full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.50 to $2.60, compared to its previous guidance range of $2.48 to $2.60.For the third quarter of 2023, the company projects total sales to be between $1.44 and $1.52 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.55 to $0.61.""The exciting developments during the first half of the year reinforce our confidence in our patient-focused innovation strategy and our longer-term outlook, and we anticipate a year of value creation as we pursue important therapies that will benefit many more patients.  We look forward to launching a number of differentiated technologies, as well as achieving important milestones across all of our product lines,"" said Zovighian.About Edwards LifesciencesEdwards Lifesciences is the global leader of patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.  We are driven by a passion for patients, dedicated to improving and enhancing lives through partnerships with clinicians and stakeholders across the global healthcare landscape.

InformationTo supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), the Company uses non-GAAP historical financial measures.  Management makes adjustments to the GAAP measures for items (both charges and gains) that (a) do not reflect the core operational activities of the Company, (b) are commonly adjusted within the Company's industry to enhance comparability of the Company's financial results with those of its peer group, or (c) are inconsistent in amount or frequency between periods (albeit such items are monitored and controlled with equal diligence relative to core operations).  The Company uses the term ""underlying"" when referring to non-GAAP sales and sales growth information, which excludes currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses the term ""adjusted"" to also exclude intellectual property litigation expenses, intellectual property agreements, amortization of intangible assets, and fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions.Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results, and evaluating current performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations by investors that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and facilitate comparability to historical periods.Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP historical financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables below.Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more useful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of the fluctuations has been detailed in the ""Reconciliation of Sales by Product Group and Region.""Guidance for sales and sales growth rates is provided on an ""underlying basis,"" and projections for diluted earnings per share, net income and growth, gross profit margin, taxes, and free cash flow are also provided on a non-GAAP basis, as adjusted, for the items identified above due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items without unreasonable efforts.  The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance to comparable GAAP measures due to the unknown effect, timing, and potential significance of special charges or gains, and management's inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives.Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by business operations, after deducting payments for capital expenditures, which can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet, and repurchasing stock.The items described below are adjustments to the GAAP financial results in the reconciliations that follow:Intellectual Property Litigation Expenses - The Company incurred intellectual property litigation expenses of $6.5 million and $7.1 million in the first quarter of  2023 and 2022, respectively, and $8.9 million and $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively.Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities - The Company recorded expense of $0.7 million and a gain of $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and gains of $26.9 million and $20.9 million in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of its contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions.Amortization of Intangible Assets - The Company recorded amortization expense related to developed technology and patents in the amount of $1.5 million and $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $1.3 million and $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively.Intellectual Property Agreement - The Company recorded a $37.0 million charge and a $139.0 million charge in the first and second quarter of 2023, respectively, related to an Intellectual Property Agreement with Medtronic, Inc. for a 15-year covenant not to sue.Provision for Income Taxes - The income tax impact of the expenses and gains discussed above is based upon the items' forecasted effect upon the Company's full year effective tax rate. Adjustments to forecasted items unrelated to the expenses and gains above, as well as impacts related to interim reporting, will have an effect on the income tax impact of these items in subsequent periods.EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATIONUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information(in millions, except per share and percentage data)Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Net

CAT, Walmart Inc. WMT, HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA and Monolithic Power Systems MPWR.5 Dividend Stocks with Strong Prospects to BuyDividend investing is in demand once again, given the uncertainties around the Fed's future actions Though dividend-paying stocks don’t offer dramatic price appreciation, they can provide a consistent income stream. In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns.Stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — KB Home, Caterpillar Inc., Walmart Inc., HCA Healthcare Inc. and Monolithic Power Systems — that could be compelling picks for investors.Inside Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term.

36,68a21c02-00fd-30b1-9f38-4919eb0ce928,WMT,2023-07-27,PepsiCo and Walmart Aim to Support Regenerative Agriculture Across More than 2 Million Acres of Farmland,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-walmart-aim-support-regenerative-150000640.html,1690383600,STORY,"['WMT', 'PEP']","[PURCHASE, N.Y. and BENTONVILLE, Ark., July 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- PepsiCo and Walmart today announced a 7-year collaboration to pursue $120 million worth of investments focused on supporting U.S. and Canadian farmers in their pursuit to improve soil health and water quality. By establishing and scaling financial, agronomic and social programs, it aims to enable and accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland and deliver approximately 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals by 2030 – roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity needed to power 778,300 homes for one year1.PepsiCo (PRNewsfoto/PepsiCo, Inc.)Commenting on the voluntary adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, Jeff Huffman, Owner &amp; Operator of Island Farms LLC in Maxwell, Neb., said, ""From my perspective, embracing regenerative agriculture is essential. It's good for farmers, not only because it's beneficial to the environment and our food quality, but also for the profitability of our businesses. If you use less fertilizer and you grow a bigger crop, or if you use less water and can still grow the same size of crop, it strengthens your farm in a way that benefits the bottom line and our environment for generations to come.""PepsiCo's and Walmart's businesses are dependent on farmers to grow ingredients that are used to make the delicious products that consumers enjoy every day. With a supply chain for the two companies that stretches across North America and involves a large volume of critical crops – including potatoes, oats, corn, wheat, soybean and rice – sustainability will look different from commodity to commodity, region to region, and even farm to farm. The collaboration between PepsiCo and Walmart offers a voluntary, flexible approach to regenerative agriculture that gives farmers a seat at the table, recognizes the diversity of agriculture and that one size does not fit all.Story continues""Successful sustainability starts and ends with trust. At PepsiCo, we work very hard to earn the trust of the farmer so they understand that we are investing in their legacy and they can hand their farm down to the next generation,"" said Jim Andrew, Chief Sustainability Officer, PepsiCo. ""Farmers know their business better than anyone else, and what we hear from them is that for regenerative agriculture to make business sense, three things need to happen. They need economic support, social and cultural support, and agronomic support. This strategic collaboration with Walmart will advance our shared goal to have farmers' backs as they transform farming in a way that benefits the planet and people.""""At Walmart, our sustainability strategy is built to make the everyday choice the sustainable choice for our customers. This collaboration with PepsiCo is a great example of how we are prioritizing the expansion of regenerative agricultural practices among farmers across North America so that we can continue to make quality products affordable and accessible for customers. This collaboration aims to help elevate farmer livelihoods, engage them on how to more sustainably manage soil health, increase yields and create a model that others can mimic across other product categories, including encouraging additional investments in regenerative agriculture by other brands,"" said Jane Ewing, Senior Vice President for sustainability at Walmart.PepsiCo and Walmart have a shared focus on supporting farming communities while improving soil and water health, as well as lowering carbon emissions. As the largest convenient food and beverage company in North America, a resilient food system is essential to PepsiCo's business and its ability to meet its ambitious pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) goals, which include driving the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres by 2030 – an area approximately the size of PepsiCo's agricultural footprint – and reducing absolute GHG emissions by more than 40% across its entire value chain by 2030 (against a 2015 baseline) while striving toward net-zero emissions by 2040.""This effort is a new model for PepsiCo, marking our first, large-scale strategic collaboration focused on sustainable agriculture with a retail partner,"" said Steven Williams, Chief Executive Officer, PepsiCo Foods North America. ""Farmers are critical to our business, and many of the brands our consumers know and love rely on ingredients that we source straight from the farm. By joining forces with Walmart, we'll be empowering farmers through education, upfront investment in outcomes, peer coaching, and cost-sharing – and hopefully inspiring others to join us.""This collaboration is a key example of how Walmart is prioritizing purposeful collaborations to accelerate the adoption of regenerative practices in line with its goal to protect, restore or more sustainably manage 50 million acres of land and 1 million square miles of ocean by 2030 along with the Walmart Foundation.For more information about pep+, please click here.

39,d0d29568-d0b0-3ea3-a1e3-0d672e51ecbf,WMT,2023-07-27,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Walmart (WMT): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133006264.html,1690378206,STORY,['WMT'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Walmart (WMT).Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.47, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.47 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69% and 13.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Walmart, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is WMT a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $6.22.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

40,70cc9fe7-3918-3702-bf38-1b1a44c4d998,WMT,2023-07-27,Walmart Inc. (WMT) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-wmt-hits-fresh-131503511.html,1690377303,STORY,['WMT'],"[Shares of Walmart (WMT) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $160.52 in the previous session. Walmart has gained 12.3% since the start of the year compared to the 17.5% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 12.6% return for the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 18, 2023, Walmart reported EPS of $1.47 versus consensus estimate of $1.32.For the current fiscal year, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $6.22 per share on $636.67 billion in revenues. This represents a -1.11% change in EPS on a 4.15% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.87 per share on $659.5 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.52% and 3.59%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWalmart may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Walmart has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 25.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.3X versus its peer group's average of 6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 4.66. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Walmart currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Walmart meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Walmart shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?Story continuesPaul Christopher ReillyGood evening. Thank you for joining us today. Since our last earnings call, we hosted our 2 major adviser conferences for both the independent and employee affiliation channels and also had our Chairman's Council Recognition Trip for our top employee advisers. I'm so proud of our advisers unwavering dedication to serving their clients and helping them to navigate these volatile and uncertain times.Our advisers have also expressed their appreciation of our commitment to managing the firm for the long term and always striving to be a source of strength and stability for them and their clients. It's these shared values that have resulted in our success through multiple cycles since our founding and what makes me confident about our continued success in the future.Now turning to our results. Despite the challenging environment and elevated market volatility since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, we generated record net revenues and earnings for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Reviewing third quarter results, starting on Slide 4. The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.9 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $369 million or $1.71 per diluted share.Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $399 million or $1.85 per diluted share. The increase in interest-related revenues driven by higher short-term interest rates drove significant earnings growth over the prior year.Net revenues increased 7%, and net income available to common shareholders grew 23%. Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million, and bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million, which was predominantly driven by significantly weakened macroeconomic assumptions for the Moody's CRE price index utilized in our CECL models.Notwithstanding these items, we had a solid quarter in a tough market environment. We generated strong returns with annualized returns on common equity of 14.9% and annualized adjusted returns on tangible common equity of 19.7%. We believe this is a leading result, especially considering our strong capital base.Moving to Slide 5. The strength of our PCG business really shine driving record assets this quarter. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.28 trillion, record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $697 billion and financial assets under management of $201 billion.With our continued focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisers, PCG consistently generates strong organic growth, which was evident again this quarter with domestic net new assets of $14.4 billion, representing a 5.4% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.However, I'll note net new assets in our adviser count were negatively impacted by an independent contractor relationship whose affiliation with the firm ended in the fiscal third quarter. This was a planned in mutual separation and more than 60% of the assets and advisers stayed with Raymond James. The impact of the portion that moved off the platform this quarter was $4.6 billion in assets and 60 financial advisers through our net new asset metric would have been even stronger after adjusting for this separation, which we do not believe will negatively impact our profitability.During the prior 12 months, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial advisers with approximately $282 million of trailing 12-month production and nearly $38 billion of client assets at their previous firms. Total clients' domestic suite and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 11% from March of 2023.The enhanced savings program with its competitive rate and robust FDIC insurance continue to attract significant cash this quarter, offsetting a decline in client suite balances, largely due to quarterly fee billings and tax payments in April. Total bank loans decreased 1% from the preceding quarter to $43 billion, primarily reflecting a modest decline in corporate loans as new origination demand continues to be tepid in the market.Moving to Slide 6. Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.18 billion and pretax income of $411 million. Year-over-year asset-based revenues declined due to market decline. However, PCG results were lifted by the benefit of higher interest rates and interest-related revenues and fees.The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $276 million and a pretax loss of $34 million. Revenues declined 28% compared to the prior year quarter, mostly driven by lower Investment Banking revenues as well as lower Fixed Income brokerage revenues. The extremely challenging market environment, particularly for Investment Banking, has strained the near-term profitability of the segment's results.As we explained at Analyst and Investor Day, the segment's results are negatively impacted by amortization of share-based compensation for prior years as well as growth investments. However, we are focused on managing controllable expenses as near-term revenues are depressed. The Asset Management segment generated pretax income of $89 million on net revenues of $226 million. The increase in net revenues and pretax income over the preceding quarter were largely the result of higher assets and fee-based accounts.The Bank segment generated net revenues of $514 million and pretax income of $66 million. Third quarter NIM for the Bank segment of 3.26%, rose 85 basis points over the year ago quarter, but as expected, decreased 37 basis points from the preceding quarter, primarily due to higher funding costs. We continue to add diverse higher-cost funding sources and shifted more of the lower-cost suite funding to third-party banks.While this negatively impacted the Bank segment's NIM, Paul Shoukry will walk us through how this benefits both clients and the firm overall. Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7. We generated record net revenues of $8.6 billion and record net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion, up 5% and 22%, respectively, over the prior year's records.We aren't seeing many other firms in our industry generate record so far this year. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.7% for the 9-month period. On Slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Bank segments for the first 9 months of the year primarily reflects the benefit of strong organic growth in the Private Client Group, the successful integration of TriState Capital and higher interest-related revenues.When compared to the record activity levels in the year ago period, weaker capital markets results reflect the challenging environment for Investment Banking and Fixed Income brokerage revenue despite incremental revenues from the SumRidge acquisition. And now I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results. Paul?Paul M. ShoukryThank you, Paul. Starting on Slide 10. Consolidated net revenues were a record $2.91 billion in the third quarter, up 7% over the prior year and 1% sequentially. Being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a period when capital market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having diverse and complementary businesses anchored by the Private Client Group business, which reached record client assets this quarter.Asset Management and related administrative fees declined 4% compared to the prior year quarter and increased 5% sequentially due to the higher assets and fee-based accounts at the end of the preceding quarter, along with 1 additional billable day in the fiscal third quarter. This quarter, fee-based assets grew 5% to a new record, providing a tailwind for Asset Management and related administrative fees in the fiscal fourth quarter.Brokerage revenues of $461 million, declined 10% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. This year-over-year decline was largely due to lower Fixed Income brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment as well as lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG.I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment Banking revenues of $151 million, declined 32% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. As experience across the industry, both underwriting and M&amp;A revenues continue to be challenged this quarter. We are optimistic that the environment is improving, and we continue to see a healthy Investment Banking pipeline and solid new business activity.However, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing of deals launching and closing given the heightened market volatility. So while we may not see significant improvement in the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect better results over the next 6 to 12 months.Moving to Slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and enhanced saving program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 11% over the preceding quarter and representing 5.2% of domestic PCG client assets. Advisers continue to serve their clients effectively, leveraging our competitive cash offerings. The enhanced savings program attracted approximately $8.5 billion in new deposits this quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming into ESP has been new cash brought to the firm by advisers, highlighting the attractiveness of this product and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.The enhanced savings program balances exceeded $11.9 billion this week, continuing to grow modestly and partially offsetting the decline in sweep balances largely due to the approximately $1.3 billion of quarterly fee billings in July. As I said on last quarter's call, it feels like we are closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic than we are to the beginning. And we have certainly seen a deceleration of the activity over the past several months. However, we are not ready to declare the end of that dynamic. We will need more time with stable balances and interest rates. This quarter's sweep balances with third-party banks increased $7.5 billion to $16.9 billion, giving us a large funding cushion when attractive growth opportunities surface.These third-party balances grew faster than we expected last quarter as a strong growth of enhanced saving program balances at Raymond James Bank allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet. While this dynamic has negatively impacted the bank segment's NIM because of the geography of the lower-cost sweet balances being swept off balance sheet, it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firm's funding flexibility. Looking forward, we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth.Turning to Slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $708 million, up 91% over the prior year quarter and down 3% compared to the preceding quarter. The sequential decrease in firm-wide net interest income was partially offset by higher RJBDP fees from third-party banks. If you recall, on our last earnings call, we anticipated a 10% decline in these interest-related revenues. So we are pleased with the better-than-expected decline of just 3%, which was partly a function of higher-than-anticipated growth of Enhanced Saving Program balances.The Bank segment's net interest margin decreased 37 basis points sequentially to 3.26% for the quarter, and the average yield of RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 12 basis points to 3.37%. While there are many variables that will impact the actual results, we currently expect combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to be around 5% lower in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fiscal third quarter as we expect some further contraction of the Bank segment net interest income to be partially offset by an increase in RJBDP fees from third-party banks.As we have always said, instead of concentrating on maximizing NIM over the near term, we are more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income and RJBDP fees over the long term, which we believe we are well positioned to do.Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13. Compensation expense was $1.85 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.7%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 62.7% during the quarter, which we are very pleased with, especially given the challenging environment for capital markets. Non-compensation expenses of $570 million, increased 15% sequentially. As Paul mentioned earlier, the quarter included elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and a bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million. The $65 million of provisions for legal and regulatory matters was made up of several items that all hit this quarter. Some of those items were closed out and publicly disclosed and some of the other items are still in process, and we, therefore, will not be able to provide much more detail on those in this call.Additionally, this quarter included seasonally higher conference and event-related expenses. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $54 million, increased $26 million over the preceding quarter, largely reflecting weaker assumptions for commercial real estate valuations in the Moody's CRE price index and in particular, the office price index, which resulted in higher allowances.I'll discuss more related to the credit quality in the Bank segment shortly. In summary, while there has been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory matters over the past 2 quarters, none of the other noncompensation expenses are coming in too much differently than we expected when we last provided guidance for the fiscal year. But as you all know, legal and regulatory expenses and provisions for loan losses using the CECL methodology are inherently difficult to predict.Importantly, we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth in ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients. Slide 14 shows the pretax margin trend over the past 5 quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pretax margin of 16.7% and an adjusted pretax margin of 18.1%, a strong result, given the industry-wide challenges impacting capital markets and the aforementioned provisions.On Slide 15, at quarter end, total assets were $78 billion, a 2% sequential decrease, largely reflecting lower client cash balances in CIP during the quarter. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target.The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.4% and total capital ratio of 22% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized. The 11.4% Tier 1 leverage ratio reflects over $1 billion of excess capital above our conservative 10% target, which would still be 2x the regulatory requirement to be well capitalized. Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. We also have significant sources of contingent funding. We have a $750 million revolving credit facility, which was recently renewed and upsized in April, and nearly $10 billion of FHLB capacity in the Bank segment.Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past 5 quarters. During the fiscal third quarter, the firm repurchased 3.31 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of nearly $91 per share. As of July 26, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. And we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases as we have discussed previously.Lastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter to just 0.94%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just 1.04%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.9% at the quarter end.We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints, higher interest rates and the potential recession on the corporate loan portfolio. As we have done from time to time when we believe there's an attractive risk reward, during the quarter, we proactively sold approximately $450 million of corporate loans at an average price of around 98% of par value.There continues to be a lot of attention in the commercial real estate across the industry, given the challenges with property values and interest rates. So let me briefly cover our portfolio. Across the Bank segment, we have CRE and REIT loans of approximately $8.8 billion, which represents 20% of total loans. Our office portfolio is $1.4 billion, only representing approximately 3% of the Bank segment's total loans.Overall, we have deliberately limited the exposure to office real estate, and we underwrote office loans with what we believe were conservative criteria, but we will continue to monitor each loan closely given the industry-wide challenges. Now I will turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?Paul Christopher ReillyThank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023 and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a challenging environment. And while there is still a near-term economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses.In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the 5% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. And I'm optimistic over the long term, we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology and product solutions.In the Capital Markets segment, there are some signs of improvement in Investment Banking, and we continue to have a healthy M&amp;A pipeline and good engagement levels. But while there is reason for optimism, we expect the pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions and would more likely pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.In the Fixed Income space, depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize, we could start to see an improvement. So while there are some near-term challenges over the long term, we believe the capital markets business is well positioned for growth given the investments we've made over the last 5 years and have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.We will continue to prudently manage expenses in these businesses as near-term revenues continue to come under pressure. Obviously, we'll have to take more significant action if the industry headwinds proved to be more long term.In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter up 3% compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive throughout the quarter. We remain confident that strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.In addition, we expect Raymond James investment management to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution and operational and marketing synergies. In the Bank segment, our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand.We have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate and expect demand for those loans to essentially recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates. With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been tepid. However, we believe the yield environment has improved with ample cash sitting with third-party banks and lots of capital, we are well positioned to lend once activity picks up.In closing, we have strong prospects for future growth given our strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and our ample capital and liquidity. I want to take this time to thank our advisers and associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day, especially in these uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most.Thank you all for what you do. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for questions?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.Michael Anthony AnagnostakisPaul and Paul, it's Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven here. I just starting one off on maybe the balance sheet reinvestment strategy here, you highlighted potentially capitalizing on some of the yield opportunities in loans down the road. But given improved -- improving sorting picture, the funding capacity you have on the off-balance sheet cash and the fact that we're near peak rates is adding duration to lock in some higher yields here, something that you're considering more actively?Paul Christopher ReillyI think you've known us long enough that we don't play the betting on interest rate game. So we like a floating rate balance sheet that served us well, even though maybe for a couple of years, we got criticized, but made it kind of easy to get through this last year.And we certainly have some duration in our balance sheet and bank in terms of mortgages and other things. But again, we're not looking at trying to make an interest rate that overall.Michael Anthony AnagnostakisOkay. That's helpful. And for my follow-up, maybe switching to the capital market side. We're hearing a lot of your peers highlight green shoots as well as the potential recovery in DCM and ECM. But capital raising activities at Ray James was relatively weaker during the quarter. Is that just a function of the mix? Or were there other factors at play?I know you said you expect better results in 2024, but how should we be thinking about the outlook for that business relative to what your peers have been highlighting?Paul Christopher ReillyI think we've all been in the same boat. I mean we've had -- the mix of our businesses are different, so the timing of quarters, but we've already had a number of transactions closed for this quarter. But we see green shoots in that both activity level, backlog, new deals in all positive factors. But we just don't see a big rush to get everything done.So although we expect the business to improve our history and our cycles just tell us that they take a little longer than we would all like or a lot of what bankers expected. So I think we're going to all track along in the industry on this. Hopefully, it improves, we'll play along. We're positioned. We have a lot of clients interested a lot of mandates. But for them to -- we've had those for the last year. So the question is when are people really able to transact in the market?I did want to add something to your first question on banking, although we don't make duration plays, we are seeing spreads widening loans, and we think there's an opportunity, again, by keeping our capital and cash that at the right time and the right loans, we'll be able to grow more on spread and making interest rate bets strategy.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW.Kyle Kenneth VoigtMaybe first question on cash and ESP balances. With now having built back to over $16 billion of third-party deposits and noted in your prepared remarks that you have adequate liquidity for growing the balance sheet, do you anticipate taking any steps near term? Or have you already taken any steps yet to reduce some of the incentives in place to grow those ESP balances much further from current levels?Paul M. ShoukryKyle, no. We really -- again, the ESP program is a product that we created to serve clients and to help advisers bring in assets from their clients. And so really, what's driving our growth strategy with ESP is, first and foremost, client demand and advisers are asking us to keep this product available for their clients.And of course, there's some capacity constraints given we offer up to $50 million of FDIC insurance. So there's a network of banks and there's capacity constraints associated with that. But we're not looking to sort of manage those balances down based on our near-term needs. Long term, we know we're confident we'll need the funding. And so this gives us ample opportunity to grow the balance sheet when client demand for loans resurfaces.Paul Christopher ReillyAnd it's an easy adjustment for us, too, because you can adjust rate, which gives you some attrition and you can stop the program if you had to or slow it down. So -- but as right now, cash sorting has slowed, but it hasn't stopped. If you look at everyone's reports, we will continue to lead the program open to our advisers as long as we have capacity.Kyle Kenneth VoigtUnderstood. And then for my follow-up, I was hoping we could dig into SBL demand a little bit. During the Investor Day, it seemed like you were hopeful that we're nearing a point where SBL demand was starting to come back, and it looks like balances remained flat quarter-on-quarter after a few quarters of declining.So first, just wondering if you believe those balances have finally troughed. And then given the recent equity market resurgence here, is that having any incremental impact on kind of client willingness to borrow against securities? So just if you talk about SBL demand overall, and then any leading indicators, I guess, you might be seeing on the SBL demand side?Paul M. ShoukryYes. I think we have certainly seen a deceleration of paydowns, which is what really picked up as rates increased and borrowing cost increased. We saw the expected paydowns over the last 6 to 12 months. It's kind of particularly in June and even in July, those paydowns have really slowed down. And so we think this is a good baseline. We're not smart enough to call a trough or a floor, But we do -- we are optimistic that over the next 6 to 12 months, if the markets stay relatively resilient, that we'll see kind of a pickup of demand off this level -- of these sort of levels going forward.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.Alexander BlosteinPaul, I want to go back to your guidance on cash revenue, so down 5% from this quarter. At the same time, cash balances seem to be stabilizing. As you pointed out, the sorting has been slowing down. We got another rate hike here today. So I'm just trying to understand the assumptions behind this guidance. And as part of that, can you give us an update on RJBDP balances at the bank as well as at third-party banks?Paul M. ShoukryYes. So a lot of pieces to that question, Alex. But hopefully, 5% is a conservative guide. Last quarter, we guided down 10%, and it actually ended up being down 3%. So we were very pleased to outperform our guide from last quarter. Just given the uncertainty, we think it's always prudent to give conservative guidance around these type of things.So you're right, there are a lot of puts and takes. We would expect the BDP fee portion to be up just because balances are up so significantly quarter-over-quarter. So as long as that stays somewhat resilient over the course of the quarter, we would expect those BDP fees to be up. And then conversely, with the interest income at the bank, we would expect pressure there just because we'll have a full quarter impact of all of the ESP balances that we raised during the third quarter.And as we raise those balances, we moved to lower cost balances from the bank to the third-party banks. So there's some geography involved in that from one to the other. But when we put those things together and our best guess that balances going forward, which can change dramatically over the next couple of months, that's where we come up with the down 5% between both BDP fees and NII.But again, we're hoping that we can exceed that guidance if things hold. And in terms of what we're seeing so far in the month of July, really the balances have stabilized. I mean we did see a decrease in the sweep balances due to the quarterly fee billings in July, which is what you would expect. But outside of that, we really have seen kind of sort of -- absolutely a deceleration of cash sorting activity.I mean outside of those declines from the quarterly fee billings, cash, the sweep balances were fairly stable outside of those quarterly fee billings, and the ESP balances continue to grow.Alexander BlosteinOkay. That makes more sense. Second question to Paul Senior on Investment Banking, I guess. So I hear your comments around the pipeline is getting better. And it sounds like you guys are hopeful that in 6 to 12 months, our revenue will sort of come back up here. So are you effectively implying that Investment Banking revenues will be in this kind of $150-ish million range for the next couple of quarters?And then if that's the scenario, are there -- is there room to more aggressively manage the expense base to bring that business to profitability or breakeven even in that sort of scenario where you really need to see a much better revenue picture to become profitable in capital markets?Paul Christopher ReillyWell, I actually got us both pretty well there. You're calling me old and Paul. I think that it's really hard to tell. I -- if you look at backlog and things, you could say it will start improving. But I think until the market really goes, you'll see it with everybody. So I don't know what our position would be that would make it a lot different in the market when it returns.So we do have a lot more capacity. We invested -- a lot of those investments are with people that we recruited and did acquisitions and they kind of -- they're part of us now. So yes, we've already looked -- we've trimmed some costs, and we think it will continue longer term. We would do more, but we're really trying to keep the team in place that we spent 5 years in building. I think they'll be very, very productive.So hopefully, that everyone's green shoots turns into trees, and as we're hoping for, I think Paul gave 6 to 12 months before we think industry wide, not just us, it will really start hitting. But that's the unknown. It really just is the unknown, right? We certainly have the capacity. And once the market picks up, I think, we're well positioned. Clients are engaged. But that's the million-dollar question, we can't answer.But if we ever got to the point we thought it was more of a permanent or longer term kind of how just we would manage costs as tightly as we could.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.Brennan HawkenSo I know, Paul, that you have -- I won't go into junior or senior. Paul -- CFO, Paul, you commented that you were limited in what you could say on the legal charges was totally understandable, not all resolved. But now this is the second quarter in a row, we've had some legal charges. And is it right to assume we're probably going to see a third quarter because you said they're not all resolved? And so therefore, should we expect some bleed into next quarter? How should we think about that?Paul M. ShoukryYes. I mean there could be certainly additional reserves, and there probably will be additional reserves in future quarters, but we're hoping that there'll be a pretty big drop off from the $66-or-so million that we saw this quarter. That was obviously unusual for us if you look back at our history. So time will tell.But it was obviously -- this quarter was obviously elevated relative to sort of what you look at for an reserve for a quarter for us.Brennan HawkenOkay. Fair enough. And then wondering if you could give a little bit of color around the ending of the relationship with the independent contractor that you spoke about that impacted the NNA this quarter. What kind of counterparty was that? And what led to the decision by either them or you to go in a different direction?Paul Christopher ReillyYes. I think you know we're not going to talk about firms or stuff. But I think that just based on our strategy, it was an independent contractor firm, a normal independent contractor firm. Based on their strategy and what they wanted to do in ours and in us looking at our profitability and I think what they thought they could do in other things, we just thought it would be better to have another home, and they went ahead, and we supported their move.And we -- again, as we said, we kept a lot of the advisers, and the advisers had a choice. And so I would call it just strategic differences in both of our businesses. Profitability, as we said, we don't think that there's a negative impact to our profitability on that change. So we're both making our bets and both going in the directions we think we're right.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.James Francis MitchellPaul, just maybe can you talk a little bit about -- can you speak to the maturity profile of the AFS book? It's still yielding around 2 -- a little over 2%. So just great to get your thoughts on how quickly that portfolio runs off and you get a chance to reinvest that at higher rates?Paul M. ShoukryYes. And we -- I mean, the average maturity on that portfolio is somewhere in the 4-year range. And so it takes some time for it to run off. We're probably going to see maybe $1.5 billion or so of runoff a year at current level. So it will take some time.And frankly, we grew that securities portfolio over -- during that COVID period because we had a pretty significant increase in client cash balances, as you recall. And there really wasn't demand from third-party banks. So we took it on to our own balance sheet to accommodate those cash balances. Unfortunately, we kept the vast majority of those, as Paul indicated, and very, very short-term treasuries and didn't take too much duration risk.And so now as we look forward, we're really going to grow that or let that securities portfolio run off so the liquidity in the balance sheet should be somewhere around 10% of the bank's balance sheets combined, which will let us reinvest a lot of those repayments to bank loans, which, again, as Paul said, have higher spreads and higher yields on them. So that will be a nice kind of tailwind for us over the next several years, hopefully.James Francis MitchellRight. And then when you just think about NII after this coming quarter down, I guess, combined down 5%, maybe NII down a little more, how do you think about -- do you feel like once you kind of catch up in ESP balances or not growing as rapidly that, that NIM starts -- and the bank starts to stabilize and NIIs can be flat to up? Or you still think that further declines?Paul M. ShoukryJust to be clear, when we raise those ESP balances, cash is fungible. The cash that we move off balance sheet to third-party banks is still making a higher spread than the cost of ESP balances while we sort of await investment in higher-yielding assets and loans. So it's still not a huge net positive, but it's still a net positive for us.So we offer the clients a product that's attractive, it allows advisers to gain more wallet share from their clients. And we essentially place that cash with third-party banks until we have better investment opportunities. There's a lot of geography involved in terms of what shows up in NII and BDP fees, but we obviously look at it from a consolidated basis. So it's really a win for the clients, a win for the advisers and a win for the firm and gives us a lot of capacity to grow the balance sheet over time.So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And to the extent that we can -- when demand returns for loans, both corporate loans and then loans to the Private Client Group clients, then there'll certainly be a nice tailwind to our net interest income.Paul Christopher ReillyI think if you look industry wide, there's still a competition for cash. And as long as there is in an upward in the Fed's raising rates, it's going to impact, I think, rates on both ends. And until that dynamics -- once that dynamic stabilizes or if it ever does go the other way, which some people predict, we haven't believed the forward curve for over a year now.But once that does happen, spreads should improve, but that's -- we don't know. So we're operating. We know on the ESP balances. They're not cheap, but we still make it spread off of them. So it's positive to NII, and so there's no harm in raising them for clients and we make a little money too. So...Paul M. ShoukryAnd just to be clear, one last comment on this is because I've got some questions over the e-mail is we are guide -- the 5% guide that I provided on NII and BDP fees is really based on today's rate action. So we're not trying to factor in the forward curve or anything like that. As Paul said, I'm not sure we totally buy the forward curve. I'm not sure if we're certainly not going to give guidance based on the Fed cutting rates anytime soon.Operator(Operator Instructions) And the next question comes from line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.Michael J. CyprysI was hoping you might be able to provide some color on the marketplace for recruiting advisers today, how you see that evolving and how you might characterize the pipeline?Paul Christopher ReillyYes. So I think we -- I think I've gotten this question almost every quarter now for 13 years since I've been CEO. It's competitive. I mean it's -- I think all firms are kind of in the market. The costs have gone up somewhat certainly over the years. So we have maintained our position not being the highest bidder in these cases and using it as positive selection, but it's certainly competitive.You have the broker-dealer employee channels, you have the independent firms and the RA aggregators competing, especially at the high end for all big clients. So the good news for us is we continue to compete very well. We continue, the pipeline is strong. The biggest change probably over the last 2 years is the number of just very large teams that we talk to versus years ago.So -- but the pipeline is great. It's been picking up every quarter. We had a slow start, and it's continued to pick up each quarter. And so we're optimistic, but it is competitive.Michael J. CyprysGreat. Just a follow-up question on the ESP balances. Just curious how you think about the duration of those ESP deposits versus your sweep deposits and other funding sources? And how does that sort of -- how do you take that into consideration when you think about ultimately reinvesting and putting some of those deposits to work?Paul M. ShoukryYes. Well, it's a relatively new product for us. We launched it in March. So we'll learn more as we have more experience with it and as rates stabilize and those sorts of things. So we want their -- we always try to have cushions around kind of how we think about funding deployment and maybe even more so a bigger cushion when you're dealing with a new deposit product in a volatile and uncertain rate environment.And so you look at where we are today, we've had a target of third-party balances of around $10 billion that we talked about just 6 months ago, and now we're up to $16 billion or north of $16 billion of third-party balances. And the banks are still holding very high cash balances more than they need in a normal environment.And so we have a significant funding cushion, an opportunity over the next several months to really kind of have better history and understanding of the sort of the reinvestment of the Enhanced Saving Product balances.Paul Christopher ReillyI think you could also look at most of the ESP balances came from cash balances elsewhere, money markets, treasuries. I mean so it was really -- I think if you look at the assets, the cash yield play, it just happened to be secured with FDIC and more people viewed it as more secure with FDIC insurance. So it's not like it came out of -- everybody ran from equities into the product.So -- and if you look at the percentage of our assets and cash, we're certainly not at -- we're more closer to historic levels than we are at record levels. I mean so -- but as Paul said, we are always more cautious with the new product and understand it can move and also are used to competing. So we will see in the quarter. But again, we have a big cushion right now. That's why we haven't slowed down deposits, just understanding that it could have a little more volatility, but we'll see.OperatorAnd our last question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.Devin Patrick RyanI'll just keep it at one, most was covered here. But I do want to ask about corporate M&amp;A for the firm. And we obviously saw recent press around a reasonably sized public independent broker that could be mulling a sale. And so I thought that was interesting. And so without getting the details around where Raymond James might be interested, specifically, it would be great just to hear about kind of what you guys are seeing in the marketplace?Because it would seem that conditions could be getting better for you guys as well just with valuations, recovering your stocks up as well, confidence is improving in the marketplace to some degree. And we just assume that's a little bit of a better environment for M&amp;A. So I just love to talk about what you guys are seeing in the marketplace today? And if you can, what that pipeline of opportunities is looking like right now relative to, I don't know, a year ago?Paul Christopher ReillyWell, thanks, Devin. As you know, we just hired a new Head of our Corporate Development practice. So we certainly didn't do that to slow down. And I didn't see the article you're alluding to. But we've always have had a course of firms that we believe would fit us well, especially in the Private Client Group space, where we really know them all. And our focus hasn't changed.And as we said the problem most, they're private or not for sale, so it doesn't help, but we stay close. And if it ever changes, we want to be the only or first call. So we continue to keep that strategy. And then on the M&amp;A with Suraj, who's joined us is really focused on also other opportunities. We've looked at M&amp;A firms that we talk to pre-market adjustment.And -- because we thought valuations are way off, and we continue dialogue with those that we think still holds in the practice. And again, pricing has gotten much better there. We've had a few assets in the asset management space and some we've talked to and couldn't come up with pricing versus the market, but it's not unusual for us.And looking at other ancillary technology fit in place like SumRidge, which has really been a huge positive. So our eye is not off the ball at all for M&amp;A. In fact, we always assume the tougher the market, the better opportunity to really add people to the family.So again, it has to be a culture fit, strategic to be able to integrate it and then it's price. So we're pretty price-disciplined too. So we're working away, and we always have. So -- but where we didn't close any for a while, and we closed 3 quickly. So you know who knows.OperatorThere are no further questions. Mr. Reilly, I'll turn the call back to you.Paul Christopher ReillyYes. Thank you for joining. I know it's always a busy time with everyone with earnings, but I really feel like we're in great shape. You can see our asset growth, our recruiting growth and certainly capital markets is a tough market, but that will return to. And we have a great franchise in that business when the market returns, sale return, and we believe we can continue growing the other businesses. So thanks for joining, and we'll talk to you next quarter.OperatorThat does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.]"

PETERSBURG, Fla – Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE: RJF) today reported record net revenues of $2.91 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $369 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023. Excluding $40 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $399 million(3), or $1.85 per diluted share(3).Record quarterly net revenues increased 7% over the prior year’s fiscal third quarter. The benefit of higher short-term interest rates on net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks more than offset declines in investment banking revenues, brokerage revenues, and asset management and related administrative fees. The 1% sequential increase in quarterly net revenues was primarily due to higher asset management and related administrative fees.Story continuesQuarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 23% over the prior year’s fiscal third quarter, driven primarily by higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks which were partially offset by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters. Sequentially, net income available to common shareholders decreased 13%. Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million.For the first nine months of the fiscal year, record net revenues of $8.57 billion increased 5%, record earnings per diluted common share of $5.95 increased 19%, and adjusted earnings per diluted common share of $6.17(3) increased 14% over the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The Private Client Group segment generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income during the first nine months of the fiscal year. Annualized return on common equity was 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22.7%(3).“Through the strength of our businesses and perseverance of our advisors and associates, we generated record net revenues and record net income to common shareholders during the first nine months of the fiscal year, up 5% and 22%, respectively, over fiscal 2022 despite challenging macroeconomic conditions,” said Chair and CEO Paul Reilly. “Importantly, our strong capital ratios and flexible balance sheet keep us well-positioned as we look forward.”Segment ResultsPrivate Client GroupDomestic Private Client Group net new assets(1)(2) of $14.4 billion for the fiscal third quarter, 5.4% annualized growth rate from beginning of period assets Record quarterly net revenues of $2.18 billion, up 11% over the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and 2% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $411 million, up 64% over the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and down 7% compared to the preceding quarterRecord Private Client Group assets under administration of $1.23 trillion, up 15% compared to June 2022 and 5% over March 2023Record Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts of $697.0 billion, up 15% compared to June 2022 and 5% over March 2023Total clients’ domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program (“ESP”) balances of $58.0 billion, down 24% compared to June 2022 and up 11% over March 2023The year-over-year growth in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was driven primarily by increases in RJBDP fees and net interest income, which more than offset market-driven declines in asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 2% driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, which were offset by a decline in RJBDP fees due to lower cash sweep balances, and lower brokerage revenues. However, quarterly pre-tax income declined 7% compared to the preceding quarter driven by higher provisions for legal and regulatory matters and seasonally higher advisor recognition events and conference expenses.Total clients’ domestic cash sweep and ESP balances grew 11% over March 2023. The increase reflects strong growth in ESP balances which more than offset a modest decline in cash sweep balances largely due to quarterly fee billings and income tax payments. Reflecting higher short-term interest rates, the average yield on RJBDP third-party bank balances increased 12 basis points to 3.37% in the fiscal third quarter.“Financial advisor retention and recruiting are strong across our multiple affiliation options driven by our advisor and client-focused culture and leading technology and product solutions,” said Reilly. “For example, our recently-launched Enhanced Savings Program ended the quarter at $11.2 billion, as advisors and their clients continue to value this attractive offering.”Capital MarketsQuarterly net revenues of $276 million, down 28% compared to the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and 9% compared to the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax loss of $34 millionQuarterly investment banking revenues of $141 million, down 35% compared to the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and 3% compared to the preceding quarterThe year-over-year decline in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was largely attributable to lower investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenues. Compensation expense declined 9% driven by lower variable compensation, partially offset by amortization of deferred compensation and additional compensation related to growth investments.“Investment banking activity across the industry remains muted,” said Reilly. “While the investment banking pipeline remains healthy and new business activity is solid, the timing of closings is largely dependent on improving market conditions.”Asset ManagementQuarterly net revenues of $226 million, down 1% compared to the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and up 5% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $89 million, down 4% compared to the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and up 9% over the preceding quarterFinancial assets under management of $200.7 billion, up 10% over June 2022 and 3% over March 2023Financial assets under management of $200.7 billion grew 10% over the prior-year quarter and 3% over the preceding quarter. The increase in financial assets under management was primarily the result of higher equity markets, along with net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group.BankQuarterly net revenues of $514 million, up 86% over the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and down 5% compared to the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $66 million, down 11% compared to the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and 27% compared to the preceding quarterBank segment net interest margin (“NIM”) of 3.26% for the quarter, up 85 basis points over the prior year’s fiscal third quarter and down 37 basis points compared to the preceding quarterNet loans of $43.3 billion, up 4% over June 2022 and down 1% compared to March 2023Quarterly net revenues increased over the prior-year quarter driven by higher asset balances and the favorable impact from higher short-term interest rates. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues declined 5% due to lower net interest income. The Bank segment’s NIM decreased 37 basis points during the quarter to 3.26%, primarily due to increased interest expense from higher-cost funding as ESP balances replaced a portion of lower-cost RJBDP client cash sweep balances. Net loans increased 4% over the prior-year quarter and declined 1% compared to the preceding quarter primarily driven by lower corporate loans. Quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million increased over the preceding quarter primarily due to weaker macroeconomic assumptions for the Moody’s CRE Price Index in the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. Despite a higher provision, the credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid, with criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ending the quarter at 0.94%, down from 1.63% at June 2022 and up slightly from 0.92% at March 2023. Bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans held for investment was 1.04%, and bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.90%.OtherDuring the fiscal third quarter, the firm repurchased 3.31 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of $91 per share. As of July 26, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the Board’s approved common stock repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, the total capital ratio was 22.0%(4) and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.4%(4), both well above regulatory requirements.A conference call to discuss the results will take place today, Wednesday, July 26, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

Carey and American Homes 4 Rent",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-cushman-090000113.html,1690448400,STORY,"['SPG', 'EQR', 'AMH', 'WPC', 'CWK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 27, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. ETFs recently featured in the blog include: Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK, Simon Property Group SPG, Equity Residential EQR, W. P. Carey WPC and American Homes 4 Rent AMH.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 REITs Likely to Beat on Earnings This QuarterThe second-quarter reporting cycle is underway, and investors can be lured by the profits of companies that have already released their quarterly figures. However, rather than adding the stock later to your portfolio, accumulating the ones poised to beat estimates can generate higher gains. This is because an earnings beat usually serves as a catalyst, raising investors’ confidence in the stock and resulting in price appreciation. This is likely to be reflected in the earnings releases of Simon Property Group, Equity Residential, W. P. Carey and American Homes 4 Rent.Moreover, rather than fretting too much about the Fed's rate hikes, focusing on REITs will be a smart move. This is because with the industry offering the real estate structure for several economic activities, be it real or virtual, there are pockets of strength even in a challenging environment.For example, for REITs dealing with industrial real estate, we note that the U.S. industrial real estate sector, while exhibiting signs of normalization following the extraordinary demand spike during the pandemic, continues to project healthy fundamentals. Per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report, net absorption for the second quarter measuring 44.9 million square feet (msf) marks a drop from the heights of the previous year. However, it is still in line with healthy pre-pandemic absorption levels. Leasing activity too mirrors this trend amid economic challenges. While the gross new leasing of 141.1 msf is down 8.9% from the first quarter, it is still in line with the quarterly average experienced from 2015 to 2019.Story continuesThe second quarter saw a swift influx of new industrial supply, with a staggering 139.5 msf of new developments reaching completion. Amid this, the national vacancy rate increased by 60 basis points to 4.1%, surpassing the 4% mark for the first time since mid-2021. Despite the rise, the vacancy rate remains well below the 10-year average, suggesting a resilient market. Yet, despite softening market conditions, rents continued to rise. Second-quarter asking rental rates increased by 4.6% quarter over quarter, pushing the figure to $9.59 per square foot (psf).In the case of the retail REITs, we note that according to a CWK report, the U.S. retail real estate market has continued to exhibit remarkable strength in the second quarter of 2023 despite uncertainties in the economic outlook and notable bankruptcies. The second quarter of 2023 witnessed a ninth consecutive quarter of positive net absorption in the retail market, totaling 7.1 msf nationally. The pace of absorption accelerated significantly compared to the first quarter, coming close to the average rate of the past year. New retail construction has remained subdued in the second quarter of 2023, with only 2 msf of space delivered nationwide.The vacancy rate has dropped to 5.4% in the second quarter, down 60 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 and 80 basis points lower than the pre-pandemic rate. The limited new supply and robust demand have given landlords significant leverage in the market, leading to an increase in asking rents. On average, nationally, asking rents stood at $23.47 psf in the second quarter, representing a 4.7% year-over-year increase from the previous year.Moreover, despite cooling rent growth, apartment demand is showing signs of a solid rebound, with net absorption in the second quarter of 2023 nearing surging new supply levels. This stabilizes occupancy rates after a steep decline in 2022. Per RealPage data, in the second quarter, net demand registered at 83,449 units, and this marked a five-quarter high. While this is still below the record numbers seen during the 2021 boom, it indicates a normalization of apartment demand. This demand rebound coincides with a 50-year high in apartment construction starting to convert into peak completions, with more than 107,000 units completed in the second quarter of this year itself.However, despite the supply surge, this solid demand is aiding in the mitigation of vacancy spikes in most markets, with U.S. apartment occupancy coming at 94.7% as of June, marking only a 0.1 percentage point decline since January. It marks a notable improvement compared to the occupancy fall of 1.2 percentage points in the first half of 2022 and then an additional 1.4 percentage points in the second half of the year. However, rent growth remains below normal in 2023, with year-over-year effective asking rent growth at just 1.5%. This is due to apartment operators prioritizing occupancy rates over rents, leading to more options for renters and putting downward pressure on rent growth.The Zacks MethodologyPicking the right stock could be difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of the Zacks Rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.Here are four REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive surprises this season. Also, diversification benefits offered by real estate make these prudent investment choices now.Simon Property Group currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.42% for the quarter under review. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same in the remaining period, the average beat being 0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In the second quarter, Simon Property is expected to have benefited from its portfolio of premium assets located in some of the key markets globally. Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well. Particularly, healthy retail demand is likely to have aided leasing activity and occupancy levels. Also, SPG is expected to have enjoyed a healthy balance-sheet position.Simon Property Group is scheduled to announce second-quarter figures on Aug 2 after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 billion for quarterly revenues suggests a 3.64% increase year over year.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amid the rebound in apartment demand, Equity Residential’s quarterly performance is likely to have been supported by its portfolio diversification efforts in the urban and suburban markets. It has a healthy balance sheet and banks on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive growth.Per Equity Residential’s May Investor Update presentation, leasing spreads, both for new leases and renewals, have been increasing up until May, setting the stage for a healthy summer leasing season. The blended rate has been showing improvement, with New York showing particularly strong momentum. Furthermore, Bad Debt, Net, has meaningfully improved beyond expectations due to an improvement in delinquency and an increase in move-outs from residents with high delinquent balances.Equity Residential is set to release earnings results on Jul 27 after market close.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s quarterly revenues stands at $715.13 million, indicating a 4.09% increase year over year.

This compares to FFO of $0.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 77.78%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.09 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.15, delivering a surprise of 66.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Veris , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry, posted revenues of $68.73 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.58%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $79.83 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Veris shares have added about 2.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19%.What's Next for Veris?While Veris has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Veris: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.10 on $65.05 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.42 on $260.58 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Residential is currently in the top 47% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Equity Residential (EQR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on July 27.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Equity Residential's revenues are expected to be $715.13 million, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

48,b15905c0-3606-35bf-b0f7-0e26d14f6243,EQR,2023-07-27,4 REITS Likely to Turn Out Winners This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reits-likely-turn-winners-144900840.html,1690382940,STORY,"['WPC', 'EQR', 'SPG', 'AMH']","[The second-quarter reporting cycle is underway, and investors can be lured by the profits of companies that have already released their quarterly figures. However, rather than adding the stock later to your portfolio, accumulating the ones poised to beat estimates can generate higher gains. This is because an earnings beat usually serves as a catalyst, raising investors’ confidence in the stock and resulting in price appreciation. This is likely to be reflected in the earnings releases of Simon Property Group SPG, Equity Residential EQR, W. P. Carey WPC and American Homes 4 Rent AMH.Moreover, rather than fretting too much about Fed’s impending decision on rate hikes, focusing on REITs will be a smart move. This is because with the industry offering the real estate structure for several economic activities, be it real or virtual, there are pockets of strength even in a challenging environment.For example, for REITs dealing with industrial real estate, we note that the U.S. industrial real estate sector, while exhibiting signs of normalization following the extraordinary demand spike during the pandemic, continues to project healthy fundamentals. Per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, net absorption for the second quarter measuring 44.9 million square feet (msf) marks a drop from the heights of the previous year. However, it is still in line with healthy pre-pandemic absorption levels. Leasing activity too mirrors this trend amid economic challenges. While the gross new leasing of 141.1 msf is down 8.9% from the first quarter, it is still in line with the quarterly average experienced from 2015 to 2019.The second quarter saw a swift influx of new industrial supply, with a staggering 139.5 msf of new developments reaching completion. Amid this, the national vacancy rate increased by 60 basis points to 4.1%, surpassing the 4% mark for the first time since mid-2021. Despite the rise, the vacancy rate remains well below the 10-year average, suggesting a resilient market. Yet, despite softening market conditions, rents continued to rise. Second-quarter asking rental rates increased by 4.6% quarter over quarter, pushing the figure to $9.59 per square foot (psf).In the case of the retail REITs, we note that according to a CWK report, the U.S. retail real estate market has continued to exhibit remarkable strength in the second quarter of 2023 despite uncertainties in the economic outlook and notable bankruptcies. The second quarter of 2023 witnessed a ninth consecutive quarter of positive net absorption in the retail market, totaling 7.1 msf nationally. The pace of absorption accelerated significantly compared to the first quarter, coming close to the average rate of the past year. New retail construction has remained subdued in the second quarter of 2023, with only 2 msf of space delivered nationwide.The vacancy rate has dropped to 5.4% in the second quarter, down 60 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 and 80 basis points lower than the pre-pandemic rate. The limited new supply and robust demand have given landlords significant leverage in the market, leading to an increase in asking rents. On average, nationally, asking rents stood at $23.47 psf in the second quarter, representing a 4.7% year-over-year increase from the previous year.Moreover, despite cooling rent growth, apartment demand is showing signs of a solid rebound, with net absorption in the second quarter of 2023 nearing surging new supply levels. This stabilizes occupancy rates after a steep decline in 2022. Per RealPage data, in the second quarter, net demand registered at 83,449 units, and this marked a five-quarter high. While this is still below the record numbers seen during the 2021 boom, it indicates a normalization of apartment demand. This demand rebound coincides with a 50-year high in apartment construction starting to convert into peak completions, with more than 107,000 units completed in the second quarter of this year itself.However, despite the supply surge, this solid demand is aiding in the mitigation of vacancy spikes in most markets, with U.S. apartment occupancy coming at 94.7% as of June, marking only a 0.1 percentage point decline since January. It marks a notable improvement compared to the occupancy fall of 1.2 percentage points in the first half of 2022 and then an additional 1.4 percentage points in the second half of the year. However, rent growth remains below normal in 2023, with year-over-year effective asking rent growth at just 1.5%. This is due to apartment operators prioritizing occupancy rates over rents, leading to more options for renters and putting downward pressure on rent growth.Story continuesThe Zacks MethodologyPicking the right stock could be difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of the Zacks Rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.Here are four REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive surprises this season. Also, diversification benefits offered by real estate make these prudent investment choices now.Simon Property Group currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.42% for the quarter under review. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same in the remaining period, the average beat being 0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In the second quarter, Simon Property is expected to have benefited from its portfolio of premium assets located in some of the key markets globally. Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well. Particularly, healthy retail demand is likely to have aided leasing activity and occupancy levels. Also, SPG is expected to have enjoyed a healthy balance-sheet position.Simon Property Group is scheduled to announce second-quarter figures on Aug 2 after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 billion for quarterly revenues suggests a 3.64% increase year over year.

It has a healthy balance sheet and banks on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive growth.Per Equity Residential’s May Investor Update presentation, leasing spreads, both for new leases and renewals, have been increasing up until May, setting the stage for a healthy summer leasing season. The blended rate has been showing improvement, with New York showing particularly strong momentum. Furthermore, Bad Debt, Net, has meaningfully improved beyond expectations due to an improvement in delinquency and an increase in move-outs from residents with high delinquent balances.Equity Residential is set to release earnings results on Jul 27 after market close.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s quarterly revenues stands at $715.13 million, indicating a 4.09% increase year over year.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis water and wastewater treatment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +28.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, up 22.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.45% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xylem?For Xylem, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xylem will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xylem would post earnings of $0.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72, delivering a surprise of +16.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xylem doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +0.8%.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 30.2%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at 27 cents. In the prior-year quarter, NCLH reported a loss per share of $1.14.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $2,178 million.

Price and EPS SurpriseNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Quote Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors at PlayNorwegian Cruise’s second-quarter top line is expected to have increased year over year on the back of strong booking activities, occupancy improvements and fleet-expansion efforts. Strength in onboard revenue generation (driven by enhancements in bundled offerings), solid advance ticket sales and elevated pricing levels are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues is currently pegged at $1,570 million and $622 million compared with $794 million and $393 million, respectively, reported in the prior-year quarter.For second-quarter 2023, our model predicts passenger ticket and onboard and other revenues to increase 117.5% (to $1,726.7 million) and 2% ($401.3 million), respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and rationalization of product delivery are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the second quarter. The company anticipates second-quarter net yields to rise 2-2.8% (on a reported basis) and 2.5-3.3% (constant-currency basis) from 2019 levels. The company anticipates adjusted EBITDA at approximately $485 million. It expects adjusted EPS to be nearly 25 cents.Elevated costs concerning food, perishables and logistics are likely to have hurt margins in the second quarter. During the quarter, the company anticipates Net Cruise Cost (excluding Fuel per Capacity Day) to be approximately $159 million. Per our model, total cruise operating costs in the second quarter is expected to rise 18.3% year over year to $1,269.3 million.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Norwegian Cruise this time around.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Carnival Corporation &amp; plc CCL, MGM Resorts International MGM and LiveOne, Inc. LVO.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:The Trade Desk is an advertising technology company that has experienced explosive growth over the last several years, and thanks to emerging trends in digital advertising is expected to continue to grow at a compelling rate. Not only is TTD projecting strong sales and earnings growth in the coming years, but has also received earnings estimate upgrades recently, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, and improving near-term expected returns.The Trade Desk specializes in advertising technology solutions. It provides a self-service platform that enables advertisers and agencies to buy digital advertising campaigns across various channels and formats. The Trade Desk's platform utilizes data-driven insights, real-time bidding, and advanced targeting capabilities, empowering advertisers to reach their target audiences more effectively and optimize their advertising campaigns for better results.Similar to how most stock trades today are executed by machines, advertising transactions are moving towards this algorithmic process as well. Because of the shifting trends in ways people consume content online, and the fragmented nature of it, marketers have had to find innovative new ways to communicate with customers. The Trade Desk and its platform has become a mission critical tool for savvy new marketers to take advantage of the opportunities across the spectrum of digital platforms.Because of its advantageous position in the industry, at the crossroads of the digital revolution, and online marketing, TTD has grown at a preposterous pace. Since it’s IPO in 2016, TTD stock has compounded at an annual rate of 65%, returning 2,900% over that period. Fortunately for investors, it probably isn’t too late to get involved, as The Trade Desk and algorithmic marketing industry are still in their early innings.Story continuesElite Sales and Earnings GrowthAlong with its top Zacks Rank, The Trade Desk boasts enviable sales and earnings growth estimates. Current quarter earnings are projected to climb 30% YoY, while sales are expected to grow 20% YoY during the same period. Over the next 3-5 years EPS are forecast to grow 24% annually, a phenomenal figure by any measure and demonstrating the incredible potential for the industry.TTD has also made it a priority to increase its Free Cash Flow over the last couple of years, which reached $500 million in the trailing twelve months. This abundance of cash allows management considerable flexibility, allowing them financial breathing room while also enabling them to reinvest in the highest leverage areas of the business.Huge Tailwinds in Connected TVAt The Trade Desk, Connected TV (CTV) is currently the largest and fastest growing business segment and will be for the foreseeable future. Connected TV is rapidly becoming one of the most critical channels for advertisers to reach customers as time spent watching tv and streaming continues to grow.When you consider that 87% of US households have a CTV and 46% watch video via a connected TV daily, you can begin to understand the scope of TTD’s opportunity. Additionally, The Trade Desk platform has been used to reach 90 million households on 120 million devices.While the streaming wars have made the competition for eyeballs fierce, TTD sits in an exceptional position to benefit. As a sort of ‘pick and shovel’ resource, TTD’s platform is set to benefit from the continued growth of streaming applications and usage.The Trade Desk has long anticipated this exponential rise in CTV usage and advertising, and has positioned itself accordingly. By utilizing complex computing and AI, TTD can connect advertisers with their target market through highly targeted campaigns.Bottom LineThe Trade Desk is an extremely well positioned company, with numerous secular tailwinds at its back. In addition to the points addressed above, TTD has also only just begun to branch out into international business opportunities, which will truly take it to the next level.TTD currently has a premium valuation, trading at 22x one year forward sales, which is above the industry average of 5.1x and above its five-year median of 17.3x. However, because of its special business positioning and immense growth, investors will rarely get an opportunity to buy TTD at a traditionally deep discount.Bear of the Day:There is a storm brewing in the commercial real estate industry, and it is looking especially bad in the office building sector.Commercial real estate loans are facing an increase in new delinquencies, primarily driven by offices, which account for 80% of these defaults. Major cities are witnessing a continuous struggle with occupancy rates, languishing at approximately 50% of capacity.Piedmont Office Realty Trust, an office REIT focused on class A buildings in major US markets, has been on a steady decline since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak. Marked by falling building occupancy, declining earnings, and analyst downgrades, PDM stock now has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating and should thus be avoided.Steep Earnings DowngradesAnalysts have unanimously revised earnings estimates lower across timeframes for Piedmont Office Realty Trust. Current quarter earnings estimates have been lowered by -4.4% to $0.44 per share and are projected to fall -12% YoY.FY23 earnings estimates have been downgraded by -3.3% and are expected to fall -11% YoY. Additionally, sales growth is expected to stagnate across forecast timeframes. It seems analysts are still expecting the commercial real estate market to continue its ride lower.ValuationThe only semi-bright spot for Piedmont Office Realty Trust is its historically cheap valuation and high dividend yield. PDM is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 4.2x, which is below the industry average of 15.4x, and below its five-year median of 9.1x. Additionally, it currently has a hefty 11.4% dividend yield.However, because of the uncertainty surrounding the commercial real estate market, the future of office work, and the mountain of debt within the industry, a cheap valuation alone is not enough to justify buying the stock.Bottom LineIt should be noted that PDM does indeed have a premium portfolio of assets across important US markets and a fairly stable balance sheet, so should be able to ride out this trying time in the industry. The problem is that there is so much uncertainty surrounding the sector that it is still too risky to try and start fishing for the bottom. Investors would be better off focusing on stocks that are leading the market and have high Zacks Ranks.Additional content:3 Top Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Gain as Inflation EasesRecent reports on inflation suggest that the spike in the prices of indispensable goods and services over the past two years is finally coming down as fuel prices fall.This means consumers are now in a better position to open up their wallets, eventually benefiting consumer discretionary stocks such as Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, MGM Resorts International and LiveOne, Inc.Retail Inflation Cools DownAfter a painful increase in retail inflation, price pressures cooled down to its slowest pace in more than two years in June. The Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 3% year over year last month, less than analysts’ estimate of a rise of 3.1%.The yearly rate of inflation decelerated from May’s increase of 4%, and was also the lowest rate since March 2021. Notably, retail inflation slowed down for 12 successive months. The decline in the cost of airfare and prices of used vehicles were primarily responsible for the slowdown in broader price pressures.Retail inflation more than halved after a sharp rise in energy prices pushed it to a 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022.Wholesale Price Data Indicates Easing Inflationary PressureLast month, the annual increase in producer prices was also the smallest in almost three years, indicating that the economy is now in a disinflation period. The Labor Department added that the producer price index (PPI) increased a meager 0.1% year over year, the smallest annual rise since August 2020.What’s more encouraging, in May, the headline PPI number, in reality, dropped by 0.4%, in contrast to the earlier reported 0.3%. Producer prices are declining as supply-chain bottlenecks fade, and demand for goods takes a beating due to a series of interest rate hikes.Fed’s Favored Inflation Index ModerateThe chosen inflation index of the Federal Reserve too cooled down in May. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, compared to the same period last year, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 3.8% in May, its lowest annual rate in two years, again an indication that inflation is slowing.The decline in energy prices dragged the PCE Index lower in May. Energy prices fell 13.4% in May from a year ago and were down 3.9% from the prior month.Consumer Discretionary Stocks to BenefitWith price pressures weakening, the purchasing power of consumers increases. In other words, consumers are now in a much better position to splurge on nonobligatory items. Therefore, it's prudent for investors to cash on this trend and bet on solid consumer discretionary stocks.We have, thus, selected three consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Such stocks also boast a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Carnival operates as a cruise and vacation company. Carnival has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 51.7% over the past 60 days.

BetMGM has based forward-looking statements on management's current expectations, assumptions and projections about future events and trends. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, BetMGM's expectations regarding its financial outlook (including forecasted net revenues from operations, EBITDA, and amounts expected to be invested by MGM Resorts and Entain in 2023), projected market share position, and its expected growth in new and existing jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Included among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are: the significant competition within the gaming and entertainment industry; BetMGM's ability to execute on its business plan; changes in applicable laws or regulations, particularly with respect to iGaming and online sports betting; BetMGM's ability to manage growth and access the capital needed to support its growth plans; and BetMGM's ability to obtain the required licenses, permits and other approvals necessary to grow in existing and new jurisdictions.

BetMGM believes this presentation, which it uses for its own analysis of operations, is useful in that it reflects the true economic performance of the business. If BetMGM presented net revenue from operations in accordance with GAAP, then BetMGM would present the revenues associated with its Nevada digital and retail sports betting operations differently, until such time as BetMGM is licensed as a Nevada gaming operator. Currently under GAAP, its calculation of Net Revenue would be on a basis net of operating costs, such that the GAAP reported Net Revenue would be lower than the Net Revenue reported herein, with Net Income remaining the same.About BetMGMBetMGM is a market-leading sports betting and gaming entertainment company, pioneering the online gaming industry.

NCLH is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, 2023, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 30.2%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at 27 cents. In the prior-year quarter, NCLH reported a loss per share of $1.14.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $2,178 million. The projection suggests an increase of 83.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS SurpriseNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Quote Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors at PlayNorwegian Cruise’s second-quarter top line is expected to have increased year over year on the back of strong booking activities, occupancy improvements and fleet-expansion efforts. Strength in onboard revenue generation (driven by enhancements in bundled offerings), solid advance ticket sales and elevated pricing levels are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues is currently pegged at $1,570 million and $622 million compared with $794 million and $393 million, respectively, reported in the prior-year quarter.For second-quarter 2023, our model predicts passenger ticket and onboard and other revenues to increase 117.5% (to $1,726.7 million) and 2% ($401.3 million), respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and rationalization of product delivery are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the second quarter. The company anticipates second-quarter net yields to rise 2-2.8% (on a reported basis) and 2.5-3.3% (constant-currency basis) from 2019 levels. The company anticipates adjusted EBITDA at approximately $485 million. It expects adjusted EPS to be nearly 25 cents.Elevated costs concerning food, perishables and logistics are likely to have hurt margins in the second quarter. During the quarter, the company anticipates Net Cruise Cost (excluding Fuel per Capacity Day) to be approximately $159 million. Per our model, total cruise operating costs in the second quarter is expected to rise 18.3% year over year to $1,269.3 million.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Norwegian Cruise this time around.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.30 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on August 1, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.30 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.27 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of 10.43%.NCLH is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure.

59,c6d76e69-e748-317f-b97f-38962cb46e09,NCLH,2023-07-27,Consumer Confidence Rebounds on Cooling Inflation: 5 Winners,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-confidence-rebounds-cooling-inflation-124100224.html,1690375260,STORY,"['RCL', 'MAR', 'OSW', 'NCLH']","[Cooling inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its monetary tightening cycle, which has sent the confidence of Americans soaring. Although fears of the economy slipping into a recession linger, many are now confident that the worst can now be avoided and the economy will soon rebound.This saw consumer confidence jumping further in July. The Conference Board said on Jul 25 that consumer confidence jumped to 117 in July to hit its highest level in two years. The July reading also easily surpassed analysts' expectations of a reading of 112 and was also way above June's revised reading of 110.1.More importantly, consumers' expectations or the Expectations Index, which measures the outlook for business, income and labor market conditions over the upcoming six months, climbed to 88.3 in July from 80 in June. A reading of below 80 indicates a recession in the coming year.Consumer confidence is making a steady and solid rebound as inflation has eased over the past few months and the Fed's aggressive interest rate hike stance finally seems to bear fruit. The Fed increased interest rates, totaling 500 basis points, on 10 straight occasions from March 2021.June’s consumer price index (CPI) reading and retail sales data indicate that consumers continued to spend more than they did a month ago as inflation eased. CPI increased 3% in June after rising 4% in May, to hit its lowest level since March 2021. Retail sales also grew 0.2%, indicating that people are spending more due to cooling commodity prices.The central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged in June for the first time after 15 months but Fed officials are expected to go for a 25-basis point rate hike on Jul 26. Even then, confidence among Americans is high as they believe that this could be the last of the hikes before the Fed ends its current monetary tightening cycle.Moreover, the U.S. labor market is still resilient, adding to household confidence. The economy added 209,000 jobs in June, while annual hourly wages increased 4.4%.Story continuesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in consumer discretionary stocks.Our ChoicesTherefore, from an investment perspective, we have identified five stocks from this sector that are likely to capitalize on the rebound in consumer confidence. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited OSW is a provider and innovator in the fields of wellness, beauty, rejuvenation and transformation on cruise ships and on land.

61,278c9572-bb6b-3951-adf9-caa84f21e692,MET,2023-07-27,Earnings Preview: MetLife (MET) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-metlife-met-q2-140212476.html,1690380132,STORY,"['MET', 'MET-PF', 'PRU']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when MetLife (MET) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5%.Revenues are expected to be $17.19 billion, down 6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MetLife?For MetLife, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MetLife will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MetLife would post earnings of $1.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.52, delivering a surprise of -17.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MetLife doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPrudential (PRU), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.04 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +74.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $12.7 billion, down 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Prudential has been revised 1.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Prudential will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But what about building trust among potential new hires before entering the door?Prospective employees could easily be written off as unworthy of further investment as leaders tighten budgets and try to increase efficiency. But research finds that failing to build trust among job candidates could result in fewer accepted job offers and shorter retention among new hires.A recent survey from management consulting firm Gartner finds that slightly over half (54%) of job candidates say they trust the organizations to which they’re applying to be honest during the hiring process. Even more concerning, 44% of survey respondents say they've accepted a job offer only to change their minds later.Faith in employers is already low among workers who have gone through layoffs and feel they lack job security. “Some research has found that employees who have gone through a layoff are 65% more likely than those who have not been laid off to quit their next job,” according to Gartner. Its data portend these new employees will be an immediate flight risk and look for better or more secure job opportunities after acquiring their new positions.Carmen von Rohr, a senior principal in Gartner’s HR practice and the report's author, advises HR leaders to rethink the candidate experience entirely. That starts with reconsidering who makes first contact with potential job candidates. Gartner finds that potential hires trust hiring managers more than recruiters, primarily when relaying critical information like possible career paths and company culture details.It also finds that early-career employees are more likely to trust an organization when current employees are involved in hiring. “Entry-level candidates are much more likely than their mid or senior-level counterparts to trust other employees most with cultural and diversity information. They are also more likely than other candidates to trust current employees’ answers to questions about work-life balance and the management style of their prospective manager,” von Rohr writes, adding that HR leaders should equip recruiters with the right tools or training to exemplify why top applicants should accept a job offer.Story continuesOtherwise, recruiters can become a “point of risk,” writes von Rohr. “Sixteen percent of candidates who withdrew from a position after accepting an offer say they did so because of a negative interaction with a recruiter.”Amber Burtonamber.burton@fortune.com@amberbburtonThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

""We retain a positive outlook and look for Brent to rise to $85–$90 over the coming months.""Still, oil dropped on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude inventories fell less than expected and the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, leaving the way open for another increase.Risk appetite in wider financial markets is being boosted by growing expectations that central banks such as the Fed are nearing the end of policy tightening campaigns, which would boost the outlook for global growth and energy demand.The U.S. economy grew by a bigger than expected 2.4% last quarter, government data showed Thursday, as labor market resilience supported consumer spending, while businesses boosted investment in equipment, potentially keeping a recession at bay.""With interest rate hikes either at or near a peak amidst increasing views that a recession will be avoided, risk assets such as oil have become increasingly appealing,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois.The European Central Bank raised interest rates for the ninth consecutive time on Thursday.A pledge on Monday from China to boost policy support for the economy has spurred hopes of oil demand regeneration from the world's largest crude importer, Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva said in a note.Coming into focus is an Aug. 4 meeting of OPEC+ ministers to review the market.(Reporting by Laura SanicolaAdditional reporting by Alex Lawler in London, Katya Golubkova in Tokyo and Muyu Xu in SingaporeEditing by David Goodman, David Evans, Barbara Lewis and Diane Craft)]"

The move sparked some profit taking in oil markets, amid concerns that high interest rates will pressure crude demand.But the Fed also signaled that the U.S. may not see a recession this year - a scenario that bodes well for oil demand, especially if local economic activity recovers from recent lulls.This notion, coupled with a drop in the dollar following the Fed decision, helped support oil prices.Brent oil futures rose 0.9% to $83.33 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1% to $79.53 a barrel by 22:07 ET (02:07 GMT). Both contracts were now once again close to three-month highs.Oil buoyed by tighter supply outlookOil prices are expected to increase in the coming months, tracking tightness in global markets following supply cuts by the world’s largest producers.Saudi Arabia and Russia both recently signaled lower production levels for August, with analysts expecting the supply cuts to potentially stretch into end-September.The prospect of weaker supply helped offset a series of soft readings on U.S. inventories, with data on Wednesday showing that U.S. crude stockpiles shrank less than expected in the week to July 21.But U.S. gasoline inventories contracted for a fourth straight week, while gasoline production also weakened more than expected, indicating that fuel demand in the world’s largest oil consumer remained steady.Promises of more stimulus measures in China also buoyed oil prices this week, on hopes that fuel demand in the world’s largest oil importer will recover from COVID-era lows,Story continuesMore rate hike risks on tapBeyond the Fed, focus this week is also on central bank meetings in Europe and Japan.The European Central Bank is widely expected to hike rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, and could signal more rate hikes due to sticky euro zone inflation.The Bank of Japan is expected to keep rates at ultra-low levels.

Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Ines Ferre takes a look at the geopolitical and weather-related pressures that are pushing fuel prices higher.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, let's also take a look at the price at the pump because pain at the pump. Gas prices are on the rise once again. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline climbing to a three-month high, a $3.69 on Wednesday. That's according to the latest data there from AAA. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre is taking a closer look at what we're seeing. Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, Seana. And these higher prices are coming at a bad time when commodity prices are also higher, agricultural commodities like wheat, for example. And this isn't great for the inflation fight, because we know that consumers are already stretched with their dollars. Also when the price of energy just goes up, in general, other things go up as well.So as you mentioned, that national average for gasoline, that's a three-month high. Now, over the last-- since Tuesday, it has gone up $0.05 to $3.69. Diesel also is higher at $3.92 a gallon. Last week, it was at $3.86. You're looking at the Wi-Fi interactive board, so you're seeing gasoline futures that are up.Now what is driving these higher fuel prices? Well, the mounting supply cuts from OPEC and Russia. You've got also some refineries that have not been working because of extreme heat. So just to give you an idea, if you put a refinery offline for about 20 minutes, that can delay days of supplies when it comes to gasoline.Also gasoline inventories, those are already low. But just to put this in perspective, look, last year, you had gasoline averages at $0.64 higher than what they're at today. You had that peak last year of gasoline peaking $5 a gallon.And as far as the agricultural prices are concerned, well, we have seen the commodities going higher because of Russia ending a crucial deal with Ukraine that allowed Ukraine to export wheat. So that has lifted up the price of some agricultural items.Story continuesAnd also, guys, there is an unknown, and that is the hurricane season. We are officially in the hurricane season. It gets more active at the end of the summer, beginning of the fall. So we'll have to see what happens there and how that impacts gasoline prices.SEANA SMITH: Hey, Ines, putting you on the spot just a bit, but how has that typically impacted the price of gasoline? Obviously, I mean, just in terms of if we did see some sort of disruption from these storms, how big of an uptick could we see in prices potentially?INES FERRE: Well, you could see them go higher, because, look, the refineries, I mean, if you hit refineries, if refineries have to go offline, that's significant. And that would impact days of supplies for gasoline. So we've seen that before. We've seen these spikes going higher when we have had hurricanes. And we could see that again for sure.SEANA SMITH: Certainly something that we will continue to watch. All right, Ines Ferr thanks.]"

Panda worked on several notable transactions during his time at Evercore, including Aerojet Rocketdyne's $4.7 billion sale to L3Harris.Panda will join PJT as a partner focused on the aerospace &amp; defense sector, the sources said.Evercore, PJT Partners and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York; Editing by Sonali Paul)]"

78,748123b8-3eb6-33bc-8620-c9bef14605d6,FE,2023-07-27,Earnings Preview: Avista (AVA) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-avista-ava-q2-140242794.html,1690380162,STORY,"['AVA', 'FE']","[Avista (AVA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.3%.Revenues are expected to be $398.2 million, up 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Avista?For Avista, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Avista will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Avista would post earnings of $1.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of -37.07%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Avista doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, FirstEnergy (FE) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -13.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3 billion, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for FirstEnergy has been revised 2.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FirstEnergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Click to skip our detailed analysis of the state of the chatbot market today and jump right to the 10 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots.If you’re looking for some good excuses to get out of work for a week, or even just a day, and your human brain just can’t come up with anything that isn’t totally lame or cliche, perhaps AI is the answer.AI chatbots have exploded into the public consciousness in the last year, driven by the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The renowned chatbot had more than 100 million active users within just two months of its launch and garnered 1.6 billion visits in June 2023 alone. The platform generates well-articulated and informative responses to just about any question posed to it, including believable sick day excuses. We have even used the platform to compile a list of ChatGPT’s top stock picks.Given its controversial ability to generate everything from fake excuses to get out of work (as we’ll see below), to full-blown essays, to staggering misinformation, ChatGPT has been banned by several countries, including Italy, though that particular ban over privacy concerns has since been lifted.While ChatGPT has attracted the lion’s share of public interest, it’s far from the only chatbot. Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN)’s Zendesk Bots, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)’s Einstein, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s Watson Assistant, HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS)’s Chatbot Builder, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Bard, and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Bing Chat are just a few of the other chatbots on the market.Until now, the broader chatbot industry has largely been devoted to customer service applications, allowing websites to handle service requests, inquiries, and sales through an automated platform. The industry is still relatively small in size, at an estimated $5.13 billion in 2022 according to Grand View Research, but it’s expected to grow at an impressive 24% CAGR between 2023 and 2030. Social media chatbots are expected to be a strong growth driver for the industry, with their CAGR projected to be on par with the overall growth of the industry.Story continuesZendesk’s Customer Service BotsZendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN) Bots offers both standard and advanced bots to the company’s customers for implementation into their websites. The company’s advanced bots use AI to accurately recognize support requests and forward them to the proper channels. They also come with pre-trained understanding of customer intents in several industries, including financial services, software, and retail. Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN) was acquired by a group of private equity firms in June 2022 for $10.2 billion after previously turning down a $17 billion takeover offer.Salesforce’s Generative AI for CRMSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)’s Einstein GPT is billed by the company as the world’s first generative AI for CRM applications. The AI platform can generate emails and conversations based on real-time insights culled from customers’ business data, boosting sales and improving the customer experience. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)’s leading AI ecosystem, which also includes Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, helped the company grow revenue by 11% year-over-year to $8.25 billion in the quarter ended April 30. Free cash flow surged by 21% to $4.25 billion.IBM’s Business-Focused AI AssistantInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s Watson Assistant uses deep learning and machine learning in combination with a natural language processing model that allows it to interact with customers in a conversational tone and accurately understand context and intent. The model also has an intelligent search function that can quickly scan documents and websites for the most concise and relevant answers. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s software revenue grew by 7.5% year-over-year during the company’s Q3 2023 period, hitting $5.81 billion and widely topping analysts’ estimates.HubSpot’s Free AI Chatpot ToolsHubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS)’s Chatbot Builder allows customers to choose from a range of chatbot templates or customize their own bot with features like meeting scheduling, leads qualifying, and task automation. The chatbots are fully integrated with HubSpot’s free CRM software, which includes additional features like analytics and email marketing, allowing the bots to be customized with personalized messages that pull information from an information database. HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) grew its first quarter earnings by 122% year-over-year to $1.20, while revenue jumped by 27% to $502 million. HubSpot Chief Executive Yamini Rangan believes generative AI is leading to a massive transformational shift in the market and that the company is well positioned to help customers optimize their operations through AI.Bard Building on Years of Alphabet’s AI ResearchAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Bard is a generative AI chatbot in the vein of ChatGPT that uses a large language model to deliver conversational responses regarding everything from the latest developments surrounding the James Webb Space Telescope to 10 really unusual sick day excuses. Bard is not yet widely available or as popular as ChatGPT. Alphabet has been using AI for years to improve Google’s understanding of language and what the key aspects of a specific search question are so the engine can deliver the most relevant results. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) pulled in $62 billion in revenue in Q2 driven by growth in Search revenue, which has thus far withstood the challenge of AI chatbots.Microsoft’s Browser-Based AI ChatbotMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Bing Chat is another AI chatbot that will be competing with ChatGPT and Bard. Bing Chat has numerous intriguing features that are either already implemented, or are in development. One of them is the chatbot’s ability to summarize long form online content into concise explanations. Another is the ability to compare various products, with the bot even utilizing tables to summarize the pertinent information of each product.The Ithaka Group is bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s position in the generative AI market, having this to say about the company in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds best-in-class platforms and provides services that help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft’s stock appreciated on the back of excitement surrounding the company’s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI.”AI chatbots have rapidly become a great source of random information, providing everything from a list of reasons for leave of absence from work to the most plausible family emergency excuses, and their capabilities are only scratching the surface of what they could eventually become, which has investors and consumers alike excited for the future of chatbots.For now, let’s go ahead and check out the best excuses to get out of work as generated by the current iterations of two specific AI chatbots.Our MethodologyThe 30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots are ranked subjectively based on their plausibility and how applicable they are to the masses.The lists provided by two different AI chatbots were used to compile the ranking, Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and each listing notes which chatbot came up with the idea. In cases where both chatbots had the same idea, we used the one that offered the better supporting reasoning and ways to implement the excuse. The chatbot that came up with the most quality excuses will be crowned the winner at the end of the article.Note that Microsoft’s Bing Chat was also consulted but refused to provide any excuses, making it the least fun chatbot of the three.

If you celebrate a religious holiday that falls on a workday, you may need to take a day off work. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, and your boss should be understanding.Chat Bot: Bard This is a rather weak suggestion, as there would actually have to be a religious holiday taking place on the day in question for this excuse to have any merit, and there are relatively few of those on the calendar.29. Need to buy urgent medication. If you need to buy urgent medication, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention what the medication is for and how long it will take to get it.Chat Bot: Bard If you’re looking for one of the best excuses to get out of work for the day, this probably isn’t it. It would be hard to justify needing an entire day off simply to go buy medication.28. Public Transportation Issues: ""There's a major disruption in public transportation, and I won't be able to reach work on time.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This is a poor excuse for multiple reasons. There would have to be a known issue with local public transportation (such as a workers’ strike) for this to fly, and even then, there are potentially several workarounds (other unaffected transportation options) that should still be able to get you to work.27. Severe Weather: ""Due to inclement weather conditions, it's unsafe for me to commute to work.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This is another excuse that has extremely limited viability, as the weather would actually have to be quite extreme in your area for this to have any merit.26. Legal Obligation: ""I have to appear in court for a legal matter.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This isn’t a terrible excuse on the surface, but it does run the risk of your employer asking into the nature of the legal matter, which they may even be required to do if such a matter is brought to their attention. As such, this excuse is probably too risky to use.25. Interview. If you have a job interview, you may need to take a day off work to attend the interview. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, and your boss should be understanding.Chat Bot: Bard This is another excuse that isn’t terrible in a vacuum, but it would cause your employer to question your loyalty if they believe you to be out looking for other work. If you actually like your job and do intend to keep it for the foreseeable future, you probably don’t want your employer thinking otherwise.24. Travel delays. If your flight or train is delayed, you may need to miss work. You can say that your flight was cancelled, that your train was delayed, or that you're stuck in traffic.Chat Bot: Bard Not one of the best excuses to get out of work as far as a train being delayed or being stuck in traffic goes. Unless you’re claiming the train is delayed by hours or that you’re stuck in the traffic jam of the century, those excuses aren’t going to buy you a day off work. A flight cancellation has more merit if you travel a lot for work, but isn’t going to be viable for the average worker.23. Pregnant sickness. If you're pregnant and experiencing morning sickness or other pregnancy-related nausea, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention how severe the nausea is and how long it's been going on.Chat Bot: Bard If you’re actually a biological female and pregnant, then this is undoubtedly one of the best excuses to get out of work. If you’re neither of those things, which probably applies to 98-99% of the population, then it’s rather useless.22. Volunteer work. If you volunteer for a cause that you care about, you may need to take a day off work to volunteer. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, and your boss should be understanding.Chat Bot: Bard I wouldn’t be so sure about the boss being understanding. Your employer may appreciate that you do volunteer work, but not when it’s conflicting with your non-volunteer, I’m-paying-you-to-be-here work.21. Training. If you need to attend training, you may need to take a day off work. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, but you'll need to make sure that you're able to make up the work.Chat Bot: Bard This could be an alright excuse in the right scenario, depending on what kind of work you do and whether training or certification courses could add valuable new skills to your repertoire. The downside is, your employer would probably want to know the specifics of the training as far as how it relates to your job, and then might expect you to add those tasks to your workload.20. Deadlines. If you have a deadline that you need to meet, you may need to take a day off work to work on it. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, but you'll need to make sure that you're able to meet the deadline.Chat Bot: Bard Decent excuse in the right scenario, though it could also make your employer question your job performance if you’re claiming to be well behind on a project you perhaps shouldn’t be so far behind on.19. Jury Duty: ""I've been summoned for jury duty and have to report to the courthouse.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT It some ways it sounds like one of the most crazy and yet cliché excuses ever, but hey, it’s actually plausible if you live in an area where jury duty is a legal requirement.18. Personal Counseling or Therapy: ""I have a scheduled counseling/therapy session that I can't miss.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This isn’t a bad excuse, whether it would justify a full day off work is the primary question. If you claim the appointment is smack dab in the middle of the day, leaving you only a couple hours to come in on either side of it, it could work.17. Last-minute appointment. If you have a last-minute appointment that you can't reschedule, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention what the appointment is for and how long it will take.Chat Bot: Bard As far as good excuses to get out of things last minute goes, this is one of the safest bets. Your employer may ask for the details and whether or not you can make it in at any point during the day however.16. Muscle problems. If you have muscle problems, such as a pulled muscle or a sprain, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention what happened and how long you need to rest.Chat Bot: Bard This is a pretty solid excuse in that it could be applied to many jobs and probably isn’t going to require any kind of doctor’s note to justify.15. Car problems. If your car breaks down, you may need to miss work to get it fixed. You can say that your car broke down on the way to work, that you had to get it towed, or that you're waiting for a part to be delivered.Chat Bot: Bard Car problems is a relatively standard excuse, but not one of the best excuses to get out of work for the day, as it doesn’t necessarily explain why you can’t still get in to work via public transportation.14. Sleepless Night: ""I had a sleepless night due to unforeseen circumstances and need to rest.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT If you just need sick leave reasons for 1 day, this is a good excuse in the sense that there’s no way to disprove it. Whether or not your employer thinks you should just tough it out and work on little to no sleep anyway is another matter.13. Technology Malfunction: ""My computer crashed, and I won't be able to work remotely.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This is one of best excuses to get out of work if you’re a remote worker and pretty much the standard go-to excuse. However, given the rising work capabilities of smartphones, it’s becoming harder to justify taking a day off work on the basis that your laptop or PC isn’t operational.12. Car Accident: ""I was involved in a minor car accident, and I need to handle the insurance process.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT A decent excuse, though the insurance process doesn’t take very long and the accident would have to have occurred before your shift (on the way to work presumably), potentially leaving plenty of time to still come in to work. You could ask for the day off on the basis of having to also take the car in to a shop to be looked at and/or yourself to a clinic to be examined.11. Moving or Relocation: ""I'm moving to a new residence and need to take care of moving-related tasks.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT Claiming you have a moving day is a decent excuse to get out of work, unless your work has to mail you stuff, in which case it would cause issues. In the second half of this article we’ll check out the ten best excuses to get out of work according to AI and declare which AI chatbot offered better slacker suggestions. Click to continue reading and see the 10 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Free iPhone and iPad Games10 Best Cocktails for People Who Don’t Like Taste of Alcohol35 Best Drama Movies on NetflixDisclosure: None. 30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"
81,423747b5-6aed-3c76-b9a7-1e4ccc752447,FLS,2023-07-27,Investors in Flowserve (NYSE:FLS) have seen notable returns of 34% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-flowserve-nyse-fls-seen-153128619.html,1690385488,STORY,['FLS'],"[Investors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the Flowserve Corporation (NYSE:FLS) share price return of 24% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Some buyers are laughing, though, with an increase of 21% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Flowserve achieved compound earnings per share growth of 6.0% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Flowserve has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Flowserve will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Flowserve's TSR for the last 3 years was 34%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Flowserve has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 24% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 0.5% per year over five years. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Flowserve   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.We will like Flowserve better if we see some big insider buys.

But it's much more complicated than that.SEE® (formerly Sealed Air) protective packaging performance has been at the forefront of the industry since we introduced the world to BUBBLE WRAP® brand cushioning more than 50 years ago. At SEE, product protection always comes first, so when we took to creating paper-based packaging solutions for e-commerce, we knew our customers would expect the best.Curbside RecyclabilityWhether it's paper, plastic, or a combination of the two, SEE takes packaging recyclability claims seriously. Our definition of recyclable means a packaging material or solution must meet all three of the criteria below, before we will label a solution recyclable:Can be collected at a curbside or drop-off by at least 60% of the populationCan be sorted by the material recovery facility (MRF) to which it is sentCan be recycled into a commercially viable productAs it pertains to our innovation portfolio for paper e-commerce mailers, our solutions have met these criteria, which is why we label them ""widely"" or ""curbside"" recyclable. While paper recycling rates remain high around the world, we nonetheless always suggest consumers check and follow local guidelines.Proven PerformanceA critical element of the packaging lifecycle is to ensure the package successfully completes its primary function: product protection. Package or product damage that occurs at any point during transit could result in a return or replacement, at which point all the resources that went into the first product and its transportation are lost, and if replaced, can more than double the sustainability impact of the order.Adding paper options to our portfolio of e-commerce mailers is a great way to improve our customers' sustainability profile-but only if the performance of that packaging measures up. That's why in addition to ensuring our solutions are tested against International Safe Transit Association standards, we also offer packaging design and performance consultations through our network of packaging design application centers.Story continuesAnother way fiber-based mailers add to sustainability benefits is by reducing the package-to-product ratio when compared to a standard box. Research shows e-commerce consumers want a product to occupy at least 75% of a package. Mailers not only help by rightsizing, they're also typically smaller and weigh less than corrugated boxes.Process AutomationDiscrete mailers, such as our traditional paper mailers, the return-ready mailer, and the paper bubble mailer are filled, sealed, and labeled manually. But in larger operations, where speed and efficiency are more critical, our AUTOBAG® brand automated bagging and printing systems have helped e-commerce and D2C retailers fulfill high volumes of orders quickly, including custom printing and labeling.Automated bagging and printing systems were originally designed for rolls of poly film or poly-coated paper to ensure the material ran smoothly through the system. But now-with the driving force to bring sustainability and efficiency together-SEE introduces the new AUTOBAG® brand 850S that runs paper material specifically designed to be flexible and strong, and does not contain nor is coated with PET.That means for the first time-and only available from SEE-e-commerce and D2C retailers have the opportunity to use 100% circular packaging made with recycled and renewable raw materials, curbside recyclable, and designed for use in an automated bagging, sealing, and printing system.Responsibly Sourced, Renewable MaterialsUse of recycled and renewable raw materials such as the wood fiber in paper, is a critical component of the circular economic model. Renewable resources can be naturally replaced in a finite amount of time on a human scale.We believe it is critical that in addition to bringing renewable raw materials into the mix, that we support the replacement of trees used for paper production. Fiber source certification such as those we follow from the Sustainable Forestry Initiatives, Forest Stewardship Council, and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification promote sustainable forest management and ensure fiber sources are replenished in a responsible way.Originally published on SEE's website.SEE®, Wednesday, July 26, 2023, Press release pictureSEE's BUBBLE WRAP® brand paper bubble mailerView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from SEE® on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: SEE®Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/seerEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: SEE®View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/770422/The-Natural-Fit-SEEs-Paper-Based-Packaging-for-E-Commerce]"

This compares with income available for common shareholders of $356 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2022.PG&amp;E Corporation Logo (PRNewsfoto/PG&amp;E Corporation)The increase in GAAP results was primarily driven by lower costs related to PG&amp;E Corporation's and Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (Utility) reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 11) and lower wildfire-related costs, and higher Fire Victim Trust tax benefit net of securitization.""Through the first half of 2023, we feel confident that we continue to reduce physical risk on our system overall, and that our investments since 2017 have made a dramatic difference in preventing catastrophic wildfires,"" said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&amp;E Corporation.  ""We also expect continued steady and predictable improvement in our financial health, which in turn allows us to further invest and innovate as we build a climate-resilient energy system for California's future.""Story continuesNon-GAAP Core EarningsPG&amp;E Corporation's non-GAAP core earnings, which exclude non-core items, were $494 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2023, compared with $536 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, during the same period in 2022.The decrease in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP core earnings is primarily driven by timing items and other increases, including property taxes, partially offset by savings in operating and maintenance costs net of redeployment.Non-core items, which management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, totaled $88 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2023, compared with $180 million after tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, during the same period in 2022.PG&amp;E Corporation uses ""non-GAAP core earnings,"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. See the accompanying tables for a reconciliation of non-GAAP core earnings to consolidated earnings available for common shareholders.2023 GuidancePG&amp;E Corporation is updating 2023 GAAP earnings guidance in the range of $1.04 to $1.13 per diluted share. Factors driving GAAP earnings include costs related to unrecoverable interest expense of $370 million to $430 million after tax and other earnings factors, including allowance for funds used during construction equity, incentive revenues, tax benefits, and cost savings, net of below-the-line costs. Additional factors include the amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and accretion of the related Wildfire Fund liability, wildfire-related costs, PG&amp;E Corporation's and the Utility's reorganization cases under Chapter 11, and investigation remedies, partially offset by Fire Victim Trust tax benefits and prior period net regulatory impact.The guidance range for projected 2023 non-GAAP core earnings is reaffirmed at $1.19 to $1.23 per diluted share. The guidance range for non-core items, which management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, is updated to $210 million to $320 million after tax.Guidance is based on various assumptions and forecasts, including those relating to authorized revenues, future expenses, capital expenditures, rate base, equity issuances, and certain other factors.Supplemental Financial InformationIn addition to the financial information accompanying this release, presentation slides have been furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are available on PG&amp;E Corporation's website at: http://investor.pgecorp.com/financials/quarterly-earnings-reports/default.aspx.Earnings Conference Call PG&amp;E Corporation will also hold a conference call on July 27, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its second quarter 2023 results.

Non-GAAP core earnings is calculated as income available for common shareholders less non-core items. ""Non-core items"" include items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings and affect comparability of financial results between periods, consisting of the items listed in Exhibit A. Non-GAAP core EPS is calculated as non-GAAP core earnings divided by common shares outstanding (taken on a basic basis in the event of a GAAP loss and a diluted basis in the event of a GAAP gain).PG&amp;E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on ""non-GAAP core earnings"" and ""non-GAAP core EPS"" in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. PG&amp;E Corporation and the Utility use non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating planning, and employee incentive compensation. PG&amp;E Corporation and the Utility believe that non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance. With respect to our projection of non-GAAP core EPS for the years 2024-2026, PG&amp;E Corporation is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the reconciling items that may affect GAAP net income without unreasonable effort. The reconciling items are primarily due to the future impact of wildfire-related costs, timing of regulatory recoveries, special tax items, and investigation remedies. These reconciling items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, the GAAP measures.Non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS are not substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures such as consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pge-corporation-reports-second-quarter-results-on-track-to-deliver-solid-2023-301887021.htmlSOURCE PG&amp;E Corporation]"

HoganThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, system services and clear aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the third quarter and 2023 overall. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and we'll open the call to questions. Overall, I'm pleased to report another better-than-expected quarter with Q2 revenues and operating margins that exceeded our guidance. Q2 results reflect improving trends across regions, strength in teen and younger patient volumes, driven by momentum in both submitters and utilization as well as continued growth from Invisalign First. In the Teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 195,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the second quarter. An increase of 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, reflecting the highest annual growth rate in the Teen segment since 2021. For Systems and Services, second quarter revenues of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially and down very slightly 1% year-over-year. For Q2, sequential increases in systems and services revenues, reflects increased scanner volumes across the regions and higher services and nonsystem revenues, reflecting increased sales of certified preowned or what we call CPO scanners and higher subscription revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues from a large number of iTero scanners in the field. We also had higher nonsystem scanner revenues related to our certified preowned, again CPOs and our scanner leasing and rental programs. For Q2, total Clear Aligner revenues of $832.7 million, up 5.4% sequentially and 4.3% year-over-year. Q2 sequential revenue growth rate is consistent with our historical 3-year average and reflects growth across all regions. Q2 non-case revenues at $80 million were up 6.2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from Vivera Retainers and Invisalign Doctor subscription program, or DSP, our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program and commerce sales for aligner-related consumables, like aligner cases and whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been successful in addressing an important and growing opportunity for experienced Invisalign doctors. It is our first subscription-based clear aligner program that enables doctors to reach new patients and provide them with a better overall experience. DSP enables doctors flexibilities to treat simple touch-up cases or offer their patients a superior, flexible and convenient retention solution. We introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021. We expanded it to Spain and the Nordic countries in Q2 2023, and we'll launch DSP in France and the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. We have also extended DSP to DSO partners who recognize the value of our Invisalign subscription aligner model. Over the past 2 years, our DSP subscription program has continued to ramp and in Q2 drove strong volume growth in touch-up cases, typically 5 to 10 stage cases of aligners. For Q2 '23, we shipped over 18,000 DSP touch-up cases in North America, up from 15,500 and in Q1 '23 and more than double the case volume in Q2 '22 last year. Given its continued success and contribution to our growth this year, DSP touch-up cases are included in my overall commentary for clear aligners. Otherwise, specified in my remarks, our case volumes and metrics do not include DSP and touch up cases. For Q2, total clear aligner volumes were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 clear aligner volumes, including DSP touch-up cases, were up 5.4% sequentially and up 2.4% year-over-year. For the Americas, Q2 clear aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the region from both ortho and GP dentist channels, an increase in teen case starts driven by momentum from Invisalign First and increased adult patients from the GP dentist channel. In North America, adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 in 3 product drove sequential volume growth. For Q2, North American ortho utilization was up sequentially and down a fraction year-over-year, including DSP touch-up cases. Q2 North American ortho utilization was up both sequentially and year-over-year as noted in our Q2 '23 earnings slides. For EMEA, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially in year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region and continued adoption of Invisalign Moderate, Invisalign Comprehensive 3 in 3 products, as well as an increase in teen case starts, which grew sequentially in year-over-year, driven by Invisalign First and our new Invisalign Teen case packs. On a sequential basis, clear aligner growth was led by Iberia, Italy, (inaudible) and Turkey. For APAC, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year-over-year, reflecting improving trends in China, as well as other key markets like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India. Q2 APAC results also reflect increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients, driven by growth from Invisalign First in the orthodontic channel, which is especially important as we enter the China teen season in Q3. Q2 APAC results also reflect growth in the GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year-over-year. During Q2, we continued to roll out the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 in 3 product in APAC, where it is now available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan and India. We plan to launch Invisalign 3 in 3 in China in Q3. We are also pleased with the additional adoption of 3 in 3 product in APAC, where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within the Invisalign product portfolio. In June, we hosted 2023 Invisalign APAC Summit in Singapore and brought together nearly 1,000 orthodontists and general practitioners, dentists and clinic staff from 18 countries across the Asia Pacific region. The Summit showcased Invisalign and iTero products, the Align Digital platform and the recent and upcoming innovations, while also highlighting our doctors' experience with digital transformation and how it improves the patient treatment journey. Attendees joined expert sessions focused on enhancing treatment planning efficiency, optimizing digital workflows, addressing the unique needs of teens and younger patients in exploring the essential aspect shaping today's digitally driven orthodontic practices. Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to Orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through teen-specific sales and marketing programs and product features unique to the Invisalign system. For Q2, total clear aligner cases for teenagers were up 7% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and EMEA regions on a year-over-year basis. Teen case starts were in the APAC region, driven by increased submitters, and in the EMEA region driven by increased submitters and utilization, both in the orthodontic channel. Last year, we introduced the teen case packs in the United States and Canada, and in Q1, Q2, we launched them in France, Scandinavia and Iberia. For the quarter, teen case packs increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength in EMEA. Invisalign First also was up sequentially in year-over-year across all regions and continues to drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among young patients. Invisalign First aligners are designed for Phase I treatment, typically in growing children 6 to 10 years old, making up about 20% of orthodontic case starts. For the dental service organizations, or DSO customers, Q2 clear aligner volumes increased sequentially, primarily from the Americas region. Overall, clear aligner growth rate from DSO doctors continues to outpace non-DSO doctors and our DSD touch-up cases are ramping nicely up as DSO doctors understand the value of the subscription program brings regarding pricing and flexibility for their patients. Invisalign is one of the most trusted brands in the orthodontic industry globally among both doctors and patients. On the consumer marketing front, we delivered $10.3 billion impressions and had 30.9 million visits to our website in Q2 '23. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents, teens about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram across all markets, as well as key social media influencers and brand ambassadors. In the Americas, we focused on reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents through our influencer and creator-centric campaigns, partnering with leading smile squad creators, including Marsai Martin, Rylie Shaw and Jeremy Lin. Each of these creators shared their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners. Additionally, in the United States, we work closely with athletes over time, a high school sports social media platform that showcases the benefits of Invisalign treatment. Brand interest remained strong throughout the quarter with 9.2 million consumers visiting our websites in the Americas region, representing 17% growth year-on-year. In EMEA region, we partnered with new influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta. In Germany, we launched new testimonial campaigns highlighting the stories of 7 young adults and teens who share why they chose Invisalign treatment and how it impacted their lives. Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.7 billion media impressions and 9.7 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 12 million visitors to our websites and over $4.8 billion impression. We expanded our region in Japan and India via TikTok, Meta and YouTube. We partner with key influencers like Rima Kallingal and Kamiya Jain. We saw increased brand interest in consumers as evidenced by 270% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 46% year-over-year increase in Japan. Adoption of My Invisalign consumer and patient apps continued to increase with 3.1 million downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, a 28% year-over-year growth. Uses of other digital tools also continue to increase. ClinCheck Live Update was used by 40,000 doctors on more than 580,000 cases, reducing time spent in modifying treatment by 20%. Invisalign Practice app is increasing in adoption with 88,000 doctors who are actively using this app and 5.1 million photos were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign Practice app. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.John F. MoriciThanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.002 billion up 6.3% from the prior quarter and up 3.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.3 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. And unfavorably impacted by approximately $19.4 million year-over-year or approximately 1.9%. Clear Aligners Q2 revenues of $832.7 million were up 5.4% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, higher non-case revenues and higher ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 clear aligner revenues were up 4.3%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher non-case revenues and higher volumes. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced products, partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect lower discounts, higher additional aligners, price increases and favorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in noncomprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. In Q1 '23, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive 3 in 3 products in most markets, and we have continued to expand into more markets, as previously mentioned. The 3 in 3 configuration offers our doctor customers, our Invisalign comprehensive treatment with 3 additional aligners included within 3 years of the treatment end date, instead of unlimited additional aligners with 5 years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price. Over time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with 2 or fewer additional aligners. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 in 3 product and anticipate that it will continue to grow, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time, compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product. As revenues from subscriptions, retainers and ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Q2 '23 clear aligner revenues were impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.2 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.3 million or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $13 million or up 1% sequentially and $138.6 million or up 12.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q2 '23 Systems and Services revenue of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially, mostly due to higher scanner volume, higher revenues from our certified preowned program and higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were down 1%, primarily due to lower scanner volume and unfavorable ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs. Q2 '23 Systems and Services revenue were impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.1 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.1 million or approximately 1.8%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.3 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase and up $8.6 million or 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales, and the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands, and we introduced new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets. As such, our model is changing. We expect to continue growing our programs and as offering our CPO units for purchase and selling the way the customer -- our customers desire. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners, is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanner sold. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 71.2%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 72.4%, up 0.7 points sequentially, primarily due to the lower mix of additional aligners, favorable manufacturing variances and higher ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 65.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially, primarily from lower service and freight costs, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 5.3 points year-over-year, primarily from lower service and freight costs and higher services revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs. Q2 operating expenses were $541.7 million, up sequentially 2.8% and up 8.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $14.5 million, primarily from higher consumer marketing spend and higher incentive compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $42.3 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&amp;D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $505 million up 2.9% sequentially and up 8.4% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $171.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.2% up 3 points sequentially and down 2.2 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to higher gross margin, as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange of 0.1 points. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.1 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring other charges, operating margin for the second quarter was 21.3%, up 2.8 points sequentially and down 2 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.3 million compared to an income of $1.1 million in the first quarter and a loss of $14.6 million in the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.8%, consistent with the first quarter effective tax rate of 34.8% and 35% in the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly results in 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.46, up sequentially $0.32 and up $0.02 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.02 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.15 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.22 for the second quarter, up $0.40 sequentially and up $0.07 year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in our prior year 2022 non-GAAP EPS reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term, and long-term marketable securities were $1.338 billion, up sequentially $112.4 million and up $56.6 million year-over-year. Of our $1.338 billion balance, $314.3 million was held in the U.S. and $719.5 million was held by our international entities. In Q2, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental, a multidisciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the U.S. During Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $908.4 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 81 days, down approximately 2 days sequentially and down approximately 4 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $251.9 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $58.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $193.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q2 results. While the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, we have seen improvements in the operating environment and the consumer demand signals that influence our outlook. For Q3 2023, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our Q3 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up from Q2 2023 as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in R&amp;D and go-to-market activities to drive growth. For full year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $3.99 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We also expect our full year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 17% and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%, a 1 point improvement from the guidance we provided in April of 2023. For 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction improvements, as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?Joseph M. HoganAt our continued growth despite the economic slowdown in uncertain environment, Q2 results demonstrate our resilience and adaptability. While we cannot predict future economic conditions, we're confident in our ability to focus and execute on our strategic growth initiatives. As a leader in digital transformation, we offer a powerful suite of innovative digital tools that make up the aligned digital platform, which provides a seamless end-to-end digital experience for doctors and their patients. Innovations launched over the last year include ClinCheck Live Update for 3D controls. This enables doctors to generate modified Invisalign patient treatment plans in real time, reducing modifications that used to take weeks to as little as 2 minutes. Improving practice productivity while also improving the quality of treatment plans. Invisalign Personal Plan, or IPP streamlines the treatment planning process and helps doctors achieve their desired treatment plans more consistently and efficiently. Invisalign Smile Architect allows general dentists to integrate clear aligner therapy into their comprehensive treatment plans by combining tooth alignment and restorative planning in a single platform. Invisalign Virtual Care, equips doctor with a next-generation remote monitoring solution that has new artificial intelligence-assisted capabilities to streamline their workflows. Cone beam computed tomography or CBCT, enables doctors to visualize the patient's roots as part of the digital treatment planning process. Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro, expand Align's existing Invisalign Outcome Simulator technology and adds the benefit of the company's ClinCheck In-Face Visualization tool that combines a photo of a patient's face, with their 3D treatment simulation, creating a truly personalized view of how their new smile will look. iTero-exocad Connector integrates iTero intraoral camera and NIRI images with exocad DentalCAD 3.1 software, allows dental professionals to visualize the internal and external structure of teeth. In addition to these and other incredible innovations in the coming years, we'll continue to build a digital platform and add new capabilities to improve clinical outcomes and elevate the patient experience to drive continued practice growth and positive patient experiences. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking to you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 6, where we'll share with you our views about the incredible market opportunity we have and how Align is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the transformation of the digital orthodontic industry. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperatorAt this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird.Jeffrey D. JohnsonJoe, congrats on a nice bounce back quarter here. I wanted to start really on the teen market. Obviously, that's where we all focus long term on the business. But that 9.7% year-over-year growth, when I look back last year, it was your first quarter in a long time of negative year-over-year growth in teens. So you had a bit of an easy comp there, although, obviously, '21 was a fantastic year. So I guess I'm trying to figure out in this economy, when I think about comps from '21 that were so tough, when I think about competition that's out there, where do you think that 9%, 10% teen growth is relative to where you expect to be normalized? Are we still expecting a nice improvement of this over the next few years back to kind of mid, upper teens, something like that? I just would like to get your views on that.Joseph M. HoganJeff, I mean you know how important that teen market is to us, like I talked about in the script of the 21 million case starts and the majority of those 75%, 80% being teen. So I look at that sequential growth in teens as being really positive. Now we did have a good number to compare against, like you said. But when I highlighted in our -- the Invisalign First product line and how well that product is doing overall, and it continues to grow phenomenally throughout the world in all 3 regions that we have. Our teen packs different business models or plans that we put together, really helps with that piece, too. So Jeff, when you look at our coming technology improvements and products and those kinds of things, they're targeted really well with the teen market also. So the numbers that you mentioned about potential growth and penetration in that marketplace, in line with our investments and where we think we'll go in the marketplace. But let's be honest, it's been -- that's a struggle to get orthodontists to really move on teens. But our top docs are almost exclusively Invisalign across the board. Our job is to bring this new technology out, but also infuse it well within doctors, so they're comfortable with the work practices and comfortable with the clinical outcomes. And I feel we've made really good progress in that area.Jeffrey D. JohnsonAll right. That's helpful. And then just would like an update maybe on China. Obviously, third quarter tends to be a big teen season there, but we're also seeing some mixed macro feedback on China as a whole kind of from an overall economic standpoint. So just what's kind of current tenor of business in China? And just remind us how bad were things in third quarter last year in China, we just kind of lose track of the COVID shutdowns and all that, but should third quarter be an easy comp in China? Or were things opening back up there before we got to the beginning of this year where they shut back down again.Joseph M. HoganYes. China, obviously, from an economic standpoint, Jeff, it's -- we watch that closely as everybody does, too, but we have to take it as it is right now. And we had a good quarter. We had a good start in the first quarter, too. And so we're seeing good sequential momentum, an improvement in that sense in the business overall. Obviously, when you look at the third quarter, I mean, we all know you watch our stock closely. We know the third quarter is a huge teen market in China, as I mentioned in the script, too. And we're really glued on that, but we feel very confident in the sense of our positioning there and where China stands right now. I can't comment on future economic activity there with any more accuracy than you can. But what we've experienced in the second quarter and what we see going into the third, we feel good about it.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John Block with Stifel.Jonathan David BlockI'll start on innovation. And Joe, going into '23, you called out this year is one of the biggest for Align in terms of innovation when we think about the company's history. At the end of the prepared remarks, that was really helpful. You laid out a handful of innovations. Where are you with the next wave? And when I say the next wave, any details that you can give with palatal expansion in terms of timing in the U.S., maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on the limited rollout in Canada to date. And is there anything else that we should expect more near term, i.e., maybe next 3 to 12 months before some of those longer-term aspirations come into play on direct printing? And then I'll ask my follow-up.Joseph M. HoganJohn, obviously, Invisalign palate expander has come a long way. You probably get -- that we've had some forays into Canada recently and good feedback on our product line. When we look at the investor conference coming up, we'll obviously give you a much more detailed discussion in the sense of where that product stands, and how we'll commercialize it. But overall, what I'd tell you, John, we know how to make it. We have a process that makes it. Remember, with our business, though, just making it doesn't mean anything, you've got to scale this thing to million, and so that's what our focus is right now, is how we scale, how we roll this out. There's obviously a lot of regulatory qualifications we have to meet in each area because it's a new device, too, but I feel good about that. And John, when you look our development, you know this well, you can almost draw a line between the production of product and then the software that we talked about with the software piece. Obviously, IPE represents both of those, right? It's new software and new kind of treatment planning, but it's actually a 3D-printed device that we haven't launched before. So just think about in the scale-up mode, but when we see you on September 6, we'll have many more details for you.Jonathan David BlockAnd then maybe as my second question, sort of one of those famous 2 partners. John, to start with you, can you elaborate on the ASP for comprehensive Q-over-Q? I believe you said it was down Q-over-Q, little confused because I think you would have had the full quarter the price increase on the 3x3 in the comprehensive. So if I've got that right, maybe if you can tease out why it would have been down Q-over-Q. And then, Joe, the upside for the cases, I'm packing it around 10,000 relative to the implied guide that you gave back for 2Q. I've got the U.S. cases essentially in line with our estimate. International seems to have really been the driver of the upside. And maybe to build on Jeff's question, can you just give some more details where the outperformance was? Was it China? Was it EMEA? Where do you see maybe the better-than-expected results specific to those international regions?John F. MoriciYes. Just first on the ASP, John. Yes, the comprehensive were down slightly, just a reflection of some of the product mix that we had as well as some of the discounts that we have partially offset by price decrease. So nothing out of the ordinary there, we actually saw an increase on a sequential basis for noncomp. But the comprehensive was just more mix.Joseph M. HoganJohn, back to me is -- yes, you're right. I mean, when you look at from a regional standpoint, EMEA and APAC stood out. Really across the board in EMEA, I mean, like I mentioned in my script, you had Iberia did well. U.K. did well. The Nordic side, we just introduced DSP and different things. We're excited about those areas, too. So -- and then the teen growth there overall across those geographies was good. So I mean, it's just -- I think just good strong performance. And then when you think about the EMEA economy, too, John, I mean last year there was a lot of uncertainty with the Ukraine situation that hasn't gotten any better, but Europeans and the European countries, I think, have solidified their economies around that. And just we're seeing some improvement from a consumer sentiment standpoint, too. So that's reflected in our numbers also. On APAC, obviously, China was good year-on-year. Japan actually was very strong for us, too, along with Korea, in different parts of Asia, as I mentioned. So it's still broadly really good improvements in both of those regions by country and also specifically in that teen segment that I mentioned. So we're seeing good improvement John, from a sequential standpoint.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichJohn, I guess, could you maybe just talk about how adult cases performed relative to your expectations, improved slightly, but I think still down a little bit year-over-year. And how are you thinking about the biggest swing factors that could impact revenue in the back half. Does the guidance kind of just reflect a continuation of the environment that you saw in 2Q? And is there any kind of part of the business that you're watching specifically, either teen versus adult in certain markets that you feel are especially big swing factors in the back half?John F. MoriciYes, I'll take that one, Nate. This is John. When you look at the commentary that we gave, we saw improving trends as we went into the second quarter. We see that in the results. And our guidance reflects that. It shows up in Q3, and it also gives us the confidence to talk to a guide for the total year. So that's how we've kind of factored things in and looking at the normal metrics in indices that help us with that. As far as adult versus teen, as we said, teen season now. We saw good results in Q2, and we expect that to continue in Q3. As we've said, China is a big market, U.S. big market in Q3, and we expect that to continue. And adults important for us, too. We have a lot of capabilities to be able to go to those general dentists and try to work where those adults might be wanting to come into treatment, and be able to help provide for them as well as our orthodontist. So we feel good about the efforts that we have to try to improve both teen and adult as we go through this year.Nathan Allen RichAnd then just a clarification on the touch-up cases. So -- it sounds like that's pressuring the North America ortho utilization metric. But if you back that out, or kind of include touch up, it would have been up year-over-year. I'd just be curious to get your sense of what portion of those 18,000 touch-up cases would have been cases kind of in your view in the past prior to DSP just so we get a sense of what that shift might look like.John F. MoriciYes. So those touch-up cases, as we talked to those 18,000, those would have been -- those are the touch-up cases that would have been the lower-stage products that we had 5 stage, maybe 7 up to 10, but in that range, 5 to 10, but probably more on the low side of that in terms of the stages. And we see this great adoption with the DSP program, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it doubled from last year. We wanted to give some commentary about how big this is becoming and show them in our kind of our discussion about the year-over-year, and the sequential and so on. And at Investor Day in September, I'll give a lot more detail about kind of where it came from, how it's become more and more important and what it means going forward because we're going to include these cases going forward. But in the end, we see in all cases where we see -- we've seen the DSP program, it drives incremental volume for us. those doctors continue to do those comprehensive cases that we see, but those doctors are also doing these low stage touch-up cases as well as retention. And we think that's a good thing for our doctors.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.Brandon VazquezI just wanted to follow up first on the DSP program. If we're doing our math correctly, it seems like most, if not all, of the year-over-year increase in case volumes, is actually coming from the DSP program. So one, is that correct? And two, maybe if it is, can you talk about where do you think the mix goes eventually to DSP? And is DSP at this point accretive to your case volumes? Or are you seeing accounts kind of switch what they would have been doing as kind of normal base volumes into DSP?John F. MoriciWe're actually seeing DSP as accretive. So we're not seeing -- we're seeing -- fundamentally, we're seeing doctors who were either making them themselves or going to lab or other ways of making the aligners actually switching over and continuing to give us those comprehensive cases, but then they're also now giving us the DSP cases. Remember, most of DSPs, the majority of DSP is retention, and it's the retention that we're providing. But then a subset of that is these touch-up cases and like I said, about 18,000 or so. And what we've also commented to it, it would have -- it would have helped us by about 1.5 points on an overall basis. So we reported our volumes up about 0.9%. And they would have been up 1.5 points on that to 2.4%. So it's accretive no matter how we look at it, and it's certainly accretive from a standpoint of the margin that it generates. It's generating some of the highest margin from our product portfolio that we have because the cost to serve is very straightforward for us. There's no additional aligners or anything else. So we recognize all the revenue as soon as we ship without additional aligners related to that.Brandon VazquezAnd then one other second on......Joseph M. HoganOne other clarification on your question was whether you put DSP or not, we were up year-over-year in our numbers.Brandon VazquezGot it. That's helpful. The next question is just on teens. I think, Joe, you had said a little earlier, a little frank about there's hurdles within the teen market and kind of pushing that share into existing accounts to get a little deeper. Can you guys just talk about what are kind of the top hurdles right now? Why has it been a little bit tougher to get the incremental share in the teen market? And what are you guys kind of focused on in the next 6 to 12 months to push that share forward?Joseph M. HoganIn general, when you look at orthodontic workflows, if they're not completely digitized in the sense of what they do, and you're kind of in a down cycle right now with orthodontists and their challenge. They feel like on a wire bracket side, they can just make more money with wires and brackets versus Invisalign because the raw material costs are 3.5x. Now if you're fully digitized, your workflows and everything else, obviously, you make more money with Invisalign. But I think in these kind of challenging economic times, it's just more difficult to move the orthodontic community over to the clear aligner piece because they're just used to the workflow of what we have with versus wires and brackets. I can say Invisalign first seems to be an exception to that. In the sense of how Phase I kind of patients are treated. That's not a constant when you look at what's going on in the orthodontic industry. But we see a lot more interest in Phase I with Invisalign First than we thought before. I think that's going to help to be a span breaker for us in this whole thing. In the future, there's no doubt to us in the sense that clear aligners are the future, no white spot lesions, obviously 6 months faster than a normal kind of a treatment, much easier for patients. We know all those things. When you ask what the biggest issues are, they're not basically clinical anymore. It's about workflow. Workflow and confidence in orthodontic practice.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonCongrats on the quarter and thanks so much for the question. One, this -- don't take this as a complaint because I'm very happy that we have full year guide. What I was -- wanted to ask was like what -- did you guys see sort of in the end markets or in your -- the visibility of your results to the macro picture that made sort of this time the right time to kind of move on from what we've had in the quarterly guide the last couple of quarters into this sort of longer guidance.Joseph M. HoganYes, I'll give you the high-level view, and I'll turn it over to John, Elizabeth for the ground thing. But I mean, obviously, we had a good second quarter, and we feel we can see through to the third quarter, whatever -- at that point, too, like we said, with the qualifiers is continued economic situation that we see now, we feel confident just based on what we understand from a cyclical standpoint to be able to call the fourth quarter. And so look, we're still in very difficult economic times and uncertain times. But with the second quarter out of the way and with what we talk about improvement, particularly in a sequential sense, we just felt like I mean we're going to give it to you, you're going to make it up. So we might give you the best guess we have. But John can give you more?John F. MoriciLook, I can't add much more to that. We've got now a couple good quarters behind us. We've seen stability kind of turning to improving trends. It's a good position to be in. We continue to see that into the third quarter. As Joe said, it's not great, but it's better than it has been from an overall economic standpoint. And so based on the order trends and kind of how things are looking, we felt comfortable about Q3 and translate that to total year as well.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonAnd just as a follow-up, are you guys taking any different approach to sort of like, sales either so from like a personnel perspective or a focus versus earlier in the year? I know sometimes you guys have sort of been ramping reps. And then that had sort of flatlined. So I just wanted to understand sort of like how you're thinking about that as we go into the balance of the year and sort of set up for 2024?Joseph M. HoganElizabeth, I'd say our sales practices are consistent and dynamic in the same way, it consistent in the sense of the number of salespeople we have, how we train those salespeople, how they go to market. We obviously offer different products in different areas. We split up orthodontics, salespeople and general dentistry salespeople specifically because it's just a different kind of a call. So there's no I'd say, big change in the sense of how we go to market. And obviously, our iTero sales force works really closely with the Invisalign sales force and overlaps in some areas. But I might be missing your question, but there's no, I'd say, material changes going on from a sales as salespeople, a number of salespeople standpoint and specifically the way we approach the market.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.Michael Leonidovich RyskinI got a couple of quick ones. One is well, actually kind of related. One is just related to the results, 1Q to 2Q and sort of your outlook for 3Q, just sort of a yes or no question. Is it safe to say that you're kind of back to the usual seasonality you've seen historically, it's been a little volatile for the last couple of years, but it seems like we're setting the back in that routine. Is it safe to say that, that should be our base case approach going forward?John F. MoriciWell, I think what we see is in terms of our Q2 to Q3 guide, that is more of a typical seasonality flat to slightly up from Q2 to Q3. So that's -- that is that how that goes going forward. I think given the commentary that we've given just the overall macro uncertainty, we're not ready to say that. We're completely back to normal seasonality. But what we see in the short term here in the guidance that we gave that reflects that.Michael Leonidovich RyskinAnd then the second one would be on the Analyst Day. I mean, a couple of pieces there. One is, could you just -- what goes into the thought process that now is the right time to have the Analyst Day. As you say markets are still pretty uncertain. There's still some volatility, visibility is not fully back. So kind of what goes into that decision? And then related to that, the long-term guide, is that something you're going to be addressing just as we start thinking about modeling 2024 and going forward from there?Joseph M. HoganWe usually do this about every 2 years, Michael. It is a really sophisticated algorithm we use to figure that out. It's about every 2 years. And we think it's just about time for that, too, from the standpoint of just to reinitiate the investor base in the sense of where we're investing, how we see the marketplace. And just a good summary of a lot of the questions that have been asked.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.Jason M. BednarGood afternoon. I wanted to touch on a few things that stood out to us in the quarter. Maybe first, just the combination of a sequential increase in doctors you ship to plus higher utilization across all channels that you serve. Again, always good to see that combination come together. I know you don't provide the granularity anymore on doctor shipped across the U.S. or international markets, but -- just I guess, directionally, are you able to specify whether the increase in doctors is exclusive to China coming back online and expansion in APAC? Or did you see an increase in users in your North American channels and EMEA channels as well?John F. MoriciYes, Jason, you're right. We don't give that level of detail, but we saw more doctors that we ship to in APAC related to China, as you said, and we saw it in other regions as well. So we are pleased with the number of doctors that we're shipping to. It's a reflection of our products and what they want to do and then as well, being able to be up on a utilization basis is a good metric as well.Jason M. BednarI guess maybe just to follow up there, John, real quick. Can you confirm whether or not you saw that increase in North America, orthos or GPs or both?John F. MoriciYes, we saw improvement for North America as well.Jason M. BednarAnd then I know we got some good details on some of your APAC markets, including China. But I guess wondering if you can talk about just monthly cadence of U.S. trends throughout the quarter and maybe even here in July. Some of the work we've done shows that there's maybe a bit more mix trends in April and June, May was pretty strong. I guess just wondering how that drives what you were seeing in your case shipment trends throughout the quarter? And then same question for EMEA, if you could elaborate just on how the quarter unfolded in that region.John F. MoriciYes. We're really not giving -- like -- I don't really want to get into the month-by-month activity. I think the results kind of show where they were, Jason, and then it also kind of reflects what we've been able to give from a guidance standpoint as well. But without getting into months by country and region and so on, it gets a little difficult to give that level of detail. But I think the results that we have for Q2 and what we've talked about how the sequential improvement and what we were able to see on a quarter-over-quarter basis and what it means for the guidance kind of speak to that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.Brandon CouillardYou mentioned scanner ASPs as a bad guy in terms of segment gross margin sequentially and year-over-year. Joe, you just talk about the competitive environment and whether you're seeing pricing pressure intensifying, just your macro view there would be helpful.Joseph M. HoganYes, I wouldn't call it a bad guy. I think what we tried to communicate was, we have a mix in there from a price standpoint. We feel good about our upper-end product line and the prices we're able to get for a 5D plus Flex and it's a premier scanner in the marketplace. As you mentioned before and as you know, I mean, there's a certain sensitivity in the marketplace about these kind of capital expenditures in a dental office when a lot of the economics are challenged right now in the orthodontic and in dental side. So we see that. But despite that, you could see we turned really good numbers around. Our CPOs help us to fight on the lower end. CPOs are the certified preowned that allow us to go down market if we have to. And obviously, when you look at the marketplace, it's pretty -- if you have the -- what we would call the confocal imaging scanners, like that we lead with. And then there's products like (inaudible) whatever they try to take the low end, and whatever. But we feel -- I feel good about our capability, our value proposition, and I think our numbers reflect that this quarter and in the past too. So I'm not saying there's not a competitive environment. I just feel we have a superior product line, and then we have a good value stream that we offer from a standpoint of the integration with Invisalign through iTero and then on [DSP].Brandon CouillardAnd John, you mentioned freight costs coming down year-over-year as a positive tailwind to gross margins. I think first time in a while. I think that's been the case. Do you expect that to be sustainable over the next several quarters? And any color on how we should about gross margins in the second half of the year relative to 2Q base?John F. MoriciI think it's a reflection of just its freight, but maybe some of the material costs and others that as we manage things, manage our business, we see less inflationary pressure from kind of the raw material/freight and other inputs. And we're always driving productivity. We're always trying to be improve our productivity. We saw that in some of our gross margin improvements, both for clear aligner and the scanner and services. And we'll work to continue to manage it. But seeing some of those pricing pressures, the input pricing pressure come down and hopefully that continues.OperatorAnd we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks.Shirley StacyThank you, everyone, and thank you again for joining us.

In Q4'22, we changed to a long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. Our previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rate included certain non-recurring and period-specific items, that produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the Company's long-term effective tax rate. This new methodology became effective January 1, 2022 and we recast prior periods in 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, when we refer to non-GAAP financial measures they will exclude the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of certain acquired intangibles, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, and arbitration award gain, and associated tax impacts.Our management believes that the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our recurring core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business.There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures as they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP as well as a non-GAAP basis and by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our GAAP financial measures to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures included herein and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

92,375c0b6c-a6c6-3b44-aab6-74c3dda06bcb,MRO,2023-07-27,Earnings Preview: Marathon Oil (MRO) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-marathon-oil-mro-140231970.html,1690380151,STORY,['MRO'],"[Marathon Oil (MRO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -67.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.51 billion, down 34.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.44% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Oil?For Marathon Oil, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marathon Oil would post earnings of $0.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of +17.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marathon Oil doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, DT Midstream (DTM), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $228.87 million, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for DT Midstream has been revised 0.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.15%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that DT Midstream will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We must therefore ensure that the markets for these products remain competitive, and companies are free to choose the products that best meet their needs,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.A spokesperson for Microsoft said Microsoft would continue to co-operate with the European Commission and that the company remained committed to finding solutions to address the Commission's concerns.Story continuesReuters reported earlier this month that the EU antitrust watchdog was set to open a probe after Microsoft declined to offer bigger price cuts on its Office without Teams.The European Commission hopes a price differential between Office with Teams and Office without the app will ensure a level playing field with rivals and give consumers more choice, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.German rival alfaview, which last week filed a complaint similar to Slack's with the EU executive, welcomed the EU investigation.""With our complaint, we want to make clear that this is not about a fight between two US tech giants, but about the protection of innovations of all kinds,"" its CEO and founder Niko Fostiropoulos said in a statement.EU fines for antitrust violations can go as high as 10% of a company's global turnover.($1 = 0.8988 euros) (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta, David Evans and Jane Merriman)]"

We must therefore ensure that the markets for these products remain competitive,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU's antitrust commissioner.“This is why we are investigating whether Microsoft’s tying of its productivity suites with Teams may be in breach of EU competition rules,” she added.Microsoft said in a statement that it respected “the European Commission’s work on this case.” It added that it would “continue to cooperate with the commission and remain committed to finding solutions that will address its concerns.”Only last week, the German alfaview video conferencing company added its own complaint over Microsoft Teams, arguing that bundling gives the U.S. tech giant an unmatched competitive advantage “that is not justified by performance and that competitors like alfaview cannot match.”The commission says opening the investigation in no way determines the outcome.Europe has led the way in ratcheting up scrutiny of Big Tech companies over worries that they have become too dominant. When Brussels has looked into Microsoft’s recent deals, however, the company has prevailed.Story continuesThe EU approved Microsoft’s plan to buy video game maker Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, after the company offered to automatically license popular Activision titles like “Call of Duty” for cloud gaming platforms.Microsoft also has won EU clearance to buy video game company Zenimax and speech recognition company Nuance.___AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed from London.]"

Who would have thought that was in the cards for the first seven months of 2023? Despite the rally, there are still a number of hidden gem stocks and overlooked stocks that investors can get their hands on this year.That’s not to say that they’ll be the next Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or that the stock will go on a blistering rally in the short term.However, the point is simpler than that. Despite the S&amp;P 500 rising significantly in the past four-and-a-half months — up 20% from the March low — there are still many overlooked stocks that haven’t participated in the upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s take a look at a few of these hidden gem stocks now.Best Hidden Gem Stocks: Target (TGT)Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comWhile Target (NYSE:TGT) ruffled some of its customers’ feathers last month, that shouldn’t distract investors who are focused on the long term. That’s especially true if the United States is able to avoid a recession. If the country avoids a recession, then consumer spending will continue to hum along, while back to school shopping and the holidays will be additional catalysts.The stock suffered a nasty 22% correction, as it fell for nine straight sessions in June. From the high, shares are down a little more than 50%. Here’s the thing though: Analysts still expect growth!Revenue growth is nothing to write home about as consensus expectations call for sub-2% growth this year and next year. However, analysts expect about 36% earnings growth this year and almost 25% growth next year.This leaves Target shares trading at just 16 times this year’s earnings, while the stock pays a 3.3% dividend yield. Oh yeah, and it has raised that dividend for 52 consecutive years.Walgreen (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comGetting Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) stock does require a little faith; faith that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession, and faith that management will be able to turn around some of its woes.Story continuesTo some extent, the first worry — a recession — is less intimidating. Whether there’s a recession or not, consumers will still pick up necessities and prescriptions. However, Walgreens needs to turn its ship around in order to spell high returns.Forecasts call for mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and next year, but earnings estimates get a bit messy. While non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) expectations sit at about $4 a share — leaving the stock trading at just seven times earnings — GAAP expectations call for a loss on the year.On the plus side, those same GAAP estimates call for earnings of about $3 a share in fiscal 2024, while Walgreens is operating in its last fiscal quarter of 2023 already. Wwhile fiscal 2023 was a bad year for the firm, 2024 is looking brighter. If that’s the case, Walgreens deserves a spot on our list of hidden gem stocks.That said, shares recently hit a multi-year low after its earnings disappointment in late June. Due to the dip, the dividend yield now sits at 6.4% and while the company has raised its payout for 47 straight year, it risks losing that streak if it doesn’t hike again in the next few quarters.Comcast (CMCSA)Comcast (CMCSA) sign on the Comcast regional headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOne stock that doesn’t get much love is Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Yet, the firm has a foothold in multiple markets.Many know Comcast for cable and internet offerings — it’s the largest provider for both services in the U.S. — but it has built itself into an impressive conglomerate. Comcast also owns NBC Universal, which controls stations like NBC, E!, Bravo, CNBC and many others. It also owns DreamWorks Animations, Universal Parks &amp; Resorts, Universal Pictures and Peacock, a streaming media platform.Comcast also owns a one-third stake in Hulu, that it will likely sell to Disney (NYSE:DIS) in early 2024. Disney owns the other two thirds. Despite having a larger market capitalization than Disney, the latter seems to get much more recognition than the former.Shares pay out a 2.7% dividend yield, and although CMCSA stock is cheap at 11.5 times this year’s earnings estimate, it has the type of growth that tends to go with cheap stocks.Estimates call for a 1% revenue dip this year before rebound to 2.6% growth next year. As for earnings, estimates call for flat growth this year, before expanding to 12% growth in 2024. Unlike Walgreens, Comcast is only operating in its second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in WBA.

103,763e9876-5bef-3368-b580-958d7bf9d8e5,SBUX,2023-07-27,Yum Brands (YUM) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-yum-earnings-expected-140210295.html,1690380130,STORY,"['YUM', 'SBUX']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Yum Brands (YUM) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.75 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum?For Yum, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yum would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of -7.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Yum appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsStarbucks (SBUX), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.95 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +13.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $9.3 billion, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Starbucks has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.87%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Starbucks will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When investing in dividend stocks, seasoned investors pay attention to growth in their payouts over the years. Through this, they aim to benefit through a combination of growing income stream, capital appreciation, and protection against inflation. Returns of dividend growth stocks have surpassed those without any growth tracks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned RMB Capital’s research which revealed that dividend growers achieved a positive return of 9.62% from 1972 until December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79% during the same period.According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers exhibited lower volatility over the last 50 years. Due to this, many financial experts are now recommending the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental part of equity portfolios for their clients. The consistent growth and stability of dividends make them an attractive option for investors seeking reliable long-term returns. From 1973 to 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return to shareholders, whereas dividend payers and dividend non-payers returned 9.18% and -0.60%, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Investor Relations Earnings Release (Unaudited)Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy’s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing return on equity (ROE), ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.Ongoing ROEOngoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity’s average stockholder’s equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)GAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method. Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or loss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy’s core earnings and underlying performance. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no such adjustments to GAAP earnings and therefore GAAP earnings equal ongoing earnings for these periods.Note 1. Earnings Per Share SummaryXcel Energy’s second quarter diluted earnings were $0.52 per share in 2023, compared with $0.60 per share in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable weather experienced in Colorado and SPS territories as well as higher O&amp;M and interest charges, without expected increases in regulatory recovery to offset these drivers including the outcome of the Minnesota Electric Rate Case. Fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the related variation in revenues).Summarized diluted EPS for Xcel Energy:Three Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 30Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share2023202220232022PSCo$0.17$0.24$0.56$0.56NSP-Minnesota0.230.220.480.45SPS0.150.170.250.27NSP-Wisconsin0.050.030.130.11Earnings from equity method investments — WYCO0.010.010.020.02Regulated utility (a)0.600.671.431.41Xcel Energy Inc. and Other(0.08)(0.07)(0.15)(0.11)Total (a)$0.52$0.60$1.28$1.30(a) Amounts may not add due to rounding.PSCo — Earnings decreased $0.07 per share for the second quarter of 2023 and were flat year-to-date. Year-to-date earnings primarily reflect higher recovery of infrastructure investment (electric and natural gas), offset by increased depreciation, O&amp;M expenses, interest charges and unfavorable weather.NSP-Minnesota — Earnings increased $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2023 and $0.03 year-to-date. The year-to-date change was driven by increased electric infrastructure investment (non-fuel riders).SPS — Earnings decreased $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2023 and year-to-date. The impact of regulatory rate outcomes and sales growth was more than offset by unfavorable weather, increased depreciation and interest expenses (excluding the impact of the prior year Texas rate case surcharge amounts).NSP-Wisconsin — Earnings increased $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2023 and year-to-date. Additional electric and natural gas infrastructure investment recoveries were partially offset by higher depreciation and O&amp;M expenses.Xcel Energy Inc. and Other — Primarily includes financing costs at the holding company and earnings from Energy Impact Partners (EIP) funds equity method investments. Earnings decreased $0.01 per share for the second quarter and $0.04 year-to-date, largely attributable to higher interest charges.Components significantly contributing to changes in 2023 EPS compared to 2022:Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per ShareThree Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 30GAAP and ongoing diluted EPS — 2022$0.60$1.30Components of change - 2023 vs. 2022Lower electric revenues, net of electric fuel and purchased power(0.23)(0.09)Higher O&amp;M expenses(0.02)(0.09)Higher interest charges(0.03)(0.08)Higher natural gas revenues, net of cost of natural gas sold and transported—0.08Lower taxes (other than income taxes)0.060.04Higher other income (expense)0.020.03Lower depreciation and amortization0.100.02Lower effective tax rate (ETR) (a)—0.02Other, net0.020.05GAAP and ongoing diluted EPS — 2023$0.52$1.28(a) Includes production tax credits (PTCs) and plant regulatory amounts which are primarily offset as a reduction to electric revenues.Note 2. Regulated Utility ResultsEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings — Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial performance. However, decoupling mechanisms in Colorado and sales true-up mechanisms in Minnesota predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather for the electric utility in those jurisdictions.Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.Weather — Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:Three Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 302023 vs. Normal2022 vs. Normal2023 vs. 20222023 vs. Normal2022 vs. Normal2023 vs. 2022Retail electric$0.001$0.028$(0.027)$0.003$0.049$(0.046)Decoupling and sales true-up(0.017)(0.013)(0.004)(0.023)(0.023)—Electric total$(0.016)$0.015$(0.031)$(0.020)$0.026$(0.046)Firm natural gas(0.003)0.003(0.006)0.0260.0190.007Total$(0.019)$0.018$(0.037)$0.006$0.045$(0.039)Sales — Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales in 2023 compared to 2022:Three Months Ended June 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyActualElectric residential(8.0)%3.3%(13.1)%(1.1)%(3.5)%Electric C&amp;I(3.1)1.32.91.60.5Total retail electric sales(4.6)1.90.20.9(0.6)Firm natural gas sales3.7(16.5)N/A(11.4)(4.1)Three Months Ended June 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyWeather-NormalizedElectric residential(1.3)%0.1%(3.1)%(1.0)%(1.0)%Electric C&amp;I(1.1)0.74.01.51.2Total retail electric sales(1.1)0.52.80.90.6Firm natural gas sales6.0(3.5)N/A(2.0)2.5Six Months Ended June 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyActualElectric residential(3.4)%(0.6)%(7.6)%(4.1)%(2.9)%Electric C&amp;I(2.1)(0.2)5.00.80.8Total retail electric sales(2.5)(0.4)2.7(0.6)(0.3)Firm natural gas sales5.3(11.6)N/A(13.6)(1.8)Six Months Ended June 30PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyWeather-NormalizedElectric residential(1.1)%(0.6)%0.3%(0.9)%(0.7)%Electric C&amp;I(1.3)(0.3)5.51.11.2Total retail electric sales(1.2)(0.4)4.60.50.6Firm natural gas sales1.5(1.8...)N/A(2.1)0.1Weather-normalized electric sales growth (decline) — year-to-datePSCo — Residential sales declined due to decreased use per customer, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in customers.

C&amp;I sales increased due to higher use per customer, primarily driven by the energy sector.NSP-Wisconsin — Residential sales declined due to decreased use per customer, offset by a 0.7% increase in customers. C&amp;I sales growth was associated with customer growth, experienced largely in the transportation and professional services sectors.Weather-normalized natural gas sales growth (decline) — year-to-dateNatural gas sales reflect a lower use per residential customer in all jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in C&amp;I use per customer in PSCo. In addition, residential and C&amp;I customer growth was 1.2% and 0.7%, respectively.Electric Margin — Electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses. Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium. However, these price fluctuations generally have minimal earnings impact due to fuel recovery mechanisms. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.Electric revenues, fuel and purchased power and margin:Three Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 30(Millions of Dollars)2023202220232022Electric revenues$2,601$2,923$5,364$5,556Electric fuel and purchased power(1,030)(1,181)(2,147)(2,275)Electric margin$1,571$1,742$3,217$3,281(Millions of Dollars)Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 vs. 2022Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 vs. 2022Revenue recognition for the Texas rate case surcharge (a)$(85)$(85)Conservation and demand side management (offset in expense)(18)(35)Estimated impact of weather (net of decoupling/sales true-up)(23)(33)PTCs flowed back to customers (offset by lower ETR)(11)(23)Regulatory rate outcomes (Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin and South Dakota) (b)(38)51Non-fuel riders1329Wholesale transmission (net)623Sales and demand (c)(1)22Other (net)(14)(13)Total decrease$(171)$(64)(a)The decline in electric margin is due to the recognition of the Texas rate case outcome in the second quarter of 2022, which was largely offset by recognition of previously deferred costs.(b)Decrease primarily relates to the Minnesota Electric Rate Case (approximately $60 million — see Note 4). Reduced electric margin was offset by corresponding reductions in depreciation expense, taxes (other than income taxes) and other items.(c)Sales excludes weather impact, net of partial decoupling in Colorado and sales true-up mechanism in Minnesota.Natural Gas Margin — Natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues.Natural gas expense varies with changing sales and the cost of natural gas. However, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas generally have minimal earnings impact due to cost recovery mechanisms.Natural gas revenues, cost of natural gas sold and transported and margin:Three Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 30(Millions of Dollars)2023202220232022Natural gas revenues$393$476$1,681$1,566Cost of natural gas sold and transported(170)(251)(1,014)(961)Natural gas margin$223$225$667$605(Millions of Dollars)Three MonthsEnded June 30,2023 vs. 2022Six MonthsEnded June 30,2023 vs. 2022Regulatory rate outcomes (Colorado and Wisconsin)$1$49Estimated impact of weather(5)5Infrastructure and integrity riders—4Other (net)24Total (decrease) increase$(2)$62O&amp;M Expenses — O&amp;M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter and $62 million year-to-date. The increase was primarily due to timing of planned generation outages; additional bad debt expenses; higher insurance and the impact of inflationary pressures, including labor increases, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Case in 2022 (approximately $16 million, offset in Electric revenues).Depreciation and Amortization — Depreciation and amortization decreased $73 million for the second quarter and $11 million year-to-date, largely related to the recognition of previously deferred depreciation costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Case in 2022 (approximately $40 million) and depreciation life extensions implemented in the Minnesota Electric Rate Case ($48 million), partially offset by system expansion.Taxes (other than Income Taxes) — Taxes decreased $42 million for the second quarter and $29 million year-to-date, primarily associated with the $25 million of deferrals related to the Minnesota Electric Rate Case and the recognition of previously deferred costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Case in 2022.Other Income (Expense) — Other income (expense) increased $17 million for the second quarter and $21 million year-to-date, largely related to rabbi trust performance, which is partially offset in O&amp;M expenses (employee benefit costs).Interest Charges — Interest charges increased $21 million for the second quarter and $60 million year-to-date, largely due to higher interest rates and increased long-term debt levels, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Case in 2022.Income Taxes — Effective income tax rate:Three Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 30202320222023 vs. 2022202320222023 vs. 2022Federal statutory rate21.0%21.0%—%21.0%21.0%—%State tax (net of federal tax effect)5.15.2(0.1)4.95.0(0.1)(Decreases) increases:Wind PTCs (a)(64.0)(48.3)(15.7)(44.1)(40.4)(3.7)Plant regulatory differences (b)(6.3)(5.5)(0.8)(5.8)(5.1)(0.7)Other tax credits, net operating loss &amp; tax credits allowances(1.4)(1.4)—(1.5)(1.5)—Other (net)1.6(0.1)1.70.5(0.2)0.7Effective income tax rate(44.0)%(29.1)%(14.9)%(25.0)%(21.2)%(3.8)%(a)Wind PTCs are credited to customers (reduction to revenue) and do not materially impact earnings.(b)Plant regulatory differences primarily relate to the credit of excess deferred taxes to customers through the average rate assumption method.

Rates, Regulation and OtherNSP-Minnesota — 2022 Minnesota Electric Rate Case — In October 2021, NSP-Minnesota filed a three-year electric rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC). The rate case is based on a requested ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and forward test years. In December 2021, the MPUC approved interim rates, subject to refund, of $247 million, effective Jan. 1, 2022. In November 2022, NSP-Minnesota revised its rate request to $498 million over three years.In March 2023, the ALJ’s report was issued, which included an estimated rate increase of approximately $386 million over three years from 2022-2024, based on a ROE of 9.87% and an equity ratio of 52.5%.In July 2023, the MPUC approved a three-year rate increase of approximately $311 million for 2022-2024, based on a ROE of 9.25% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The MPUC also approved a continuation of the sales true-up mechanism. NSP-Minnesota plans to file for reconsideration of the decision in August 2023. The MPUC will have 60 days to respond to the reconsideration request.Modifications to NSP-Minnesota’s request were as follows:(Millions of Dollars)202220232024NSP-Minnesota’s revised revenue request$233$328$498Sherco 3 and A.S.

The filing was based on a 2021 historic test year adjusted for certain known and measurable changes, a requested return on equity of 10.75%, rate base of approximately $947 million and an equity ratio of 53%.In June 2023, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) Staff approved an uncontested settlement agreement. Key terms of the decision include:Increase in base rate and infrastructure rider revenue of $14 million.Decreases in depreciation expense of $7 million (change in depreciable lives) and nuclear decommissioning expense of $5 million from NSP-Minnesota’s rate request.Confidential equity ratio and ROE.NSP-Minnesota Solar Request for Proposal (RFP) — In May 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a recommended portfolio, which proposed an additional 250 MW of self-build solar generation at the site of our retiring Sherco coal units and a 100 MW solar PPA located in Wisconsin as part of the resource plan RFP. A MPUC decision is expected later this year.NSP-Wisconsin — Wisconsin Rate Case — In April 2023, NSP-Wisconsin filed a Wisconsin rate case seeking an electric increase of $40 million (rate increase of 4.8%) and a natural gas increase of $9 million (rate increase of 5.3%). The rate request is based on a ROE of 10.25%, a 52.5% equity ratio and 2024 forward-looking test year. A final decision by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin is expected in late fourth quarter of 2023.PSCo — Electric Rate Case — In November 2022, PSCo filed a Colorado electric rate case seeking a net increase of $262 million, or 8.2%. The total request reflects a $312 million increase (subsequently adjusted to $303 million in rebuttal), which includes $50 million of authorized costs currently recovered through various rider mechanisms. The request is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.7% and a 2023 forecast test year with a 2023 average rate base of $11.3 billion.PSCo’s request for a 2023 Transmission Cost Adjustment (TCA) rider revenue requirement of $41 million has also been consolidated with the pending electric rate case.In June 2023, PSCo, the Staff, Utility Consumer Advocate, Colorado Energy Office, Colorado Energy Consumers and various other intervenors filed a nearly comprehensive settlement. The City of Boulder opposes the settlement. Terms of the settlement include:Retail revenue increase (excluding rider roll-ins) of $95 million (increase of 2.96%), based on a 2022 historic test year using year-end rate base with forward looking known and measurable adjustments.Alternatively, retail revenue increase (excluding rider roll-ins) of $47 million (increase of 1.46%), if depreciation expense deferrals associated with certain coal generating assets are accepted by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). This adjustment, if approved, would be earnings neutral, but reduce annual cash flow by $47 million.Weighted-average cost of capital of 6.95% (based on 55.69% equity ratio and 9.3% ROE).Early termination of the revenue decoupling pilot with implementation of new rates.Continuation of previously authorized trackers and deferrals.Collection of $12 million of 2023 TCA revenues, previously suspended by the CPUC. Intervenors’ recommended adjustments to the TCA, including prudency tests, exclusion of repair or replacement projects and a historic test year, are subject to CPUC review and any changes to the TCA would apply prospectively beginning in 2024.A CPUC decision is expected in the third quarter of 2023, with rates to be effective in September 2023.SPS — 2022 New Mexico Electric Rate Case — In November 2022, Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a revenue increase of $78 million, or 10%. In May 2023, SPS revised its request to $75 million. The request is based on a ROE of 10.75%, an equity ratio of 54.7%, a future test year ending June 30, 2024, rate base of $2.4 billion and acceleration of the Tolk coal plant depreciation life from 2032 to 2028.In May 2023, SPS, Staff, and various parties filed a contested comprehensive stipulation. Two environmental advocacy organizations opposed the stipulation. However, one intervenor withdrew their opposition and abstained. Hearings were held in June 2023. Terms of the contested stipulation include:Base rate revenue increase of $33 million, based on the filed future test year.ROE of 9.5%.Equity ratio of 54.7%.Acceleration of Tolk coal plant depreciation life to 2028.A New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) decision is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2023.SPS — 2023 Texas Electric Rate Case — In February 2023, SPS filed a Texas electric rate case seeking an increase in base rate revenue of $149 million (13%). In March 2023, SPS updated the filing, which increased the rate revenue request to $158 million (14% impact to customer bills). The request is based on a ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% and retail rate base of $3.6 billion. Additionally, the request reflects the acceleration of the Tolk coal plant depreciation life from 2034 to 2028. SPS is requesting a surcharge from July 13, 2023 through the effective date of new base rates.Next steps in the procedural schedule are as follows:Intervenor direct testimony: August 4, 2023.Staff direct testimony: August 11, 2023.Rebuttal testimony: August 25, 2023.Hearings: Sept. 12-21, 2023.Proposed findings: Oct. 25, 2023.A Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) decision is expected in the first quarter of 2024.SPS RFP — In July 2023, SPS filed a recommended portfolio, which includes 418 MW of self-build solar projects. A decision from PUCT and NMPRC is expected in 2024.Note 5. Marshall Wildfire LitigationIn December 2021, a wildfire ignited in Boulder County, Colorado (the ""Marshall Fire""), which burned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. On June 8, 2023, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office released its Marshall Fire Investigative Summary and Review and its supporting documents (the ""Sheriff’s Report""). According to an October 2022 statement from the Colorado Insurance Commissioner, the Marshall Fire is estimated to have caused more than $2 billion in property losses.According to the Sheriff’s Report, on Dec. 30, 2021, a fire ignited on a residential property in Boulder, Colorado, located in PSCo’s service territory, for reasons unrelated to PSCo’s power lines. According to the Sheriff’s Report, approximately one hour and 20 minutes after the first ignition, a second fire ignited just south of the Marshall Mesa Trailhead in unincorporated Boulder County, Colorado, also located in PSCo’s service territory. According to the Sheriff’s Report, the second ignition started approximately 80 to 110 feet away from PSCo’s power lines in the area.The Sheriff’s Report states that the most probable cause of the second ignition was hot particles discharged from PSCo’s power lines after one of the power lines detached from its insulator in strong winds, and further states that it cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an underground coal fire. According to the Sheriff’s Report, no design, installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies were identified on PSCo’s electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. PSCo disputes that its power lines caused the second ignition.As of July 24, 2023, PSCo is aware of approximately eight complaints on behalf of at least 586 plaintiffs relating to the Marshall Fire and expects that it may receive further complaints. The complaints generally allege that PSCo’s equipment ignited the Marshall Fire and assert various causes of action under Colorado law, including negligence, premises liability, trespass, nuisance, and inverse condemnation.Colorado courts do not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company’s liability for fire-related damages. For inverse condemnation claims, Colorado courts assess whether a defendant acted with intent to take a plaintiff’s property or intentionally took an action which has the natural consequence of taking the property. For negligence claims, Colorado courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their system with a heightened duty of care consistent with the practical conduct of its business, and liability does not extend to occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated. Under Colorado law, in a civil action other than a medical malpractice action, the total award for noneconomic loss is capped at $0.6 million for claims that accrued at the time of the Marshall Fire unless the court finds justification to exceed that amount by clear and convincing evidence, in which case the maximum doubles. Colorado law does not impose joint and several liability in tort actions. Instead, under Colorado law, a defendant is liable for the degree or percentage of the negligence or fault attributable to that defendant, except where the defendant conspired with another defendant. A jury’s verdict in a Colorado civil case must be unanimous.Colorado law caps punitive or exemplary damages to an amount equal to the amount of the actual damages awarded to the injured party, except the court may increase any award of punitive damages to a sum up to three times the amount of actual damages if the conduct that is the subject of the claim has continued during the pendency of the case or the defendant has acted in a willful and wanton manner during the action which further aggravated plaintiff’s damages.In the event Xcel Energy Inc. or PSCo was found liable related to this litigation and were required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, due to uncertainty as to the cause of the fire and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, Xcel Energy Inc. and PSCo are unable to estimate the amount or range of possible losses in connection with the Marshall Fire.Note 6. Earnings Guidance and Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate ObjectivesXcel Energy 2023 Earnings Guidance — Xcel Energy’s 2023 GAAP and ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share.(a)Key assumptions as compared with 2022 levels unless noted:Constructive outcomes in all pending rate case and regulatory proceedings.Normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year.Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~1%.Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to be relatively flat.Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $40 million to $50 million (net of PTCs). The change from the previous estimate is largely due to a change in the projected levels of PTCs driven by a change in the PTC rate, which are offset in the ETR and largely earnings neutral.O&amp;M expenses are projected to decline ~3%.Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $30 million to $40 million. The change from the previous estimate is largely due to longer depreciation lives approved in the Minnesota Electric Rate Case and other regulatory decisions, which are generally offset by lower revenue.Property taxes are projected to decrease $20 million to $30 million. The change from the previous estimate is largely due to regulatory decisions, which are generally offset by lower revenue.Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $80 million to $90 million. The change from the previous estimate is largely due to regulatory decisions (generally offset by lower revenue) and lower than projected interest rates on recent bond issuances.AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $0 million to $10 million.ETR is projected to be ~(9%) to (11%). The change from the previous estimate is largely due to a change in the projected levels of PTCs and a change in the PTC rate, which are offset in the capital riders and fuel mechanisms and are largely earnings neutral.(a)Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management’s view, not reflective of ongoing operations.

When investing in dividend stocks, seasoned investors pay attention to growth in their payouts over the years. Through this, they aim to benefit through a combination of growing income stream, capital appreciation, and protection against inflation. Returns of dividend growth stocks have surpassed those without any growth tracks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned RMB Capital’s research which revealed that dividend growers achieved a positive return of 9.62% from 1972 until December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79% during the same period.According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers exhibited lower volatility over the last 50 years. Due to this, many financial experts are now recommending the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental part of equity portfolios for their clients. The consistent growth and stability of dividends make them an attractive option for investors seeking reliable long-term returns. From 1973 to 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return to shareholders, whereas dividend payers and dividend non-payers returned 9.18% and -0.60%, respectively.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Fomento Economico has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Monster Beverage has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This means that FMX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.FMX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.85, while MNST has a forward P/E of 37.76.

(NYSE:LUV)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-southwest-airlines-120351719.html,1690459431,STORY,['LUV'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Southwest Airlines’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines What Is Southwest Airlines Worth?Southwest Airlines appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Southwest Airlines’s ratio of 32.79x is above its peer average of 23.08x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Airlines industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Southwest Airlines’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Southwest Airlines generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Southwest Airlines. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? LUV’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe LUV should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on LUV for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for LUV, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

116,27e83e67-1e00-3cc1-a8f4-3d91e110c143,LUV,2023-07-27,"Southwest Airlines made $683 million in Q2, as a hectic summer travel season led to record revenue",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-made-683-million-113515632.html,1690457715,STORY,['LUV'],"[DALLAS (AP) — Southwest Airlines said second-quarter earnings dropped 10% to $683 million as labor costs soared, offsetting record revenue at the start of the peak summer travel season.The airline also warned Thursday that a key revenue ratio will drop and non-fuel costs will rise in the third quarter.The shares fell nearly 9% to close at $33.02, the stocks' worst one-day percentage decline since June 2020, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic crippled air travel.Southwest said that revenue for every seat flown one mile — a closely watched ratio in the airline business — fell 8.3% in the second quarter and will drop by between 3% and 7% in the third quarter, compared with the same periods last year.That outlook “will amplify concerns around slowing domestic air travel demand,” said Cowen airline analyst Helane Becker.A report earlier this week from Alaska Airlines fanned worries that demand for air travel — especially within the United States — might finally be cooling after recovering strongly from the pandemic. Southwest and Alaska both operate mostly domestic flights, and they are benefitting less than bigger rivals Delta, United and American from the boom in international flying.Southwest CEO Robert Jordan sought to assure the market, saying that more than half of the decline in the second-quarter revenue ratio could be explained by additional money that Southwest booked a year ago. Southwest recognized revenue based on the expectation that some pandemic-era vouchers and credits would not be used before they expired. Southwest has since said vouchers won't expire, and that caused a $300 million hit to revenue in this year's second quarter, the CEO said.Jordan said demand is still strong, and the airline is 70% booked for the third quarter — ahead of where it would normally be in late July.The average one-way fare on Southwest dropped nearly 3% compared with last summer, to $179.44. Jordan said, however, that fares actually rose 2% after excluding the revenue Southwest recognized last year from unused vouchers.Story continuesSouthwest and other airlines are trying to adapt to changes in travel habits since the pandemic. Business travel has yet to recover, causing airlines to tweak their schedules to attract more leisure flyers. Southwest is scheduling more long flights, and it is reducing early-morning and late-night flights.The second-quarter results from Dallas-based Southwest, which were aided by lower fuel prices, beat analyst expectations. The company predicted record revenue and another profit in the third quarter, but warned of higher non-fuel costs.Southwest is locked in drawn-out negotiations with pilots and flight attendants, who have not received pay raises in several years. Unions are aiming to match higher wages won by counterparts at other major U.S. airlines, including up to 40% more pay over four years at United.“It's a great time to be negotiating as a pilot,” Jordan told CNBC.Southwest struggled with a shortage of pilots as travel began recovering last year, but Jordan said it will soon be caught up. He vowed to match industry pay scales.The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association says more people are quitting. Southwest officials conceded the union's point, but said it's because the hot job market for pilots has led some of them to job-hop.“It's a record year for our pilot hiring. It's also a record year for pilot attrition,” Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson said on a call with analysts and reporters. “We do see some people come and leave right away.”Southwest said it still expects to hit its target of adding 1,700 net pilot jobs this year.Southwest's profit fell from $760 million a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings per share were $1.09, matching the mean forecast in a FactSet survey of analysts.Revenue rose 5% to a quarterly record of $7.04 billion, topping the $6.98 billion prediction of analysts.Southwest's labor costs rose 25.5% from a year earlier, an increase of more than $500 million, and the airline said third-quarter non-fuel costs would rise by 3.5% to 6.5% for each seat flown one mile, mostly in anticipation of higher wages.Southwest Airlines Co. spent 14% less on fuel than a year earlier, a savings of more than $200 million, because of lower prices.___This story has been corrected to show that analysts in a FactSet survey expected Southwest to earn $1.09 per share, not 99 cents per share.]"

Powell said that the FOMC will be particularly focused on the inflation data, and we expect the next few CPI reports to be soft,"" said David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, in a note.Story continuesOn tap on the economic front, the Commerce Department is set to report that the U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.8% annualized rate last quarter, in its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP growth.At 7:01 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 48 points, or 0.13%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 26 points, or 0.57%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 186 points, or 1.19%.Netflix climbed 0.8% after a report that it was restructuring its advertising partnership with Microsoft for its lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan and also cutting ad prices.EBay forecast third-quarter profit below market expectations as the e-commerce platform spent more to bolster categories such as auto parts, refurbished goods and collectibles, sending its shares down 5.3%.Chipmakers including Nvidia, Micron and Marvell Technology rose between 2% and 4% after Lam Research forecast upbeat quarterly sales. Shares of Lam rose 3.3%.Universal banks including Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America crept higher between 0.2% and 0.6%, ahead of a rule that U.S. regulators are set to unveil later in the day that could significantly raise capital requirements for the lenders.Southwest Airlines tumbled 6.9% after the airline warned of higher labor costs for the year and posted a dip in second-quarter profit.

Meanwhile, it expects a jump in labor expense to drive up its non-fuel operating costs this year.Southwest attributed the decline in RASM to a tough year-on-year comparison as resumption of travel after the pandemic amid limited flights had sent airfares soaring last year.Earlier this week, domestic leisure carrier Alaska Air Group had also warned of a decline in pricing power in the current quarter from a year ago, saying surging international travel demand had also led to a drop in domestic travel.""We expect shares of Southwest (as well as the other domestically focused carriers) to continue to trade down near term as its results will amplify concerns around slowing domestic air travel demand,"" TD Cowen analysts said in a note.Southwest executives, however, said leisure travel demand remains resilient and is expected to generate ""record"" revenue for the company in the September quarter.On an earnings call, Chief Commercial Officer Ryan Green said Southwest had an ""all-time record"" fare sale last month for travel this autumn.The company, however, is wrestling with ever-changing travel patterns.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head directly to the 5 Biggest Marijuana Companies in the World.An Analysis of the Cannabis IndustryAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global cannabis market was worth $43.72 billion in 2022. The industry is expected to reach a valuation of $57.18 billion by the end of 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 34.03% to a value of $444.34 billion by 2030.The United States was one of the first countries to legalize the medicinal use of cannabis. Colorado and Washington were among the first to legalize the use of marijuana in 2012. This explains why North America dominated the global cannabis market and accounted for $35.67 billion of the industry's market value in 2022. According to Reuters, as of 2023, 23 states across the United States have legalized the use of cannabis for recreational purposes. Regional trends suggest that Canada is an emerging powerhouse for cannabis companies, attributable to rapid legalization and wide public acceptance. When we look outside the US and North American region, Europe is expected to be the second-fastest growing region when it comes to the medicinal use of cannabis products. The Asia Pacific region is also forecasted to undergo significant growth as part of changing government policies related to the medicinal use of cannabis. In June 2022, the government of Thailand lifted bans on the cultivation, production, and sale of cannabis. Moreover, identifying the therapeutic benefits of marijuana, Germany, Finland, and Israel have permitted the medicinal use of cannabis on a larger scale.A Potential Major Player EmergesOn July 20, Forbes reported Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is attempting to acquire Syqe Medical for an estimated $650 million, an Israel-based cannabis company. This step will be a catalyst for the medical and cannabis industry. Upon successful completion of the clinical trials, the acquisition will take place, potentially placing Syqe Medical among the top 10 marijuana companies in the world.Story continuesThe company's product is a pain reduction inhaler backed by raw medical cannabis rather than its processed versions. Additionally, with its unique and innovative features, the inhaler suggests an appropriate dosage for each patient. First-world countries such as Canada have approved the inhaler for medical use. However, the product is yet to be marketed for sale. The acquisition by Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) will be a game changer for Syqe Medical and the global medical community.Product InnovationSince the legalization of cannabis, companies traditionally specializing in medicinal-based cannabis products have begun to cater to the regular customer. These customers tend to use cannabis for recreational purposes and are constantly evolving or employing innovative techniques. For example, people are no longer limiting their use of cannabis to smoking flowers with joints. Consumers incorporate vapes, topicals, and various infused products into their lifestyles. These trends allow existing cannabis companies to enhance their product portfolio and penetrate potential markets.Large companies like Jushi Holdings (JUSH.CN), the Green Thumb Industries (OTC:GTBIF), and CuraLeaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF) now offer vapes, flowers, edibles, disposables, cartridges, and conventional medicinal products. Conventionally, these companies operate in the healthcare industry. However, companies have diversified their product portfolio to keep up with changing trends. While such actions may be profitable, experts tend to assess the health risks associated with the use of cannabis.Major Companies in the Marijuana IndustrySome of the biggest marijuana companies in the world making leaps in innovative medicine include Curaleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF), Tilray Brands, Inc (NASDAQ:TLRY), and Green Thumb Industries, Inc (OTC:GTBIF).Curleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF) is the biggest marijuana company in the world. The company is an industry leader, pioneering the cultivation, production, and sale of cannabis in the United States.

Tilray Brands, Inc (NASDAQ: TLRY) specializes in the research, cultivation, production, and distribution of cannabis-based medical products in the United States. As of July 24, Tilray Brands, Inc (NASDAQ:TLRY) has surged 21.36% over the past month.Another big name in the marijuana industry is Green Thumb Industries, Inc (OTC:GTBIF).

In fiscal 2022, Green Thumb Industries, Inc (OTC:GTBIF) generated a revenue of $1 billion, up 14% year over year.26 Biggest Marijuana Companies in the WorldPhoto by terre-di-cannabis on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list, we considered public and private companies operating in the marijuana industry. We used the market cap as of July 25 to quantify the size of public companies. For private companies, we relied on their annual revenue for the most recent fiscal year, or any other quantitative metric that can justify their size. We sourced our data from three credible sources including Yahoo Finance, Crunchbase, and Forbes.Market cap was prioritized as the metric for quantifying a company's size, so private companies are ranked earlier in the list. As we move up, we will find public companies.Please note that all companies mentioned in our rankings are pure-play marijuana companies and so you may not find companies that have some, or indirect, exposure to the marijuana industry.26 Biggest Marijuana Companies in the World26.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Zack Moxcey: Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President, and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we used a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to page two. We begin with our safe harbor statement.During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to page three. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.Story continuesAnd now, if you please turn to page four, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?Neil Hunn: [Technical Difficulty] and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We’re looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning, which like Q1 were quite good. As we turn to page four, let's look at today's agenda. I'll start with our second quarter enterprise highlights then ask Jason to share our financial results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to page five, the four main takeaways for today's call are: first, we continue to perform extremely well and had a very strong second quarter, another demonstration of the quality of our portfolio of businesses.Second, we're increasing our full-year guidance both in terms of total and organic revenue growth and adjusted debts. Third, Generative AI. We're very excited by the promise of this technology and outline reasons why today. And fourth, we remain very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment. As it relates to the first takeaway, a strong start to the year and a solid second quarter, we saw total revenue grow 17% and organic revenue grow 9%. Consistent with our longstanding strategy we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 17% in the quarter. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose built to consistently perform at a very high level.Given the strong second quarter, we're increasing our full-year total revenue growth to be around 13%, increasing our organic revenue growth to be around 7% and increasing our full-year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 to $16.50 or up $0.23 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Third, relative to Gen AI, we feel we're structurally advantaged and excited by this technology as our vertical and application specific businesses, we use our specialized market positions and knowledge to provide context to these enabling technologies both to create customer value and internal productivity gains more on this during today's call. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain active in the market as we evaluate and actively diligence many high quality opportunities.Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our second quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil, and I hope everyone is doing well this morning. Turning to slide six, the seconf quarter was another good post in 2023. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, which was up 17% over prior year. Organic growth was 9%, which was led by 8% software recurring revenue growth across the enterprise and outsized growth 19% in our tech enable product segment. EBITDA increased 20% to $617 million with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. Notably, margin expanded across all three segments in the quarter. DEPS of $4.12 was $0.12 above the high-end of our guidance range and 20% above prior year. DEPS growth was in line with EBITDA growth given the offsetting impact of a higher tax rate and lower net interest expense. Moving to free cash flow.As a reminder, the second quarter is always our lowest conversion quarter in the year as we make two federal tax payments. We delivered $295 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up 17% over prior year. As I previously mentioned, Frontline’s cash flow is seasonally weighted to Q3 and Q4, especially in Q3 and this is in line with our K-12 customers' annual renewals. So we expect a meaningful increase to cash flow in the second half. Taking broader view of cash flow on this slide, recall that we acquired Vertafore in 2020 and had a one-time cash tax benefit of $120 million, of which about $60 million benefited the second quarter of 2021. We've therefore had very strong multi-year cash flow performance when normalizing for this 2021 tax item.For the year, we are confident that free cash flow will be greater than 30% of revenue. Turning to our balance sheet on slide seven. Our net leverage sits at 2.2 times at the end of the quarter with about $6.7 billion of debt and just under $1.5 billion of cash against our TTM EBITDA of $2.35 million. Also our $3.5 billion revolver remains fully undrawn. To summarize, we have significant acquisition capacity and remain quite active in many bespoke processes. To that end, in Q3, we expect to close on Replicon, which is a bolt-on acquisition for our Deltek business with a purchase price of $450 million or about $370 million net of a long-term cash tax benefit. Neil will discuss the details around this exciting addition to the Deltek platform in the segment discussion.So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?software, support, workchristina-wocintechchat-com-FVgECvTjlBQ-unsplashNeil Hunn: Thanks, Jason. Let's turn to page nine and walk through our Q2 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $770 million, up 6% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 43.7% in the quarter. In this segment, we continue to see consistently strong performance across the entire group of companies. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was once again solid across both our government contracting and private sector businesses. Importantly, Deltek continues to see momentum build with our SaaS offerings and retention rates remain at historically high levels. Also in the quarter and as Jason mentioned earlier, we announced the acquisition of Replicon for Deltek, Roper’s largest bolt-on today.Replicon is a market leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and it's highly complementary to Deltek strategy. We expect Replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year and we expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Finally, as it relates to Deltek, we wanted to brag on them for a moment. During the quarter, the Washington Post award Deltek, the number four top workplace at the D.C. Metro Area for large companies. As you know, we have a closely held belief that talent and culture can create long-term competitive advantage and this is certainly the case for Deltek. During Roper's ownership with Deltek, the company has increased its organic growth rate, retention levels, recurring revenue and margin structure and a big contributor to that success is the structural talent advantage that Deltek continues to build.Congrats to Mike and congrats to your entire team. Aderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms continues to be excellent. In the quarter, Aderant saw record bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly during the quarter, Aderant launched their Generative AI enabler, MADDI. Today, MADDI is enabling two solutions outside counsel guidelines management and time entry, with plans to extend this to AR cash receipt matching and docketing over the coming months. Over time MADDI will be integrated widely across Aderant’s product platforms. Generative AI for a legal space has tremendous potential. One such example in the market today is Onyx. Onyx powered by MADDI solves a massive challenge that all law firms face, namely how to navigate outside counsel guidelines or the billing requirements that clients impose on their law firms.It's fairly common for a large law firm to have to navigate 100s of 1,000s of bespoke client billing requirements. Today, Onyx uses Generative AI to extract contractual terms and convert them into business tools used in the time entry and billing processes, a true game changer. More broadly across Roper, we're excited about the potential of Generative AI and large language models. We believe given our deeply verticalized and application specific business model that our businesses are structurally advantaged given that all AI, computational and generative need context specifically dated workflows and wish to train or target the technology. Internally, we're working closely with our businesses on the productivity and product enabled opportunities associated with Gen AI.Certainly much more to come on this. Now back to the segment performance in Vertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies. Vertafore continues to be a great asset for us with solid performance across our core P&amp;C business and their recent MGA Solutions bolt-on. Our Healthcare/IT businesses also performed very well in the quarter with growth in each of our Healthcare/IT franchises, Clinisys, Data Innovations and Strata. Frontline also continues to deliver for us. Frontline's mission is to empower the frontline of education. As many of you know, the hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging and frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school district to navigate these challenges.Because of this, frontline solutions are mission critical and of high importance to their school district customers. As such, frontline's net retention is consistently strong. Looking to the second-half of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digits area for the segment. Overall, very strong results and outlook for this segment. Turning to page 10. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $358 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.2%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was solid across the segment. Relative to business specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT &amp; Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets.I'll remind you that our businesses are critical to the operation and execution of the North American spot freight market. In addition and importantly the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future great ships. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle DAT &amp; Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet. As we speak, DAT is launching a Generative AI enabled solution among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud. This is in addition to their existing set of computational AI and data science driven solutions like DAT iQ, which they deploy at scale over the last three or four years. By pipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities had very nice ARR gains in the quarter driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity.Foundry continued its string of strong performance and had terrific growth for their flagship product Nuke, which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke and the first-half of the year had north of 60% of their new units sold under their new model ahead of their transition plan. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses led by SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid and the business has benefited by an improving census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the second-half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on sustained ARR momentum.As we turn to page 11, revenues in the quarter for our tech-enabled product segment were $403 million, up 19% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were strong at 36.4% for the quarter. Across this segment, business performance and execution was exceptional. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continued to ease. Neptune, our water meter, and technology product business continues to be great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete. Given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers’ budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles.Verathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across their reoccurring single use products, both Bronchoscope or B-Flex and video innovation or GlideScope, as well as bladder scan capital purchases. Northern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter setting a record revenue for the business. A group of smaller businesses here, IPA, rf IDEAS and Inovonics were fantastic in the quarter as they substantially work through a series of nagging supply chain challenges. Relative to the second-half of the year, we expect to see high-single-digit organic revenue growth. Recall, we have a tough Q3 revenue and margin comp to lap from the prior year.Now please turn to page 13, and let's review our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter performance, we're raising our full-year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue, and adjusted DEPS. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be around 13%, an increase from 12% plus last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full-year organic revenue outlook to be in the 7% zip codes, an increase from 6% to 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 and $16.50, up for our prior guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Assumed in this guidance is a tax rate trending to the high-end our 21% to 22% range. Specific to the third quarter, we're establishing our debt guidance to be in the range of $4.16 and $4.20.Now please turn with us to page 14, and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same four points with which we started. First, the year started strong and we delivered solid second quarter results. In the quarter, we saw revenues increased 17% to $1.53 billion. This growth was underpinned with 9% organic revenue growth and 8% organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were quite strong at 40.3%. Second, based on the strong second quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we're increasing our full-year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full-year DEPS outlook to be between $16.36 and $16.50.Third, we're excited by the potential of Generative AI, both as it relates to internal productivity and using our application specificity to provide context for new product development ideas. We look forward to sharing progress and updates in coming quarters and years. And finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&amp;A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several months, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital. Now as we turn to your questions and if you flip to the final slide our strategic flywheel, we'll want to once again thank those of you who joined us in New York for our first ever Investor Day and for the 100s who have watched the replay over the past few months.During that long form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high quality nature of our portfolio of businesses; our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions.See also Tom Russo Net Worth, Performance and Portfolio and 11 Best Recession Dividend Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Argentinian inflation benefited revenue by approximately three percentage points. A revenue increase in Iraq was partially offset by investments in the Company’s ‘Evolve 2025’ strategy.""Our progress continued into the second quarter, with strong results that exceeded our expectations,"" said Devin McGranahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Union. ""Growth in our C2C transactions was the highest since 2021, primarily driven by our branded digital go-to-market program. We also experienced an increase in revenue from Iraq arising from prior changes in Iraqi monetary policies.""McGranahan added, ""These results reflect the advancement of our ‘Evolve 2025’ strategy and demonstrate continued momentum building across channels and geographies.""GAAP EPS in the second quarter was $0.47 compared to $0.50 in the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower operating profit, including costs related to the Company’s operating expense redeployment program in the current period. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was $0.51 and flat compared to the prior year period, with the current year period benefiting from a lower share count and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower pre-tax profit.Story continuesQ2 Business ResultsC2C revenues grew 4% on a reported basis, or 5% constant currency, while transactions increased 4% compared to the prior year period. Regionally, revenue growth was driven by MEASA, due to Iraq, LACA, and sequential improvements in Europe &amp; CIS, North America, and APAC.Branded digital revenue declined 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, and represented 21% and 28% of total C2C revenues and transactions, respectively. Transactions accelerated and grew 12% in the quarter driven by the Company’s updated go-to-market strategy.On July 1, 2023, the Company completed the third and final closing of its Business Solutions business, which included the European Union operations. The gain associated with the final closing, continues to be subject to regulatory capital adjustments. All cash consideration was received at the first closing.Q2 Financial ResultsGAAP operating margin in the quarter was 20.7%, compared to 23.2% in the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin was 21.8% compared to 23.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in the adjusted operating margin was primarily due to currency impacts, higher incentive compensation, higher variable costs, and investments related to the Company’s ‘Evolve 2025’ strategy, partially offset by lower marketing spend and net savings related to the Company’s operating expense redeployment program.The GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.6%, compared to 17.9% in the prior year period. The adjusted effective tax rate was 16.0% in the quarter, compared to 16.9% in the prior year period.Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities was $264 million, including a $119 million transition tax payment in the second quarter related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company returned $88 million to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends.2023 OutlookToday, the Company raised its 2023 full-year revenue and EPS outlook due primarily to business performance in Iraq. The outlook assumes no material changes in macroeconomic conditions, including changes in foreign currencies or Argentinian inflation.The 2023 outlook is as follows:Revised 2023 OutlookPrevious 2023 OutlookGAAPAdjustedGAAPAdjustedRevenue1(5%) to (3%)(1%) to 1%(9%) to (7%)(4%) to (2%)Operating Margin18% to 20%19% to 21%18% to 20%19% to 21%EPS$1.63 to $1.73$1.65 to $1.75$1.53 to $1.63$1.55 to $1.651 Adjusted revenue excludes currency impact, Argentinian Inflation, and Business SolutionsThe Company has been in regular discussions with policymakers in both the U.S. and Iraq about the elevated remittance volumes flowing through its network in Iraq during the second quarter. Due to recent U.S. government actions, including those announced on July 19, 2023, impacting fourteen Iraqi banks, some of whom were the Company’s agents, the ongoing and future application of the Company’s own compliance and risk controls, and future regulatory and policy changes, the Company expects these volumes to be significantly lower going forward. As a result, the Company has not included any of the elevated remittance volume from Iraq in its outlook after July.Non-GAAP MeasuresWestern Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the ""Investor Relations"" section of the Company’s website at https://ir.westernunion.com.GAAP figures reflect an expected partial year of Business Solutions ownership, including contractual payments to the buyers, representing profits between the first and third closings. Adjusted constant currency revenue growth metrics exclude contributions from Business Solutions. Adjusted operating profit metrics exclude the following items, as applicable: contributions from Business Solutions, operating expense redeployment program costs, acquisition and separation costs, and Russia and Belarus exit costs. Adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted earnings per share metrics exclude the following items and the related taxes, as applicable: Business Solutions gain, operating expense redeployment program costs, acquisition and separation costs, Russia and Belarus exit costs, and the reversal of significant uncertain tax positions.Additional StatisticsAdditional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release. All amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted.

A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with the Company’s GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review the Company’s financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below, where not previously reconciled above.Notes2Q223Q224Q22FY20221Q232Q23YTD 2Q23Consolidated Metrics(a)Revenues (GAAP)$1,138.3$1,089.6$1,091.9$4,475.5$1,036.9$1,170.0$2,206.9Foreign currency translation impact(i)42.160.849.4185.535.240.675.8Revenues, constant currency (non-GAAP)1,180.41,150.41,141.34,661.01,072.11,210.62,282.7Less Business Solutions revenues, constant currency (non-GAAP)(i), (l)(40.1)(50.4)(34.0)(216.4)(16.0)(13.9)(29.9)Adjusted revenues (non-GAAP)$1,140.3$1,100.0$1,107.3$4,444.6$1,056.1$1,196.7$2,252.8Prior year revenues (GAAP)$1,289.7$1,286.3$1,284.8$5,070.8$1,155.7$1,138.3$2,294.0Less prior year revenues from Business Solutions (GAAP)(l)(99.3)(116.8)(109.2)(421.8)(89.1)(35.7)(124.8)Adjusted prior year revenues (non-GAAP)$1,190.4$1,169.5$1,175.6$4,649.0$1,066.6$1,102.6$2,169.2Revenues (GAAP) -

EBITDA results provide an additional performance measurement calculation which helps neutralize the operating income effect of assets acquired in prior periods.(k)Represents the impact from expenses incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition and divestiture activity, including for the review and closing of these transactions. Also includes costs associated with the divestiture of the Business Solutions business, primarily related to severance and non-cash impairments of property and equipment and an operating lease right-of-use asset.(l)During 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Business Solutions business to Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC (collectively, the ""Buyer""). The sale was completed in three closings, the first of which occurred on March 1, 2022 with the entirety of the cash consideration collected at that time and allocated to the closings on a relative fair value basis. The first closing excluded the operations in the European Union and the United Kingdom and resulted in a gain of $151.4 million. The second closing, which included the United Kingdom operations, occurred on December 31, 2022 and resulted in a gain of $96.9 million. The final closing, which included the European Union operations, occurred on July 1, 2023, and the gain associated with the final closing that will be recognized in Q3 2023 will be subject to regulatory capital adjustments. Revenues have been adjusted to exclude the carved out financial information for the Business Solutions business to compare the year-over-year changes and trends in the Company's continuing businesses, excluding the effects of this divestiture. While the sale of the Company's Business Solutions business does not qualify for or represent discontinued operations, the Company has also adjusted operating income, beginning in the first quarter of 2022 and concurrent with the sale, to exclude the carved out direct profit of the Business Solutions business. The operations of the Business Solutions business sold in the final closing continued to be included in Revenues and Operating income after the second closing. However, between the first and final closings, the Company was required to pay the Buyer a measure of the profits from these operations, while owned by the Company, adjusted for other charges, and this expense was recognized in Other expense, net. Therefore, the Company believes that providing this information enhances investors' understanding of the profitability of the Company's remaining businesses. The Company has also excluded the gain on the sale, net of related taxes, from its results.(m)Represents the exit costs incurred in connection with the Company's suspension of its operations in Russia and Belarus primarily related to severance and non-cash impairments of property and equipment, an operating lease right-of-use asset, and other intangible assets.(n)Represents non-cash reversals of significant uncertain tax positions. While the Company continues to reverse its uncertain tax positions upon settlements with taxing authorities, the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations, and other events, the Company has excluded certain reversals of uncertain tax positions in the third and fourth quarter of 2022 because of the significance of these reversals on its reported results.(o)Represents severance, expenses associated with streamlining the Company's organizational and legal structure, and other expenses associated with the Company's program to redeploy expenses in its cost base through optimizations in vendor management, real estate, marketing, and people strategy as previously announced in October 2022. Previous expenses incurred under the program included non-cash impairments of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. The expenses are not included in the measurement of segment operating income provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.Other notes:(aa)Geographic split for transactions and revenue, including transactions initiated digitally, as earlier defined, is determined entirely based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated.(bb)Represents the North America (United States and Canada) (""NA"") region of the Company's Consumer-to-Consumer segment.(cc)Represents the Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (""EU &amp; CIS"") region of the Company's Consumer-to-Consumer segment.(dd)Represents the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (""MEASA"") region of the Company's Consumer-to-Consumer segment, including India and certain South Asian countries, which consist of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.(ee)Represents the Latin America and the Caribbean (""LACA"") region of the Company’s Consumer-to-Consumer segment, including Mexico.(ff)Represents the East Asia and Oceania (""APAC"") region of the Company’s Consumer-to-Consumer segment.(gg)Represents transactions conducted and funded through websites and mobile applications marketed under the Company’s brands (""Branded Digital"").View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726081191/en/ContactsMedia Relations: Claire Treacymedia@westernunion.com Investor Relations: Tom HadleyWesternUnion.IR@westernunion.com]"

Carey and American Homes 4 Rent",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-cushman-090000113.html,1690448400,STORY,"['SPG', 'EQR', 'AMH', 'WPC', 'CWK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 27, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. ETFs recently featured in the blog include: Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK, Simon Property Group SPG, Equity Residential EQR, W. P. Carey WPC and American Homes 4 Rent AMH.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 REITs Likely to Beat on Earnings This QuarterThe second-quarter reporting cycle is underway, and investors can be lured by the profits of companies that have already released their quarterly figures. However, rather than adding the stock later to your portfolio, accumulating the ones poised to beat estimates can generate higher gains. This is because an earnings beat usually serves as a catalyst, raising investors’ confidence in the stock and resulting in price appreciation. This is likely to be reflected in the earnings releases of Simon Property Group, Equity Residential, W. P. Carey and American Homes 4 Rent.Moreover, rather than fretting too much about the Fed's rate hikes, focusing on REITs will be a smart move. This is because with the industry offering the real estate structure for several economic activities, be it real or virtual, there are pockets of strength even in a challenging environment.For example, for REITs dealing with industrial real estate, we note that the U.S. industrial real estate sector, while exhibiting signs of normalization following the extraordinary demand spike during the pandemic, continues to project healthy fundamentals. Per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report, net absorption for the second quarter measuring 44.9 million square feet (msf) marks a drop from the heights of the previous year. However, it is still in line with healthy pre-pandemic absorption levels. Leasing activity too mirrors this trend amid economic challenges. While the gross new leasing of 141.1 msf is down 8.9% from the first quarter, it is still in line with the quarterly average experienced from 2015 to 2019.Story continuesThe second quarter saw a swift influx of new industrial supply, with a staggering 139.5 msf of new developments reaching completion. Amid this, the national vacancy rate increased by 60 basis points to 4.1%, surpassing the 4% mark for the first time since mid-2021. Despite the rise, the vacancy rate remains well below the 10-year average, suggesting a resilient market. Yet, despite softening market conditions, rents continued to rise. Second-quarter asking rental rates increased by 4.6% quarter over quarter, pushing the figure to $9.59 per square foot (psf).In the case of the retail REITs, we note that according to a CWK report, the U.S. retail real estate market has continued to exhibit remarkable strength in the second quarter of 2023 despite uncertainties in the economic outlook and notable bankruptcies. The second quarter of 2023 witnessed a ninth consecutive quarter of positive net absorption in the retail market, totaling 7.1 msf nationally. The pace of absorption accelerated significantly compared to the first quarter, coming close to the average rate of the past year. New retail construction has remained subdued in the second quarter of 2023, with only 2 msf of space delivered nationwide.The vacancy rate has dropped to 5.4% in the second quarter, down 60 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 and 80 basis points lower than the pre-pandemic rate. The limited new supply and robust demand have given landlords significant leverage in the market, leading to an increase in asking rents. On average, nationally, asking rents stood at $23.47 psf in the second quarter, representing a 4.7% year-over-year increase from the previous year.Moreover, despite cooling rent growth, apartment demand is showing signs of a solid rebound, with net absorption in the second quarter of 2023 nearing surging new supply levels. This stabilizes occupancy rates after a steep decline in 2022. Per RealPage data, in the second quarter, net demand registered at 83,449 units, and this marked a five-quarter high. While this is still below the record numbers seen during the 2021 boom, it indicates a normalization of apartment demand. This demand rebound coincides with a 50-year high in apartment construction starting to convert into peak completions, with more than 107,000 units completed in the second quarter of this year itself.However, despite the supply surge, this solid demand is aiding in the mitigation of vacancy spikes in most markets, with U.S. apartment occupancy coming at 94.7% as of June, marking only a 0.1 percentage point decline since January. It marks a notable improvement compared to the occupancy fall of 1.2 percentage points in the first half of 2022 and then an additional 1.4 percentage points in the second half of the year. However, rent growth remains below normal in 2023, with year-over-year effective asking rent growth at just 1.5%. This is due to apartment operators prioritizing occupancy rates over rents, leading to more options for renters and putting downward pressure on rent growth.The Zacks MethodologyPicking the right stock could be difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

It is reasonable to expect that losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt will occur in future periods, but the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our health care facilities and complicate period comparisons of our results of operations and operations comparisons with other health care companies.Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. as a measure of operating performance or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Because net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies.HCA Healthcare, Inc.Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures2023 Operating Results Forecast(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)For the Year EndingDecember 31, 2023LowHighRevenues$63,250$64,750Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc.

140,149753aa-12c6-3727-b05f-9188fc2d2c01,PPG,2023-07-27,Seeking Stability? 3 Top-Ranked Large-Caps to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeking-stability-3-top-ranked-203100950.html,1690403460,STORY,"['CAT', 'PPG', 'JPM']","[Large-cap stocks are found in almost every portfolio. They are well-established, have more analyst coverage, and frequently pay dividends, all undeniably significant benefits that make them so popular among investors.Of course, their steady nature may not appeal to all, with some preferring small-caps’ explosive growth characteristics. However, the decreased volatility large-caps possess is well worth the trade-off in the eyes of more conservative investors. For those seeking large-cap exposure, three stocks – Caterpillar CAT, PPG Industries PPG, and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM – have all seen their near-term outlooks shift positively. Let’s take a closer look at a few characteristics of each.Caterpillar Caterpillar, the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The revisions trend has been particularly noteworthy for its current fiscal year, with the $17.87 per share estimate up 25% since July of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares aren’t stretched regarding valuation, with the current 14.7X forward earnings multiple sitting beneath the 15.9X five-year median and highs of 21.4X in 2022. It’s worth noting that the company is forecasted to enjoy 30% earnings growth on 10% higher revenues in its current year, making the current valuation much more attractive.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, Caterpillar is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats club, showing a notable commitment to shareholders through at least 25+ years of increased payouts. CAT shares currently yield 2% annually paired with a sustainable 30% payout ratio.PPG IndustriesPPG’s earnings outlook has shifted nicely higher across all timeframes, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Revisions keep climbing higher, as we can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesLike CAT, PPG Industries has historically shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, recently joining the elite Dividend King club. Shares currently yield a solid 1.7% annually, with the payout growing by nearly 7% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile the company’s next quarterly release is scheduled for October 18th, it’s worth noting that analysts have become notably bullish for the release already, with the $1.94 per share estimate up nearly 5% since the beginning of July.JPMorgan Financial titan JPMorgan helped kick off earnings season positively, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 20% and delivering a sizable 11% revenue beat. Earnings saw growth of 58% year-over-year, whereas revenue grew 35%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to little surprise, analysts have been bullish across the board for the financial titan. The stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd like those above, JPM rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend that currently yields 2.6%. Dividend growth is there, too, with the payout growing by 8% just over the last five years.Bottom LineLarge caps are a common staple in every portfolio, as their stable nature paired with a successful track record is impossible to ignore.And for those seeking large-caps with a history of successful business operations, all three above – Caterpillar CAT, PPG Industries PPG, and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM – have seen their earnings outlooks shift positively.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Now, let me introduce PPG President and CEO, Tim Knavish.Tim Knavish: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I would like to start by providing a few highlights on our second quarter record financial performance and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered all-time record financial results in the second quarter, including sales of $4.9 billion, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.25 and year-to-date cash generation of about $620 million. Our adjusted EPS is about 24% higher than the second quarter of 2022 and cash generation of $750 million higher year-over-year. These strong financial results were achieved despite operating in an environment of variable global economic demand.Industrial production was muted, reflecting cautious consumer buying behavior in Europe and slower-than-expected recovery in China and softening demand in certain end use markets in the US. Overall, our results were supported by good growth trends in several of our technology, advantaged businesses and leading brands. PPG's strong positioning in these end use markets led to record second quarter sales in five of our nine businesses. Aerospace, automotive, automotive refinish, PPG Comex and our protective and marine coatings business. We implemented incremental price increases in the first half of the year, primarily in the Performance Coatings segment and our aggregate two-year stack pricing for the company is now about 20%, which is offsetting historically high cost inflation.We expect selling prices to remain positive in the second half 2023, recognizing prior year price increases will reach anniversaries as the year progresses. As I said at my CEO investor briefing in May, margin recovery is the top near-term priority. And we have made great progress this year in improving our segment margins toward our historical profile. Our aggregate segment margins in Q2 were about 16%, which is 330 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022. This included the Performance Coatings segment delivering margins of near 18%, the highest since 2016. Another key priority for our team has been to return to our legacy of strong cash generation. And through the first half of the year, we delivered record operating cash generation of about $620 million.This was supported by our record net earnings, but we also lowered our inventory levels by about $100 million on a sequential quarterly basis. Despite this reduction, our raw material inventories remain elevated and we are executing various actions, plans to further reduce these inventory levels over the next several quarters as commodity supply availability has improved significantly this year. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on three key drivers that are contributing to our excellent financial results in 2023. First, while overall global industrial production is challenging, including in a number of industrial end use markets that are already in recessionary type demand conditions, our portfolio of business mix is providing great resilience.Spray, Paintjakob-rosen-jq0RCl1nl9I-unsplashTwo of the best performing global industries in the second quarter were aerospace and auto OEM. We have established leading global positions in each of these end markets by facilitating our customer success through innovative and sustainably advantaged products and much relied upon services. We expect demand for our aerospace and auto OEM coatings products to remain robust as they are both still below 2019 demand levels. Two data points are, international flights remain 10% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels and over the past several years, lower automotive OEM global builds have resulted in an estimated supply deficit of about 40 million cars versus historical build rates. The second key driver is that we continue to deliver strong earnings performance in Europe as we achieved consecutive quarterly earnings records despite lackluster regional industrial production activity and weak aggregate -- architectural demand.This has been accomplished by our team's strong execution of cost and margin management. When this region begins to recover to any degree, PPG will be well positioned for solid topline and additional bottom line growth. The third key drivers are strong positioning in Mexico where current economic conditions remain robust including expansive nearshoring related growth, solid consumer wealth growth and an appreciating local currency. We expect the nearshoring benefits to continue for a number of years, first with capital investment and then through increased regional employment. PPG remains the clear leader in Mexico for architectural and automotive OEM and we have actions underway to capture further growth in our other businesses where we will leverage our core strengths, including the best-in-class PPG Comex concessionaire distribution network.I'd also like to comment on our enterprise growth strategy. A key pillar of this strategy is to partner with our customers to deliver superior service and products with a focus on enhancing their productivity and sustainability. In the second quarter, we continued to make advancements and earned several new customer wins. I'm excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us to win more customer value driven business and grow our organic sales. Now some quick updates about our important ESG initiatives. As we communicated in our 2022 ESG report, we've introduced 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that have now been validated according to climate science through the science-based targets initiative. We plan to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% within the same timeframe.Moving to our outlook. We expect global industrial production to remain at lower levels in the third quarter, including similar demand activity in Europe, some further slowing in the US and modest sequential improvement in China. We do expect certain pockets of industry activity to remain more resilient, including aerospace and automotive industries, where we are well positioned on a global basis. In addition, we expect economic activity in Mexico to remain solid. In our architectural businesses, we expect demand conditions to be mixed by geography. In Europe, we anticipate demand will stabilize at current levels, resulting in year-over-year sales volume being much closer to the prior year. In the US, we anticipate DIY demand to remain at lower levels and pro-contractor residential repaint activity to begin to modestly decline sequentially with the backdrop of lower existing home sales.Finally, in Mexico, we expect our PPG Comex business to continue to post solid organic growth. In the third quarter, we expect to realize additional benefits from moderating cost inputs. At the peak of our supply disruptions, we had more than 160 force majeures in our global supply chain. That is now about 10, which is in line with our historical norms. To date, we have not yet recognized the full financial benefit of our commodity supply chain normalizing. From a financial realization perspective, through the end of June, our input costs were still 20% higher than the pre-pandemic levels. As we further reduce our inventories, we will realize additional earnings benefit. We continue to work on our previously announced restructuring initiatives and expect an incremental $15 million year-over-year earnings benefit in the third quarter.Additionally, we will benefit from the recent paint film acquisition that we made in the second quarter. This business is uniquely positioned in the premium end of this new emerging market and has good customer pull and future growth prospects. Annual sales of this business are about $100 million. Despite the challenging environment, we have raised our full year earnings guidance and expect third quarter aggregated segment margins will be higher on a year-over-year basis for the fourth consecutive quarter. Finally, I want to thank our team members around the world who support our customers, serve our communities and continually look for ways to do better today than yesterday every day. It is their dedication and commitment to helping make our customers successful that gives me continued confidence in our future.As we mark PPG's 140th anniversary in August, I firmly believe that our best days still remain ahead of us.

The two plan to combine with $400 million in financing from private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Centerbridge.The announcement was a fresh reminder that the turmoil that started in the spring is still not over for the banking industry, which still faces questions about its strength as lenders struggle with high interest rates, rising funding costs, and declining profitability.PacWest stock declined 27% Tuesday and then soared 27% Wednesday.The deal is ""a reminder that the stresses on the banking system aren’t all just bad management at one firm,"" MacroPolicy Perspectives founder Julia Coronado told Yahoo Finance Wednesday. ""It is the inverted yield curve, it’s a generational shock in interest rates that banks are having to grapple with ... and that’s a reality that makes it hard for banks to make money.""The fresh volatility may come in handy for regulators as the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency try to sell a complex overhaul of new capital standards for banks on Thursday.They argue the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic triggered deposit withdrawals across the banking world. PacWest, caught up in that panic, sold assets to bolster its liquidity and capital strength.The new capital proposals are expected to face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.Story continuesRead more: How to get a personal loan with bad creditFederal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, Michael Barr. (Andrew Harnik/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said earlier this month that the Fed would principally raise capital requirements for the largest, most complex banks. The biggest institutions will be asked to hold an additional 2 percentage points of capital — or an additional $2 of capital for every $100 of risk-weighted assets. Capital is the buffer banks have to hold to absorb future losses.He also said regulators would widen the scope of the new rules to institutions with as few as $100 billion in assets, meaning roughly 30 banks would be subject to them. The combined PacWest and Banc of California would be under that cap, based on their combined assets of $36 billion.'Risk weights'These changes are part of the US version of an international accord known as Basel III that was developed following the 2008 crisis by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.The goal of that committee — which was convened by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland — was to set global regulatory capital standards so that banks would have enough in reserve to survive crises. The last version of this accord was agreed to in 2017, but plans to roll it out in the US were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.A key component of the revised rules will be a series of so-called ""risk weights"" applied to various assets banks hold. The riskier the assets are, the more capital banks will be required to set aside to absorb any future losses. Those assets can range from Treasuries and mortgages to derivatives and cryptocurrencies.Read more: CDs vs. bonds: Which is right for me?Barr has said that most banks already have enough capital to meet the new standards and estimated that banks would be able to build the required capital through retained earnings in less than two years — even while maintaining their dividends.""These changes would increase capital requirements overall, but I want to emphasize that they would principally raise capital requirements for the largest, most complex banks,"" he said in a speech earlier this month at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.He also made it clear that banks would have time to weigh in with any comments before the proposal is final. ""We intend to consider comments carefully and any changes would be implemented with an appropriate phase-in,"" he said, adding that most banks already have enough capital to meet the new requirements.Betsy Graseck, an equity analyst for Morgan Stanley, said she anticipates the ""phase-in"" for the largest banks to take three to five years.""A later phase in would be a positive for the group as it enables additional capital accretion through earnings generation,"" Graseck wrote in a Tuesday research note. ""An earlier, or shorter, phase in would be a negative.""By Graseck’s calculations, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) can cover the increased capital requirements from earnings in less than two years’ time. It would take Goldman Sachs (GS) three years and Citigroup (C) four years, she said.'Dancing in the streets'Banks are expected to push back.""Further capital requirements on the largest US banks will lead to higher borrowing costs and fewer loans for consumers and businesses — slowing our economy and impacting those on the margin hardest,"" Kevin Fromer, chief executive of bank lobbying group the Financial Services Forum, said on July 10.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts on July 14 that nonbank lenders are already celebrating their competitive advantage.""This is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone,"" Dimon said, naming two of the largest private equity players. ""They're dancing in the streets."" (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)Many midsize banks that could be part of these new rules are already making adjustments by holding back on any increases in dividends or share buybacks. Several also are selling assets to reduce the risks on their balance sheets or examining a pullback in certain types of lending.Citizens Bank (CFG) has said it will stop originating auto loans. Comerica (CMA) has said it expects to exit the majority of its warehouse lending business by the end of this year.""In a perfect world, everything that a bank is doing is profitable,"" said Scott Siefers, analyst with Piper Sandler. ""But if there’s now going to be a higher return requirement, meaning higher capital level, for a given asset, you might need to look more closely at your return.""JPMorgan, the nation’s biggest bank, told analysts it might have to raise prices on certain loans.""To the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks,"" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum said on July 14.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Unfortunately, even the giants aren’t immune to worrying market risks. And as we learned in physics class, the gravitational pull of the Earth is the same for all objects, irrespective of their mass.Extending the above analogy, while the acceleration may be the same, the impulsive forces exerted upon impact with the ground will of course vary between solid objects of different masses. In the market, blue chips rarely fail. But when they do, they take down millions of investors and may cause seismic ripple effects. That’s why it’s important to keep note of blue-chip stocks to avoid.Before the hate mail pours in, blue chip investing generally represents the smart conservative approach. However, even conservative ideas can trip up. Therefore, you should be wary of these blue-chip stocks printing troubling stats.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvitation Homes (INVH)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonAt the very real risk of starting this list of blue-chip stocks to sell as a complete clown show, I nevertheless have reservations about Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH). A powerhouse within the realm of single-family rental homes, Invitation has performed quite well this year. Since the Jan. opener, INVH gained nearly 21% of equity value. And while it’s down 1% in the trailing 365 days, it’s been moving upward at a steady clip.Still, I’m getting the wrong kind of tingling feeling in my gut when I look at the company’s first quarter of 2023 earnings report. Sure, the headline revenue print gained nearly 11% to $590 million. However, the average occupancy in Q1 came in at 97.8% compared to 98.2% in the year-ago quarter. As well, bad debt increased to 2% from 1.7%. Finally, new leases were 5.7%, down conspicuously from the 14.5% posted in Q1 2022.Story continuesFundamentally, it seems that broader economic pressures are weighing on consumers. In fairness, we’ll find out more when Invitation releases Q2 results next week. For now, I’m going to say it’s one of the blue-chip stocks to avoid.Global Payments (GPN)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinA multinational financial technology (fintech) enterprise, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides payment technology and services to merchants, issuers and consumers. Per its public profile, the company was named to the Fortune 500. Primarily, the company processes payments made through credit/debit cards and digital and contactless payments. Since the start of the year, GPN gained nearly 13% of equity value.Thanks to its combination of decent market performance and broader relevancies, GPN hardly seems like one of the blue-chip stocks to sell. While I again risk becoming a clown act here, investment data aggregator Gurufocus warns that Global suffers from three red flags: continued issuance of long-term debt, asset growth moving faster than revenue growth and an Altman Z-Score indicating business distress.Fundamentally, if the Federal Reserve decides to raise rates to truly get serious about inflation, consumer sentiment will likely fade. Also, mass layoffs may materialize, which would be bad news for consumer-spending-dependent blue chips. With households grappling with over $17 trillion in debt, the backdrop for GPN is messier than some investors realize.Philips (PHG)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockPerhaps the most recognizable name on this list of blue-chip stocks to avoid, Philips (NYSE:PHG) is a Dutch multinational conglomerate. Formerly one of the largest electronics firms in the world, Philips now concentrates on myriad personal care and consumer products. Thanks in large part to its wide relevance, PHG gained over 53% of equity value since the Jan. opener. So, this is one to sell?From a narrow context, PHG seems a no-brainer buy. However, in the trailing five years, shares slipped 43%. That’s a no-no in blue chip investing. Plus, I’m not really digging that PHG fell almost straight through the $30 long-term horizontal support line. It’s got to get up there and build a positive baseline for risk-intolerant investors to be interested.And it’s not just the clown in me speaking: Gurufocus warns that PHG rates as a possible value trap. Sure, it’s trading at a forward earnings multiple of 17.51, which seems incredibly cheap. However, operating losses expanded unfavorably to $625 million in Q1 2023. This contrasts with an operating loss of $200 million in the year-ago quarter. Given possible consumer headwinds ahead, I’d be tempted to sell into strength.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But worldwide sales of Barbie to retailers excluding adjustments fell 6% in the quarter ended June 30 as promotions were shifted to align with last weekend's release of the iconic doll's first live action picture. Mattel executives told analysts during an earnings call following the release that sales have improved in July, and it expects the movie will have a halo effect on the brand for years to come.The film — which set an opening weekend record last week for the year — splashed worldwide attention on the doll and boosted shares of the company in the past month. Ahead of the opening, Mattel created a product marketing blitz with more than 100 brands plastering pink everywhere. But it won't likely see the full benefits of the tie-ins for awhile — and consumers are still spending cautiously on toys.“We significantly increased free cash flow and continued to gain market share,"" said Ynon Kreiz, chairman and CEO of Mattel in a statement. “Importantly, this moment will be remembered as a key milestone in our company’s history with the release of the Barbie movie.”The movie release comes also at a time when Kreiz, who came to Mattel’s helm in 2018, is turning the toy company into an intellectual property house, with “Barbie” the first of 14 live action movies planned with major studios.The company made $27.2 million, or 8 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30. That compares with net income of $66.4 million, or 18 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Sales fell 12% to $1.09 billion from $1.23 billion in the year-ago quarter as retailers trimmed orders for toys amid economic uncertainty.Analysts were expecting a loss of 3 cents-a-share on sales of $1 billion.Story continuesAnthony DiSilvestro, chief financial officer of Mattel, noted that the “retail inventory correction” is behind it.Net sales and gross billings in the North America segment decreased 18% during the second quarter. Gross billings is a metric that reflects sales to retailers before adjustments.For the second quarter, worldwide gross billings for the doll category was $441 million, up 10% as reported, or 9% in constant currency, versus the prior year, primarily driven by Disney Princess and Disney Frozen, and Monster High, partially offset by a decline in Barbie.Mattel reiterated its financial outlook despite a surprise profit in the quarter.Mattel stuck to its full-year outlook, which it projects to be flat from last year, and adjusted profit per share between $1.10 and $1.20 per share.Shares slipped 2% in after market trading on Wednesday after adding 15 cents to $21.32 per share.“While the Barbie blockbuster didn’t happen in Mattel’s Q2, its takeover of pop culture shows the huge potential its IP has, “ said Insider Intelligence Principal Analyst Jeremy Goldman in a statement. ”It also speaks to Mattel’s ability to work with key Hollywood players to bring its properties to life in a media-savvy manner.

This compares to earnings of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 350%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this toy maker would post a loss of $0.26 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.24, delivering a surprise of 7.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Mattel , which belongs to the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, posted revenues of $1.09 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.18%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mattel shares have added about 18.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19%.What's Next for Mattel?While Mattel has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mattel: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

You've got Meta, Chipotle, Mattel, and eBay.Kicking it off with Meta, the sole gainer here in extended trading, shares up just about 4 and 1/2%. Pretty strong results here from the company. Its most recent quarter of double digit revenue growth. They posted this for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2020. One third quarter revenue forecast also coming in better than expected. Daily active users topping the Street's expectations. Monthly active users, over 3 billion over the last three monthsLooking at gains of just about 42% year to date. Gains of 148%. Of course, Meta has been one of the big beneficiaries of this AI fueled rally that we've seen since the start of the year. We'll see whether or not that momentum carries on from here on out.Let's take a look at Chipotle. That stock off over 9% right now. The company shares sliding after its sales fell short. Higher prices on tortillas, on dairy, beef, pressuring some of the company's profits here in its most recent quarter. Also their comp sales, that fell below Wall Street's expectations. Big reason why we're seeing the stock in the red here in extended trading over the last three months. We're only looking at gains of just about 4%.Let's move on to Mattel. That stock off about 1% right now. Sales down 12% from a year ago. Adjusted EPS down 44% from a year ago. The ""Barbie"" movie, that of course, has been all the hype. Everything that we've been talking about when it comes to Mattel over the last several months. Those results not reflected in these quarter's results.But Mattel hoping that some of that hype is going to boost sales for their very, very important holiday period here in the second half of the year. Over the last three months, we're looking at gains of 25%. We've already seen some of that hype in just the last month alone, with Mattel shares rising about 17% ahead of the ""Barbie"" movie release last week.All right, let's also take-- round it out with eBay. That stock off about 4.5%, consumer story here playing out. We're seeing that reflected in the stock price here. Profit outlook disappointing. They're clearly had been losing some market share to some of their competitors out there.We've seen a bit of a strategic shift here from management trying to focus on maybe some of the higher priced items, hoping that that is going to improve sales from here on out. One highlight, though, in this report, ad revenue did come in better than expected, at 367 million over the last month. Gains of about 12%]"
154,67614e1f-9d3b-3a3b-8cf4-d6df35a957b6,SLB,2023-07-27,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Schlumberger Limited (SLB) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-schlumberger-limited-130007885.html,1690376407,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +20.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which Schlumberger falls in, has gained 23.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of +22.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.99 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +37.2%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.69 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $8.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.2%. The $32.95 billion and $36.67 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.3% and +11.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.6%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.65%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

158,d61085ea-ca13-3836-b2a7-2aafafb54f2e,AIG,2023-07-27,Goosehead Insurance (GSHD) Q2 Earnings and Revenues Top Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goosehead-insurance-gshd-q2-earnings-211506359.html,1690406106,STORY,"['GSHD', 'AIG']","[Goosehead Insurance (GSHD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 36.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurance company would post earnings of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.17, delivering a surprise of 325%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Goosehead , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, posted revenues of $69.28 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.84%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $53.02 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Goosehead shares have added about 93.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19%.What's Next for Goosehead?While Goosehead has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Goosehead: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.29 on $70.85 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.07 on $267.89 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

159,11c68fd1-c2fe-3ba9-a3f9-962eb1573b1e,AIG,2023-07-27,What's in the Cards for American International's (AIG) Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-american-internationals-aig-175200515.html,1690393920,STORY,"['AIG', 'AFL']","[American International Group, Inc. AIG is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, after the market close.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American International’s second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.54, which indicates an improvement of 29.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $12,284 million, suggesting 12.7% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Earnings Surprise HistoryAmerican International’s bottom line beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 9.22%. This is depicted in the chart below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteIn the second quarter, revenues of AIG are likely to have benefited on the back of strong contributions from higher premium income and net investment income. While premiums are likely to have received a boost on the back of solid commercial and personal lines businesses, net investment income is expected to have gained from improved returns from fixed maturities and loans.We expect premium income of American International to be $7,869.1 million, which implies a 4.8% rise year over year. Our estimate for net investment income stands at $2,627.8 million, suggesting 0.9% growth year over year.Strong contributions from the General Insurance and, Life and Retirement segments are expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The General Insurance unit is likely to have been aided by strength in commercial business resulting from rate increases, higher retention rates and new business growth. We anticipate net premiums written of the General Insurance segment to be $7,286.6 million, suggesting 6.1% growth year over year. Growing earned premiums and an improved combined ratio are expected to have boosted the underwriting results of the unit in the second quarter. Our estimate for its underwriting income indicates a surge of 38.9% year over year. Meanwhile, we project the General Insurance’s adjusted pretax income to be $1,561.8 million, implying 24.3% growth year over year.Story continuesThe Life and Retirement business of AIG is likely to have received an impetus from growing premiums and deposits in the to-be-reported quarter, which in turn, are expected to have stemmed from increased fixed annuity and fixed index annuity product sales. Our estimate for adjusted revenues in the segment is pegged at $4,566.5 million, suggesting 13.1% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.However, reduced alternative investment income and lower fee income are expected to have been a roadblock for the Life and Retirement unit in the second quarter. We expect adjusted pretax income of the segment to be $626.2 million, which indicates a decline of 16.2% year over year.Despite numerous cost-cutting initiatives and favorable mortality experience, the bottom line of American International is likely to have suffered a blow due to an elevated expense base related to policyholder benefits and losses incurred plus general operating and other expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for total benefits and expenses stands at $11,220.5 million, implying a 15.2% increase year over year.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American International this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here, as you see below.Earnings ESP: American International has an Earnings ESP of -0.56% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.53 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AIG currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for American International, here are some companies from the insurance space, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company AEL has an Earnings ESP of +7.85% and a Zacks Rank of 2, currently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEL’s second-quarter 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, indicating a surge of 60.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.American Equity’s bottom line beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 13.01%.Aflac Incorporated AFL has an Earnings ESP of +1.41% and a Zacks Rank of 3, currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFL’s second-quarter 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.42 per share. The consensus mark for AFL’s second-quarter earnings has moved 0.7% north in the past 60 days.Aflac’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.23%.Brighthouse Financial, Inc. BHF has an Earnings ESP of +0.42% and a Zacks Rank of 3, currently.

160,839f6273-2f35-3ae8-9938-292ca2f57db1,AIG,2023-07-27,Lemonade (LMND) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lemonade-lmnd-expected-beat-earnings-140227361.html,1690380147,STORY,"['LMND', 'AIG']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Lemonade (LMND) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.3%.Revenues are expected to be $97.64 million, up 95.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lemonade?For Lemonade, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.10%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Lemonade will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lemonade would post a loss of $1.14 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.95, delivering a surprise of +16.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Lemonade appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, American International Group (AIG), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +29.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $12.28 billion, up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for American International Group has been revised 1.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.56%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American International Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Powell said that the FOMC will be particularly focused on the inflation data, and we expect the next few CPI reports to be soft,"" said David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, in a note.Story continuesOn tap on the economic front, the Commerce Department is set to report that the U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.8% annualized rate last quarter, in its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP growth.At 7:01 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 48 points, or 0.13%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 26 points, or 0.57%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 186 points, or 1.19%.Netflix climbed 0.8% after a report that it was restructuring its advertising partnership with Microsoft for its lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan and also cutting ad prices.EBay forecast third-quarter profit below market expectations as the e-commerce platform spent more to bolster categories such as auto parts, refurbished goods and collectibles, sending its shares down 5.3%.Chipmakers including Nvidia, Micron and Marvell Technology rose between 2% and 4% after Lam Research forecast upbeat quarterly sales. Shares of Lam rose 3.3%.Universal banks including Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America crept higher between 0.2% and 0.6%, ahead of a rule that U.S. regulators are set to unveil later in the day that could significantly raise capital requirements for the lenders.Southwest Airlines tumbled 6.9% after the airline warned of higher labor costs for the year and posted a dip in second-quarter profit.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.7%.Revenues are expected to be $32.13 billion, down 34.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Phillips 66?For Phillips 66, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Phillips 66 will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Phillips 66 would post earnings of $3.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.21, delivering a surprise of +17.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Phillips 66 doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsEnLink Midstream (ENLC), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.11 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -35.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.91 billion, down 26.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for EnLink Midstream has been revised 5.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 11.63%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that EnLink Midstream will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Phillips 66 The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Phillips 66The insider Gregory Hayes made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$97.75 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$108. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the Phillips 66 insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. Gregory Hayes was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Phillips 66Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Phillips 66 insiders own about US$106m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Phillips 66 Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Phillips 66 insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ameren would post earnings of $0.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +6.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ameren appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPSEG (PEG), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.62 for the quarter ended June 2023.

The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by increased interest rates and rising operating costs. Further, cost management, customer growth, systematic investment to strengthen infrastructure to increase the resilience of the system and new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.With the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four utilities, namely Exelon Corporation EXC, Consolidated Edison ED, Public Service Enterprise Group PEG and Atmos Energy ATO, which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations.

New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand, and assisting the utilities. Investments in strengthening the infrastructure are allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations. The performances of the utilities are likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities continue to invest smart capital that assists in cutting operating and maintenance expenses, and fuel costs, in turn, keeping the utility bills affordable for customers.Utilities have been adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Howard Alan RubelThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.Story continuesPhebe N. NovakovicThank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our long-time board member and Lead Director, Jim Crown. Jim has a record of distinguished service on the GD board for over 35 years. Throughout that time, Jim provided guidance to more than 5 different management teams. We mourn his passing, and our prayers are with his family. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on revenue of $10.2 billion, operating earnings of $962 million and net income of $744 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our 4 business segments. Importantly, we had a 12% revenue increase across the Defense segment, with a more modest 4.6% increase at Aerospace. While revenue is up by $963 million or 10.5%, operating earnings are down $16 million and net earnings are down $22 million against last year's second quarter. So we had significant revenue increase but lower operating margin against the year-ago quarter.From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.14 per share on significantly higher revenue and modestly lower operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. The earnings beat was exclusively operations-driven. We enjoyed very nice sequential improvement. Revenue was up $271 million, and operating earnings are up $24 million on identical operating margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $20 billion is up $1.45 billion, or 7.8% over last year's first half. operating earnings of $1.9 billion are up less than 1% and net earnings are down $22 million, largely as a result of below-the-line items, including a higher provision for income taxes.As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after capital expenditures in the quarter continued at a very good pace. For the first half, free cash flow was 123% in net income. Obviously, we are off to a very good start from a cash perspective.As is clear from the press release, we also had a powerful order quarter across the business, extending our already large backlog. Jason will provide full color around that item as well. In summary, this is from a revenue perspective, a very strong quarter and a good first half. Supply chain issues and past COVID labor issues have impacted operating margins, but there is relief in sight. We expect improvement as we progress. At this point, let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter.Jason W. AikenThank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 for the company. Order activity was strong across the board, as each segment had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater in the quarter. This is quite impressive in light of the strong revenue growth. Combat Systems and Aerospace did particularly well with book-to-bill of 1.4x and 1.3x, respectively. This led to record-level backlog of $91.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up 1.7% from last quarter and up 4.3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $129 billion.Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $731 million of operating cash flow, which, following our strong first quarter performance, brings us to $2.2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $519 million for the quarter and over $1.8 billion year-to-date, yielding a cash conversion rate of 123% for the first half. This conversion rate reflects continued strong cash performance in Aerospace &amp; Technologies and a particularly strong start to the year for the Combat Systems group from payments received on our large international vehicle programs. The year-to-date results are consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $212 million, or 2.1% of sales in the quarter, which brings us to 1.9% of sales for the first 6 months. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be higher in the second half of the year, but in line with our expectation to be just under 2.5% of sales for the year.Also in the quarter, we paid $360 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of stock for $288 million. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 1.8 million shares for $378 million. We also repaid $750 million of debt that matured in May and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down nearly $700 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million maturing in the third quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million compared to $95 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $180 million, down from $193 million for the same period in 2022. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $360 million. Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 16.5%. There's no change to our outlook for the full year of approximately 17%. But of course, that implies a rate in the mid-17% range for the second half of the year. To shape that for you, we'd expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth due to typical timing items.Now turning to operating performance and technologies. It was another solid quarter with revenue of $3.2 billion, which is up 7% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong start to the year we saw in the first quarter. In fact, each business grew year-over-year, both in the quarter and the first half. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect. So we feel good about their prospects for the balance of the year. GDIT had another solid quarter. In fact, their highest second quarter revenues since before the pandemic as they continue to deliver on their steady year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings in the quarter were $283 million, yielding a margin of 8.8%. As you know, margins are driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume, and in this case, were further impacted by the mix of new start programs that are driving the strong growth trajectory.Backlog grew during the quarter, with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1 on solid order activity that outpaced the strong revenue growth across the business. In fact, GDIT booked the highest first-half orders they've seen since mid-2019, and their pipeline remains robust with $20 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $81 billion in qualified opportunities identified.Now let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments and give an update on our guidance for 2023.Phebe N. NovakovicThanks, Jason. Now let me continue to review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide color as appropriate and guidance for the full year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $236 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $86 million more than last year's second quarter on the strength of additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher Gulfstream service center volume, partially offset by less volume in Jet Aviation's completion center. The 24 deliveries are modestly fewer than planned and are a result of supply chain issues.On the good news side of the equation, supply chain conditions are improving. We still have a significant backlog of late parts, but processes are in place to catch up, deliveries are trending positive and we have greater transparency. In short, the suppliers are more predictable and are complying with catch-up schedules. This will help both revenue and margins as we do less out-of-station work.Operating earnings of $236 million are $2 million behind last year's second quarter as a result of a 60 basis point reduction in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was off largely as a result of the supply chain issues and higher R&amp;D expense. The shortage of parts continues to cause significant out-of-station work, impacting efficiency. As mentioned earlier, we see improvement here, and that should help as we go through the second half. Sequentially, Aerospace had a 3.2% increase in revenue and a 3.1% increase in operating earnings on identical operating margins.Moving to the demand environment. Aerospace had a very good quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in dollar terms and even higher for Gulfstream aircraft alone. Vibrant sales activity and strong pipeline replenishment were evident in the quarter. The U.S., particularly large corporations, led the way with the Mid East and Asia participating to a lesser degree.The 700 flight test and certification program continues to progress. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. However, we now target certification in the fourth quarter and see no major obstacles in our path. To give you a little more insight, we will complete our FAA-type inspection authorization in September. This is a fly we are required to do pursuant to FAA requirement and plan. When we are finished, the FAA will fly some confirmatory flight tests to verify portions of our results. That will be followed by a brief period of paper submission, followed by FAA review.As most of you know, we had planned to deliver considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. That has now flipped into the fourth quarter. We now expect to deliver 27 aircraft in the third quarter, with a rapid increase in the fourth quarter deliveries. In short, we are making good progress under difficult circumstances. However, we expect to deliver 5 to 6 fewer aircraft than the 145 we forecast at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we expect more service revenue than initially anticipated. I'll have more on this later in my remarks.Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.92 billion, up a stunning 15.5% over the year ago quarter with growth in each of the business units. Earnings of $251 million are up 2.4%. Margins at 13% represent a 170 basis point reduction over the year-ago quarter. So we saw powerful revenue performance, coupled with more modest operating margin in large part attributable to mix. The increase in revenue came from international vehicle programs at both Land Systems and European Land Systems. OTS has also enjoyed higher artillery program volume, including programs to expand production capacity for the U.S. government. These programs carry dilutive margins, but will result in more production and accretive margins over time. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $168 million or 9.6%, and earnings are up $6 million or 2.4% on a 100 basis point reduction in margin for the reasons described. Year-to-date, revenue is up $339 million or 10.1%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 5.1%. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a 1.4:1 book-to-bill, evidencing strong demand for munitions and domestic combat vehicles. International programs also contributed to the strong book-to-bill. So a very exciting first half for Combat.Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.1 billion is up $408 million, a robust 15.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, and to a lesser degree, TAO growth. Operating earnings are $235 million, up $24 million over the year-ago quarter, with a 30 basis point decrement in operating margin. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations.On a sequential basis, revenue was up $67 million or 2.2%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 11.4% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. For the first half, revenue was up $749 million or 14.1% and earnings are up $24 million or 5.7%. So a good quarter and first half.So let me move on to give you our updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to all of this, which will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, revenue will be down almost $200 million due to the 5 or 6 fewer aircraft deliveries, offset in part by stronger service activity. So look for revenue of $10.2 billion. We also expect margins to be down from a projected 14.6% to 14.1%. This implies operating earnings of $1.4 billion.With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems will have revenue of $400 million to $500 million higher than previously projected due to new program starts and an increased threat environment. So look for the total revenue of around $7.75 billion. Margins will be down 50 basis points from 14.7% to 14.2% on mix. All-in, operating earnings will be up $25 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $900 million or $1 billion on acceleration of work throughout the yards. This is a leading indicator of improving efficiency. So we will have annual revenue around $11.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.6% for the reasons I have previously described to you. Operating earnings for the year should be up $20 million over the previous forecast. Technologies revenue will be $100 million to $200 million better than previous guidance, but operating margin will be 9.4%, 10 basis points lower than previously forecast. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of about $12.7 billion, with operating earnings around $1.2 billion, steady with prior guidance. There is some opportunity here to capture 10 to 20 basis points of margin. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue higher than our initial guidance and an overall operating margin about 40 basis points lower. So look for total revenue to be around $42.45 billion, about $1.2 billion up from previous guidance. Operating earnings should be down modestly from prior guidance, but below-the-line items and lower share count will leave our EPS guidance the same.One final note before I conclude my comments. Howard has informed the company that he intends to retire later this year. So this will be his last earnings call. We are grateful for the excellent work that Howard has done since joining our team. I hope many of you will join me in congratulating Howard on a job well done. Nicole Shelton, who some of you know already, will be taking over the mantle with the third-quarter call. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions.Howard Alan RubelThank you for your kind words and friendship. It's been a pleasure and a great experience to have had the opportunity to represent General Dynamics to the investment community these nearly 6 years. I have grown working side by side with many of the talented people of this tremendous enterprise. I look forward to working with Nicole over the next few months to ensure there are proper introductions and a seamless transition. There will be time ahead to say goodbye, but today, I want to say thank you. Now let's turn to the question-and-answer period of this call. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask 1 question and 1 follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question press star, then the #1 on your telephone keypad. And again, we ask that you please limit Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanThanks very much. Congratulations, Howard. Thanks for everything. Just on the new Aerospace guidance, I guess, maybe if you could walk through how you thought about the setup for that. And I appreciate that this is mainly a timing issue and that any airplanes that don't get delivered in '23 can kind of move to '24. But just kind of the way we get level set. With 27 deliveries in the third quarter, we're talking about something quite high to get to 140-ish for the year. And also, I mean, with 27 deliveries, I assume we'll be looking at a margin in Q3 that's probably still in the 12s. And so also getting to 14.1% for the year. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the margin -- the initial margin accretion from the new aircraft and what that contribution will be to the total deliveries.Phebe N. NovakovicYes. So I think you've put your finger on [another] issue. So what we have given you with respect to Aerospace is Gulfstream's plan, and the guidance that we gave you reflects their plan. Our January guidance, just for context, contemplated a very high Q4 delivery rate. That rate increased with the certification delay on the 700. 700 will be fully built and ready for delivery.Remember, too, our new planes are all built in purpose-built facilities. We've expanded our wing line. In short, we facilitized for increased production. And finally, the fact that we have planes -- and you can see this from the increase in inventory that are awaiting parts -- we now have a schedule, and all of that taken together allows us to -- will give us the ability to deliver. With respect to margin, we've got a number of higher-margin airplanes, as you would expect, delivering in the fourth quarter. So that provides significant uplift. So we kind of explained how we intend to get the revenue through the deliveries, and the margin is really a question of mix of the higher deliveries -- of higher-margin -- greater deliveries to higher-margin airplanes.Seth Michael SeifmanOkay. And just a follow-up real quick on this topic. The 27 deliveries in Q3 would be down year-on-year. And so in terms of -- there's the issue of the G700 certification, which we're all kind of looking at and it's hard to analyze. But just for the non-G700 deliveries, is there any risk around what the plan was there and what Gulfstream expects to do?Phebe N. NovakovicSo as I noted in my remarks, our supply chain is increasing its transparency, improving its processes. And we have reliable -- increasingly reliable schedules. That said, they're more likely to anticipate more catch-up in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to complete a number of those airplanes, but they're still impacting the third quarter deliveries.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.Robert Alan StallardI can't believe Howard's retiring. He's so young.Phebe N. NovakovicThat's what we say.Robert Alan StallardAnyway, I've got a couple of questions for you, Phebe. First of all, on the revised Aerospace guidance. You mentioned that you've increased your expectations for services for the full year. I was wondering if you could square this with what we've been seeing in Biz Jet flight hours year-to-date, which have been down year-on-year. And then secondly, a great Combat Systems order quarter, but how do you expect these orders to flow through to revenue growth over the next couple of years?Phebe N. NovakovicSo our flying hours are not down. But I think, too, the way to think about our service business is we expect service to increase as the fleet of airplanes -- new airplanes in the market increases. We expect steady growth in service, and we haven't seen any impact so far on any change in flying hours. I said that mostly other people flying hours.With respect to Combat, the world has become a less safe place, and that's reflected in the increased demand, both internationally and in the United States. So we expect the -- this year to be considerably higher than last year. And we'll give you clarity around 2024 in January. But as you may recall, we had anticipated flat to down growth in this business segment. Clearly, that trajectory has changed. We won't be able to -- we can't quantify it right now, but we'll give you more clarity on that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.David Egon StraussThanks. So back on the G700, would you expect to make up the missed deliveries this year? Would you expect them to make those up next year? So does the -- I think, what was -- 170 go higher in terms of what you're expecting for deliveries next year?Phebe N. NovakovicWell, we'll get into next year, next year. But the deliveries are lower, are -- 5 to 6 deliveries that won't deliver this year are not 700s. So it's other airplanes.David Egon StraussOkay. Got it. And then as a follow-up, quick follow-up. Combat Systems, you mentioned this during the prepared remarks, the lower margins in the quarter, and then it looks like you're forecasting a bit of a snapback in the second half of the year. But still a fair amount lower than what you were initially forecasting. Can you just give a little bit more detail on the mix and how that's impacting? Thanks.Phebe N. NovakovicYes. So mix in this instance is comprised of 2 elements. One is the capacity expansion, which I noted carries lower margin. And then it's really the transition from more mature programs to newer programs, and those margins will improve as we come down our learning curves.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.Cai von RumohrTerrific. So -- and Howard, let me say, you've been terrific to work with and a great friend, and I wish you all the best. So Phebe, how many 700s are you assuming to deliver in the fourth quarter? And what kind of margin for error is there in terms of timing? In terms of...Phebe N. NovakovicWe will deliver 19 G700s, and we're not going to tell you margins will be accretive. Nice try. Why have we ever give you margins by your point?Cai von RumohrNo, I just -- so -- and next -- I didn't mean -- I meant how much time-wise, a cushion you have in the schedule if the certification slips.Phebe N. NovakovicYou mean the schedule for the 700 certification?Cai von RumohrYes. I mean, is your best guess that you certify in the middle of November, in middle of December, which could impact the amount number of planes you get out the door.Phebe N. NovakovicSo what we've told you is our best estimate right now of the certification process. Clearly, if it comes very late in the year, we'll deliver airplanes, but we won't necessarily be able to deliver all of them. That will bleed over into the best first quarter GD has ever had in its history. But we're not anticipating that at the moment. So I don't have real good clarity because we don't know yet with precision on when in the fourth quarter. But our best estimate, what we're planning for right now is that we will be able to have sufficient time to deliver these airplanes. Remember, they're built -- the pilot training will start, and that will help significantly with deliveries.Cai von RumohrGot it. And with all of these deliveries in the fourth quarter, maybe, Jason, can you give us some color in terms of the cash flow profile? I mean do we have just a momentous fourth quarter cash? And is there any upside to the 105%?Jason W. AikenThe way I think you need to think about that, Cai, is when it comes to Gulfstream, we have a sequence of progress payments that occurs from the time of the initial order through delivery and entry into service. So the vast majority of the cash receipts associated with an aircraft order and aircraft delivery are in-house before the actual airplane is delivered. So while there's obviously an implied set of progress payments, final delivery payments would occur at that point. When those aircraft enter into service, it's not an outsized level of cash, 1 way or the other. So the bigger issue is you've got an ongoing sequence and series of progress payments associated with all of the orders in the order book. And with the significant order volume that we've had over the past 2, 2.5 years, that is sort of a machine that's just churning those progress payments over time as we continue to make progress on each of those airplane builds as well as the certification process.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonAnd congratulations on retirement, Howard. In terms of the -- the outlook for Aerospace orders, could you just comment, Phebe, what you're seeing for the rest of the year? Obviously, the second quarter was probably helped a little bit because of the anomaly you mentioned in March around the banking crisis. And then also if you can comment on churn in the backlog, I think your net book-to-bill was a couple of hundred million lighter than your gross book-to-bill. So maybe just talk about any cancellations.Phebe N. NovakovicYes. So the demand in the second quarter was at the same level as the demand in the first quarter. It felt very, very similar. As you've quite rightly noted, we had a 3-week hiatus coincident with the banking crisis. But the demand levels have remained about the same. And as we enter Q3, we have a very strong pipeline. And so far, activity is quite good in Q3. We had 6 defaults in the quarter, but nothing that is notable to us. And the backlog is holding up very, very well.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup.Jason Michael GurskyCongrats, Howard. I look forward to getting some postcards from -- or in distant places.Phebe, just sticking with Gulfstream for 1 last question, hopefully here. On the pipeline and kind of what you see from a bottom-up perspective, can you give us a little flavor from a geographic perspective and customer type? How is high net worth doing versus corporate? And are we beginning to see some green shoots in geographies outside the United States?Phebe N. NovakovicYes. So the United States was strong, has been strong, particularly with the Fortune 500. I would say that high net worth is about the same. And the Mid East is pretty good, as is Asia, but it's really the Fortune 500 that are really driving the demand. These are long-established customers as well as new Fortune 500 customers.Jason Michael GurskyOkay. Great. And then Jason, over to you on Technologies. It sounds like you've got a robust pipeline of opportunities in front of you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix of that? We had some margin degradation here in the quarter. I'm just kind of curious, as you look out at that pipeline, do you see anything that would suggest we're going to see a departure in any -- either higher or lower from a margin perspective as you bid on this work and bring it in?Jason W. AikenI think bottom line, the short answer to that is no. We don't see any fundamental change, as we've talked about. You're going to see some level of aggregate margin perturbation between the 2 businesses, the IT services side being somewhat lower obviously, than the hardware side. I think in this quarter, we saw it a little more pronounced because as we're seeing this turn for the group to a stronger growth level, a lot of that is driven by not only new starts, but it's actually replacement contracts, or I should say, recompetes that we've won. So you had in the prior year the trailing off of very mature-level legacy contracts that were closing out at higher margin rates as compared to the entry-level margin rates we're seeing now. So that's sort of the driver of the year-over-year delta that you're seeing. But barring any major structural shift between the percentage contributions of the IT services versus defense hardware parts of the business, we continue to expect this to be a low double-digit margin business over time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Rob Epstein from Bank of America.Ronald Jay EpsteinAnd ditto Cai's remarks, Howard, you will be missed. It's been a pleasure working with you. So quickly, a couple of questions. On Technologies, what should we be looking for? I mean, sometimes the contracts there aren't as obvious in the horizon. So Jason, what should we be looking to file for in the second half of the year as potential things you guys could win?Jason W. AikenRon, it's always tough in this business to point to a singular example or a contract that is going to drive the overall business. As you know, it's a wide portfolio of literally thousands of contracts. I think -- the thing I would tell you is, when you look at Mission Systems on the 1 hand, they are really seeing strong support in their, what I'd call their Navy platform support businesses, whether it's the strategic side or the mission computing side. They're also seeing really great support in their cyber portfolio. So those are 2 areas I would expect to see continued growth in particular out of that business.When you look at GDIT, they're seeing strength in all 3 of their customer segments: the defense, the intelligence community and the Fed SIV side. So really good across-the-board support in GDIT. And I think if I could point to any 1 thing in particular on that side of the portfolio, we've talked for the past few weeks, a couple of months about some selective technology investments they've been making to accelerate their growth, and we're seeing that really start to take hold.And of course, we're talking about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, hybrid cloud, Zero Trust and so on. And that's really starting to bear fruit. We've seen already several hundred million dollars worth of award wins as well as organic growth on existing contracts that's resulting directly from those investments. They've got some $7 billion in change in post-submittal submissions that are awaiting award decisions. And they've got another 20-plus, I think, between $20 billion, $25 billion of opportunities in the pipeline that are directly tied to those targeted investments. So I think some really intelligent capital allocation over there at GDIT to try and drive that growth, and we'd expect to see the results of that continue in the second half of the year and beyond.Ronald Jay EpsteinOkay. Great. And then maybe 1 follow-on for Phebe. When we think about Aero, when things start to normalize, right, supply chain kind of gets back to a normal cadence and all that, what should we be thinking about broadly as like a realistic margin target?Phebe N. NovakovicWe're thinking in the higher teens when we get on a steady state with upside potential.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair.Michael Louie D DiPalmaAnd Howard, thank you for your deep aerospace defense expertise in your current position and your former position on the sell side. Your high standards raised the level of those around you.For Jason, for the Army's CHS-6 $8 billion recompete that should be announced, I think, very soon. GD Mission Solutions is teaming with GDIT. Do you feel these synergistic joint bids between IT and Mission will become more common and a significant strategic advantage for you? And could it help return the overall technology segment to mid-single-digit growth over the long term?Jason W. AikenYes. And bottom line answer, you kind of hit the nail on the head there. We absolutely expect the synergistic benefits of these 2 businesses working together to be to our benefit over the long run. It's -- the predicate for all that is that what we've seen both in the customer demand environment, what they're requiring in terms of end-to-end solutions, including both software, services and the hardware elements of what we provide. We're seeing the peer group migrate that way with some of their M&amp;A activities that you've seen in the market. And so, we believe that is the thesis that we'll see play out.You noted CHS-6, we're obviously participating in and anticipating that resolution to that competition. We've seen that program migrate over time from 1 that was traditionally very much focused on high-end, customized, ruggedized hardened-type defense hardware to 1 that is a combination of that type of capability as well as a more traditional, sort of off-the-shelf catalog-type product. And so we believe that having the attributes of both GDIT and Mission Systems involved in that program would be the best suited to serve our customer there. So that's just 1 good example of it. But absolutely, we see that over time. And as far as long-term growth rates, we'll have to see where this leads. Right now, we continue to track low- to mid-single digit, but we'll see if we can't get some juice out of that over time.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluHoward, exactly what Louie said, and then thank you for being such a great colleague and a teacher to me and all those around you, so thank you. Phebe or Jason, whoever. On the Defense business, when you look at your 2023 guidance, Defense growth is up solidly up 5% for the year versus the 9% growth you did in the first half. But this is not necessarily leading to operating leverage with margin contraction of 40 bps and flat operating profit. So how do you think about the return to operating margin expansion either on a total company level or a segment basis? It seems like Technologies is more temporary, Combat mix maybe continues for some time.Phebe N. NovakovicTechnologies and Combat are simply a question of mix. And I suspect Combat will quickly return to its normal operating leverage. The Marine Group has significant supply chain challenges that have impacted for the Virginia-class in particular. That's going to take some time to resolve. We'll talk about that in a little bit more detail. So as I noted, we expect slow quarter-over-quarter margin growth in the Marine Group. Perhaps an occasional perturbation by quarter, but slow and steady improvement over time.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets.Kenneth George HerbertCongratulations, Howard. Phebe, I just wanted to dig into Marine again a little deeper. The full year guide implies a pretty significant deceleration in growth into the back half of the year. Two questions, really. First, as we go back 6 months, you were talking about a much more conservative outlook for the top line in Marine. And clearly, maybe any comments on really what's changed because the first half has really been much stronger than expected. But then also, as you think about the remainder of the year, what will drive the significant step down and how much conservatism does the Marine outlook reflect in terms of the growth?Phebe N. NovakovicSo growth in the quarter was driven by improved -- increased volume on Columbia and on [the ELA] program as well as additional throughput throughout each 1 of those yards, which is often a precursor to better margin performance. And finally, just the -- revenue came in faster than we had anticipated, really across the board. And that will drive our expectations. With respect to the margin performance, we have -- Columbia is doing very well. We've got nice performance on the oiler. We see some deck plate improvements of Bath, but that has yet to translate into financial performance. Electric Boat needs to continue to get better to offset likely additional supply chain challenges as the Virginia supply chain begins to improve. And with respect to that supply chain, we see improvements and some very nice improvement in some area. But that supply chain was hit hard by COVID. And I think a little bit of explanation there is helpful. COVID impacted that supply chain, Virginia supply chain, in particular, in a couple of ways. Obviously, the impact of COVID itself, the workforce disruption. Then we had the large demographic changeover. And finally, Virginia was impacted by the Columbia prioritization. All of that made it difficult for that supply chain to begin to get back on cadence. They're getting better, but we've got a while to go before they hit their 2-a-year or more cadence.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.Peter J. ArmentGood morning, Phebe and Jason. Congrats, Howard. Phebe, within Combat, munitions kind of is viewed as a potential source of kind of upside volume, and thanks for all the color on the segment. But how should we be thinking about the munitions growth profile? I mean, it's about finished last year, about 27% of your mix. Do you expect that mix to continue to grow? And any comments on the supply chain there as my follow-up, just because I know there's been talk about challenges there.Phebe N. NovakovicThe supply chain in the Combat group has been less of an issue. I suspect that the -- at least for the foreseeable future, the munitions portion of the business will remain about that, same as we see uplift in all of our all 3 businesses. We'll see OTS at about that same level. We've already increased munitions capacity and working with the federal government and the Army and OSD in particular, we have a very detailed plan to further increase capacity, which will allow us then to increase production very rapidly and move to the left, the munition availability to meet the United States' needs and, frankly, external needs as well.Howard Alan RubelOperator, we'll just take 1 more question, please.OperatorAnd our final question for today comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.George D. ShapiroCongratulations, Howard. I didn't figure I'd outlast you, but we've known each other a lot of years and...Howard Alan RubelGeorge, it's over 40. Just counting.George D. ShapiroThat's right. Phebe, on the default that you mentioned, can you just mention what kind of customers they might have been? And I assume you keep the down payments that might have been made on the aircraft that they order?Phebe N. NovakovicSo I think you know we have very strong terms and conditions that you forfeit some of your value in the airplane when you cancel. I don't actually know the context of the default, that won't -- nothing that was of note or interest, otherwise, I'd know it.George D. ShapiroOkay. And Jason, the unbilled receivables was actually up like $100 million sequentially. So does that mean you didn't get any payments from the expected customers in the quarter? And how much would you expect the rest of the year to come in?Jason W. AikenActually, George, we did receive additional payments on schedule as per the plan that was set forth several years ago. And I'm actually happy to tell you that at this point -- and maybe this terminates this line of dialogue for the foreseeable future -- the arrears that you all may remember from many years ago on that Canadian international program has now effectively been paid down, and we are down to what I would call a normal run rate of operating working capital on that program. So I'm pleased to report that we've passed through that phase. In terms of what we expect to receive for the balance of the year, there are some more progress payments to come in, but I don't have that quantified off the top of my head.George D. ShapiroSomething you had kind of given what the specifics were on that in the queue.Howard Alan RubelWe'll follow up on that. Operator, that now ends the call. And for those that are interested in connecting later, or have follow-up questions. Please don't hesitate to call me. Thank you for joining our call today.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Growth Stocks: 10 Aristocrats.Dividend investing is a specialized approach that yields rewards primarily for patient investors and may not suit everyone. When investing in dividend stocks, seasoned investors pay attention to growth in their payouts over the years. Through this, they aim to benefit through a combination of growing income stream, capital appreciation, and protection against inflation. Returns of dividend growth stocks have surpassed those without any growth tracks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned RMB Capital’s research which revealed that dividend growers achieved a positive return of 9.62% from 1972 until December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79% during the same period.According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers exhibited lower volatility over the last 50 years. Due to this, many financial experts are now recommending the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental part of equity portfolios for their clients. The consistent growth and stability of dividends make them an attractive option for investors seeking reliable long-term returns. From 1973 to 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return to shareholders, whereas dividend payers and dividend non-payers returned 9.18% and -0.60%, respectively. To learn more about dividend growth stocks, have a look at 12 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend Growth.Dividend aristocrat stocks are excellent choices for dividend growth investment due to their consistent and impressive track record of increasing dividends over an extended period. These S&amp;P 500 companies have raised their payouts for 25 years or more and have stable cash flows which highlights their ability to increase dividends in the future as well. Last year’s inflation affected almost every sector, but dividend aristocrats performed better than most other types of investments. Though the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index also ended the year with losses, it still managed to outperform the S&amp;P 500, which recorded its worst performance since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $2.75 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.25%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.General Dynamics shares have lost about 12.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19%.What's Next for General Dynamics?While General Dynamics has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for General Dynamics: unfavorable.

(NYSE: NOV) today reported second quarter 2023 revenues of $2.09 billion, an increase of seven percent compared to the first quarter of 2023 and an increase of 21 percent compared to the second quarter of 2022. Net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $155 million, or 7.4 percent of sales. Operating profit was $181 million, or 8.6 percent of sales. Under Other Items the Company recorded a net pre-tax credit of $7 million (see Corporate Information for additional details). Adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially to $245 million, or 11.7 percent of sales.""NOV’s consolidated revenue increased seven percent sequentially, which helped lift fully diluted earnings per share to the highest level since 2015,"" stated Clay Williams, Chairman, President, and CEO. ""Rising demand in offshore and international land markets led to a two percent sequential increase in capital equipment orders for the Company, despite economic uncertainty and continued declines in North American rig activity. We believe the substantial backlog of oil and gas development projects across offshore and international land markets will continue to push oilfield service asset utilization higher, prompting continued demand for NOV’s critical equipment and technologies.""""Encouragingly, the Company’s global supply chain is continuing to improve, which is positively impacting sales growth and profitability. However, compressing delivery times from most, but not all, of our vendors led to higher inventories in the second quarter, which contributed to NOV’s working capital growth and cash draw. We expect inventory balances to remain elevated as supply chains normalize, before reversing out in the fourth quarter. As the pace of customer backlog conversion accelerates through the second half of the year, we expect both improved profitability and sequentially improving free cash flow, particularly in the fourth quarter and continuing into 2024.""Story continuesWellbore TechnologiesWellbore Technologies generated revenues of $804 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of eight percent from the first quarter of 2023 and an increase of 21 percent from the second quarter of 2022. Operating profit was $128 million, or 15.9 percent of sales, and included a credit of $1 million from Other Items. Adjusted EBITDA increased $31 million sequentially and increased $42 million from the prior year to $164 million, or 20.4 percent of sales. Significantly improved manufacturing throughput from the segment’s drill pipe operations, market share gains and improving demand from international and offshore markets offset activity declines in North America to drive improved results.Completion &amp; Production SolutionsCompletion &amp; Production Solutions generated revenues of $753 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of five percent from the first quarter of 2023 and an increase of 18 percent from the second quarter of 2022. Operating profit was $53 million, or 7.0 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased $15 million sequentially and increased $37 million from the prior year to $69 million, or 9.2 percent of sales. Results reflect improving execution on a higher margin mix of international and offshore projects, partially offset by softening demand for completion equipment and aftermarket services in North America.New orders booked during the quarter increased 11 percent and totaled $450 million, representing a book-to-bill of 94 percent when compared to the $477 million of orders shipped from backlog. As of June 30, 2023, backlog for capital equipment orders for Completion &amp; Production Solutions was $1.59 billion, a decrease of $15 million from the first quarter of 2023 and an increase of $144 million from the second quarter of 2022.Rig TechnologiesRig Technologies generated revenues of $606 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 10 percent from the first quarter of 2023 and an increase of 31 percent from the second quarter of 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million sequentially and increased $30 million from the prior year to $71 million, or 11.7 percent of sales. Steadily improving demand drove the segment’s sequential revenue growth. Incremental margins were limited by a lower margin sales mix and sequentially higher costs related to a startup operation.New capital equipment orders booked during the quarter totaled $222 million, representing a book-to-bill of 108 percent when compared to the $205 million of orders shipped from backlog. As of June 30, 2023, backlog for capital equipment orders for Rig Technologies totaled $2.89 billion, an increase of $17 million from the first quarter of 2023 and an increase of $54 million from the second quarter of 2022.Corporate InformationNOV recorded a net credit of $7 million in Other Items, primarily related to gains on sales of previously reserved inventory (see Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income) during the second quarter.As of June 30, 2023, the Company had total debt of $1.73 billion, with $2.00 billion available on its primary revolving credit facility, and $592 million in cash and cash equivalents.As previously disclosed, the Company is currently pursuing litigation against several companies involving royalties due under licenses for technology related to drill bits. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company accrued an incremental $10 million of accounts receivable owed by non-paying licensees, bringing the total amount accrued to $52 million.Significant AchievementsNOV entered a global arrangement with a major Integrated Oil Company (IOC), to provide the customer with capabilities of NOV’s MaxTM digital platform. The Max platform provides edge compute, edge-to-cloud and cloud-based solutions that enable real-time insights to drive operational efficiencies in the field. The currently deployed solutions include: NOV’s Kaizen™ Intelligent Drilling Optimizer, which employs artificial intelligence with continuously learning capabilities that enable it to provide proactive drilling dysfunction mitigation, maximize rate of penetration (ROP), and optimize mechanical specific energy (MSE); WellData 4.0™ Remote Drilling Monitor, which allows real-time monitoring of drilling information anywhere in the world as if at the wellsite; and RigSense 4.0™ Electronic Drilling Recorder, the industry’s most versatile rig-site information system.NOV’s automation and robotics suite continues to gather market momentum as customers begin to benefit from its ability to drive significant performance and safety improvements. During the quarter, NOV secured multiple system orders for rigs operating in markets around the globe, ranging from a land rig system in North America to automation and robotic systems for deepwater drilling rigs operating in South America and Southeast Asia. Following the installation of the new systems, these customers will all benefit from NOV’s Automation Lifecycle Management program and round-the-clock support from the Performance Center, a dedicated NOV team that utilizes NOV’s unparalleled library of rig performance data to optimize rig configurations and drilling methodologies.NOV has recently signed orders to supply 11 top drives and 10 iron roughnecks for land rigs operating in the Middle East. These orders reflect NOV’s commitment to providing advanced drilling equipment and technologies to enhance operational efficiency in the region.NOV’s Fiber Glass Systems has been chosen to provide support for the Fuji Borealis Project. The project, which will feature the Pipex™ Chemsafe PP-H Dual Contained Drainage System, will provide process waste, biowaste, and segregated drainage for a large bio-tech facility. NOV Fiber Glass Systems’ differentiated offerings allow it to meet the specific requirement for biowaste systems containing live pathogens.NOV continues to develop and advance the next generation of fracturing technology. During the quarter, the NOV Ideal™ Power Pod, a hybrid solution that enables scalable eFrac deployments alongside conventional frac units and provides up to 15,000 horsepower per pod, was successfully deployed in the Marcellus Basin with a large independent service provider. The Power Pod can eliminate the need for up to eight conventional units, resulting in fuel savings of approximately 800 gallons of diesel per hour and a redzone footprint decrease of 50%. When employed alongside a conventional dual-fuel fleet, the Power Pod system allows for optimal consumption of natural gas fuel across the entire fleet, leading to further reductions in diesel consumption and emissions.NOV continued to strengthen its position as a global leader in the provision of carbon-reducing marine and heavy lift equipment and technology. During the quarter, NOV secured orders for eight third-generation all-electric cranes from multiple major operators, an indication of the growing global recognition and acceptance of NOV’s dependable all-electric crane. Additionally, NOV secured a contract for the provision of slewing and tilting systems for two sail masts on a large vessel, enabling a European client to reduce the carbon footprint of its shipping fleet.NOV secured the first sale of its XCalibur™ connection, a threaded and coupled connector designed specifically for use in geothermal operation, in the North American market. XCalibur has a gas-tight, metal-to-metal seal, adding to the XL Systems family of large-diameter casing and connector products. The XCalibur connection features an integral pin with double-start threads and a high strength forged coupling, ensuring robust performance and 100% pipe body strength in challenging onshore and offshore critical-service casing applications.NOV’s PosiTrack™ Torsional Vibration Mitigation tool continues to set new performance benchmarks on rotary steerable systems (RSS) and motor bottomhole assemblies (BHA) with major operators and directional companies in North and South America. In addition to improving and maintaining RSS directional control in the most demanding applications, the PosiTrack tool enables customers to extend the mean time between equipment failures on RSS, measurement-while-drilling, and logging-while-drilling operations. The new technology has also succeeded in enhancing borehole enlargement applications, where balancing dual-cutting structures, bit, and reamer in the BHA is the main challenge. By mitigating torsional vibrations, RSS tools were kept in the hole longer while achieving competitive ROP.NOV secured an order from a Fortune 500 independent midstream infrastructure company in North America for Tuboscope™ TK™-70 and TK-70XT coating with 24-in. Thru-Kote™ sleeves for a brine piping project in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Used in the construction of internally coated pipelines, Thru-Kote’s insert sleeve protects the internal coating during welding, improving connection integrity and providing a continuous coating barrier. The layout of the new system, combined with TK coatings and Thru-Kote sleeves, will greatly improve pumping efficiencies and provide exceptional corrosion and abrasion protection. Additionally, another major operator placed an order for the new Tuboscope TK-340TC drill pipe coating. After exceeding performance expectations in a drilling trial, the low thermal conductivity coating was chosen for its ability to insulate drilling fluids, provide corrosion protection, and improve hydraulic efficiencies. As the market leader in tubular corrosion control, Tuboscope is committed to providing coating solutions for the most challenging environments.NOV received multiple contract awards for its Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) products as it establishes itself as a market leader in the space. A national oil company in the Asia Pacific region extended its contract for an additional 10-well campaign, securing two sets of Land Rotating Control Devices (LRCD)/Pressure Mud Cap Drilling systems.

Additionally, a major operator chose to replace a competitor system with our J-Series RCD system on a tension leg platform, confirming its reputation for reliability and performance. The team also executed a deepwater Integrated Riser Joint (IRJ) upgrade for a major drilling contractor, which included making the NControl™ platform the primary MPD software platform. In addition, a major drilling contractor purchased its fifth IRJ system.NOV further strengthened its data aggregation and delivery business in the Middle East by securing two key purchase orders. The M/D Totco business unit will supply RigSense technology to a national oil company’s 10 new-build rigs and deliver RigSense upgrades for 27 offshore rigs belonging to an international drilling contractor. Furthermore, NOV garnered maintenance and licensing orders from major coiled tubing service companies, international oil companies, and international wireline service providers for its OrionNET, Max Completions™, and Cerberus™ well intervention software, further highlighting NOV’s significant achievements in the field of surface sensors.Second Quarter Earnings Conference CallNOV will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2023 results on July 27, 2023 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern Time).

185,3fae9e79-d025-361d-ba1e-d99beb55a643,WYNN,2023-07-27,Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn to pay $10M to end fight over claims of sexual misconduct,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-casino-mogul-steve-040739844.html,1690430859,STORY,"['WYNN', 'WYNMY']","[LAS VEGAS (AP) — Casino mogul Steve Wynn has ended a yearslong legal fight with Nevada gambling regulators that started with claims of workplace sexual misconduct, agreeing to pay a $10 million fine and cut ties to the industry he helped shape in Las Vegas.The Nevada Gaming Commission accepted a settlement Thursday to end the state’s look at allegations that led to Wynn’s resignation from his corporate empire in February 2018. Wynn admitted no wrongdoing. The decision was 4-0. Commission Chairwoman Jennifer Togliatti abstained from voting, citing a conflict arising from her previous work as a state court mediator.Wynn is now 81 and lives in Florida. He did not attend the hearing held in Carson City and livestreamed on the internet. His attorney, Colby Williams, called the case the final regulatory matter that Wynn faced stemming from the allegations five years ago.Wynn “looks forward to moving on to other phases of his life,” Williams told The Associated Press.The fine is the largest ever imposed by the commission, second only to $20 million paid in February 2019 by Wynn’s former company, Wynn Resorts Ltd., for failing to investigate the sexual misconduct claims made against Wynn.Craig Newby, first assistant Nevada attorney general, reminded the commission that a seven-month investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board ""found evidence of sexual conduct by Mr. Wynn involving some subordinate female employees.”“This stipulation,"" Newby said, ”would bring this sordid affair to conclusion.”“It's a huge blemish on the (casino) industry,” Commissioner Rosa Solis-Rainey said. “While Mr. Wynn made some incredible contributions, the nature of the allegations that were made and the history behind that ... warrant at least the amount of fine that was negotiated.""“I think it's in everybody's best interest to move forward,” she said.Forbes puts Wynn's net worth at $3.2 billion, among the top 400 of its ranking of richest Americans.Story continuesWynn signed a seven-page document on July 17 acknowledging he had been accused of “failure to exercise discretion and sound judgment” to prevent actions that “reflected negatively on the reputation” of Nevada and its gambling industry.Violating the agreement could lead to a finding of “unsuitability” for association with Nevada casinos and an additional fine.“Unsuitability” would be extraordinary for a man widely credited with starting a boom that grew Las Vegas Strip properties from gambling halls with all-you-can-eat buffets and showrooms into huge destination resorts featuring celebrity-chef restaurants, massive gambling floors, nightclubs and huge stage productions.Wynn developed luxury properties including the Golden Nugget, Mirage, Treasure Island, Bellagio, Wynn and Encore in Las Vegas; Golden Nugget in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Wynn Macau in the Chinese gambling enclave; and Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts.He resigned after the Wall Street Journal published allegations by several women that he sexually harassed or assaulted them at his hotels. He divested company shares, quit the corporate board and resigned as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee.Wynn has consistently denied sexual misconduct allegations in multiple courts.In the Gaming Commission case, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled against him in March 2022, finding that a state judge in Las Vegas acted prematurely in late 2020 when she sided with Wynn’s lawyers and decided the state lacked authority to punish him.Wynn's attorneys, also including Donald Campbell, argued that the Gaming Control Board and Gaming Commission no longer had legal jurisdiction over Wynn.State regulators launched their investigation after the allegations against Wynn emerged. The board said Wynn’s license had been placed on administrative hold and the commission moved in October 2019 to discipline or fine Wynn.At a December 2019 hearing, which Wynn did not attend, commissioners began considering a fine of up to $500,000 and a declaration that Wynn was unsuitable to renew ties to gambling in Nevada.Months earlier, the commission fined his former company the record $20 million.Massachusetts gambling regulators fined Wynn Resorts Ltd. another $35 million and new company chief executive Matthew Maddox $500,000 for failing to disclose while applying for a license for the Boston-area resort that there had been sexual misconduct allegations against Wynn.Wynn Resorts agreed in November 2019 to accept $20 million in damages from Wynn and $21 million more from insurance carriers on behalf of current and former employees of Wynn Resorts to settle shareholder lawsuits accusing company directors of failing to disclose misconduct allegations.The agreements included no admission of wrongdoing.]"

189,aee7fda8-dd7b-3fd1-b0e0-a68b16c0654c,ZTS,2023-07-27,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Zoetis Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-zoetis-123005488.html,1690374605,STORY,['ZTS'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Zoetis (ZTS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ZTS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Zoetis' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Zoetis' main business drivers.Florham Park, NJ-based Zoetis Inc. came into existence following Pfizer’s decision to spin off its animal health business. The entity started trading on NYSE on Feb 1, 2013, under the name Zoetis. The company is a leader in the animal health space with a focus on both livestock and companion animals in seven major product categories: vaccines, anti-infectives, parasiticides, dermatology, other pharmaceutical products, medicated feed additives and animal health diagnostics. Zoetis has a diversified business, which caters to eight core species — cattle, swine, poultry, fish and sheep (collectively, livestock) and dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals).The outstanding growth rate in the companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics sector is being driven by economic development, related increases in disposable income and a rise in pet ownership and spending on pet care.Zoetis has been working on strengthening its product portfolio through acquisitions and deals. In 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Jurox, an animal health company based in Australia, which brings the company a range of companion animal and livestock products and provides the company with future growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity and increased capabilities in Australia. Also in 2022, the company acquired Basepaws, a petcare genetics company that provides pet owners with genetic tests, analytics and early health risk assessments, which help pet owners and veterinarians understand an individual pet’s risk for disease and can lead to more meaningful engagements and increased likelihood of early detection and treatment of disease.Zoetis has consolidated its four-region structure into a two-region structure, namely the United States and International. Total revenues grew 4% year over year to $8.1 billion in 2022. The United States contributed 53% of total revenues in 2022 while international revenues contributed the rest.In 2022, Zoetis’ two top-selling products and product lines were Simparica/Simparica Trio and Apoquel, which contributed approximately 12% and 10%, respectively, of its revenue. Also in 2022, Zoetis recorded 15 products and product lines with revenues of $100 million or more.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Zoetis ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $6,230.34, or a 523.03% gain, as of July 26, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 170.22% and gold's return of 41.77% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ZTS too. Zoetis has an innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides, including Simparica Trio and key dermatology products that maintain momentum for the company. The strong uptake of Librela and Solensia in Europe, its new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging. The launch of innovative products bolstered the portfolio and should fuel growth. The recent approval of the Apoquel chewable tablet for dermatitis indication should boost sales. However, the company had earlier faced supply challenges which impacted demand. Despite constraints being eased out, a similar situation will restrain growth. Stiff competition from animal health business wings of Merck and Bayer remains a woe. Shares have outperformed in the industry in the year-to-date period. Our estimates for Zoetis’ revenues suggest a CAGR growth of 7.5% over the next three years. The stock has jumped 11.41% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although numbers were down year over year due to difficult comparison, most firms’ results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top and the bottom line. The sector has been banking on improving demand for housing and remodelling activities and solid growth in the infrastructural and public construction spending.The rising demand for non-residential and infrastructural activities for public project work are expected to have supported growth. Other factors like favorable weather, prudent cost-saving efforts, a disciplined approach to bidding, project management, strength in funding programs across the states and rapid fiber deployments are added positives. These above-mentioned tailwinds are expected to have contributed to the quarterly performances of Masco Corporation MAS, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Weyerhaeuser Company WY, Meritage Homes Corporation MTH and Eagle Materials Inc. EXP, due on Jul 27.Yet, supply-chain woes, material and labor constraints and project delays are a concern.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, construction sector earnings are expected to decline 24.4% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter, compared with 19.1% fall registered in first-quarter 2023. Revenues are projected to slip 0.4% year over year, versus a rise of 2.8% registered in the last reported quarter.A Handful of Construction Stocks to WatchA handful of companies from the construction space are likely to release their respective quarterly results on Jul 27. Let’s take a quick glance at how these stocks are poised ahead of their respective earnings release.According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has moved up to 96 cents from 95 cents in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 15.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s level. For net sales, the consensus mark is pegged at $2.1 billion, suggesting a decline of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesMasco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Masco Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMasco Corporation price-eps-surprise | Masco Corporation Quote Masco is likely to have witnessed lower net sales on a year-over-year basis in second-quarter 2023.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SPGI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.18 per share for SPGI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.12 per share.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence And The Stock MarketThe stock market has been through a lot in the past few years, what with geopolitical tensions, interest rates and inflation, and a pandemic to boot, all being fast on its tail. Despite these significant challenges, the markets have managed to bounce back in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 having risen by 1.47 points or 0.032%, the Nasdaq Composite rising by 27.49 points or 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average being up by 2.51 points or 0.007%, all on July 24. The success of the markets has largely been based on a larger narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), specifically generative AI and other similar technology. Considering the wide-ranging impact of AI on the markets, investors and finance-minded individuals, in general, are looking at this technology as a way to make the most money they can while they still have the chance.On July 10, CNBC quoted Matt Higgins, a self-made millionaire and the CEO of investment firm RSE Ventures, as commenting that ""AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history."" According to Higgins, this technology has no regard for an individual's background or anything else, giving the global public a chance to try their own hand at making money without any barriers holding them back. Higgins is also not the only person to believe in AI as a money-making technology, as people all across the world are becoming engaged in things like freelancing and entrepreneurship with the help of AI today. At the same time, investors are considering this technology as the turning point in the business journeys of many companies. AI is presenting all sorts of possibilities to a variety of companies today, allowing them to innovate and come up with different products and services that can get them back in demand with consumers and investors alike. This is why many stocks that have remained under the radar for investors for a long time are now beginning to make a name for themselves again.Story continuesHow Are Overlooked Stocks Playing The AI Boom?Many companies, like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), have been using AI to their advantage. These moves have started to garner support for these companies in light of their stellar financial profiles and their efforts to play the AI boom in their favor. Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), for instance, has been using AI to track plants across different weather, soil types, and sun exposure to see the impact of these different conditions on plants for its agricultural operations. The company's latest earnings report from the second quarter also showed that it beat EPS estimates by $1.18 with its $9.65 EPS, while its revenue of $16.08 billion also beat estimates by $1.21 billion. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) has a similar story with a $9.38 EPS in the first quarter beating estimates by $0.18, and revenues of $26.74 billion, also beating estimates by $344.84 million, while the company is also engaged in AI operations.Stocks like these have solid profiles, and their recent ventures in the AI space are making professionals consider them to be some of the best under-the-radar stocks to buy if you're looking to pick up stocks that can play the AI boom. Considering the immense growth potential companies like these seem to have, they may even be considered to be some of the best undervalued stocks to buy now or some of the top undervalued stocks in the S&amp;P 500 overall. Keeping this in mind, we have compiled a list of 11 such stocks below.11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe first picked 25 stocks named by other sources online as some of the top under-the-radar stocks on the market today. We then shortlisted 11 stocks from this list by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, based on which stocks had the most hedge fund investors. They are ranked based on this metric as well, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11۔ Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) is a communication services and broadcasting company based in New York. The company operates through its Cable Network Programming, Television, and Other, Corporate, and Eliminations segments. It offers live news, sports coverage, and entertainment.Analysts today consider Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) a stock with significant underappreciated upside potential. Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, holds an Equal Weight rating on the stock as of June 6. The analyst also has a price target of $36 on the shares.There were 32 hedge funds long Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $422.1 million.10۔ Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34An Overweight rating was maintained on shares of Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) on July 12 by Joshua Pokrzywinski at Morgan Stanley. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $335 to $340.Bank of America named Rockwell Automation Inc.

The company has a strong brand, installed base and distribution network and is expanding its product offering to include more cloud-based software to complement its leading hardware business. In the coming years, we expect the company to benefit from an acceleration in US manufacturing investment to support customers’ nearshoring initiatives and in response to federal government incentive programs to manufacture energy transition products domestically. In addition, we expect Rockwell to experience revenue and margin tailwinds in 2023 from easing supply chain constraints, which limited its ability to meet customer demand in 2022.”Like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is an overlooked stock that is popular among hedge funds this year.9. Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39In the first quarter, 39 hedge funds were long Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), with a total stake value of $1.4 billion.Equinix, Inc.

The shares are valued at a small premium to REITs, despite superior and more durable cash-flow growth prospects.”8. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Orbis Investment Management was the most prominent shareholder in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) at the end of the first quarter, holding 7.2 million shares in the company.Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish maintains an Overweight rating on shares of Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

Their total stake value in the company was $2.2 billion.Here's what LVS Advisory said about Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also modestly added to our position in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in the mid-$70s. We initiated our Interactive Brokers position last summer and published a write-up in September 2022. Interactive Brokers continues to trade at a discounted multiple as investors are skeptical that the company will continue to sustain the current level of net interest income beyond the near future. However, recent reports showing strength in the US economy and labor market suggest that interest rates won’t be cut in the near term. The company publishes monthly KPI metrics and investors appear to be ignoring recent strength in trading volume and margin loans. The current market environment of rising stock prices and elevated interest rates is a goldilocks environment for the company. With this last buy, we have now reached our limit of investing 10% of our portfolio at cost in the stock and can no longer increase the holding size.”7. LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is another investment banking and brokerage company on our list. It is based in San Diego, California. The company offers an integrated platform of brokerage and investment advisory services to independent financial advisors and others in the US.Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 52 hedge funds long LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:LPLA) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is the largest independent broker-dealer in the U.S. Following a strong run in 2022, the stock detracted in the quarter. The weakness was largely driven by turmoil in the banking industry after the failure of SVB, which caused investors to sour on financial stocks in general. We believe LPL is immune from most of the issues facing banks. LPL is not a bank itself, has a relatively small balance sheet, and has a low-risk, short-duration securities portfolio. The banking crisis has caused investors to take a more dovish view on the path of interest rates, which is a headwind to LPL’s earnings as the economics on a large portion of client cash is tied to floating rates. However, we believe the company has an attractive growth profile even in a lower interest rate environment.”6. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62A total of 62 hedge funds were long Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.1 billion.Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is a consumer discretionary company operating in the hotels, resorts, and cruise lines industry.

The company offers a wide range of travel shopping and reservation services, as well as provides real-time access to schedule, pricing and availability information for airlines, hotels and car rental companies. Expedia serves customers worldwide.We see Expedia benefiting from the growth of booking travel online, both for leisure and in corporate travel. The company also benefits from rapid growth in alternative accommodations, vacation home rental, through VRBO. The main sources of revenue and profitability are from hotel and vacation home rental. Additionally Expedia has exposure to airline ticket sales and automobile rentals. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, Expedia’s debt has been reduced and share repurchase has resumed and we would expect a dividend to be reinstated.”Like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is an under-the-radar stock that many elite hedge funds have been piling into in 2023.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:10 Overlooked Large-Cap Stocks with Cheap Multiples10 Undervalued Canadian Stocks To Invest In12 Undervalued European Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The FTC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.With the Ukraine war driving up demand for missiles and defense systems, Aerojet became an attractive takeover target.In 2022, Lockheed Martin walked away from its deal with Aerojet after antitrust regulators sued to block it on competition concerns.On Wednesday, L3Harris raised its annual revenue forecast to between $18 billion and $18.3 billion, from $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion estimated earlier.L3Harris now expects profit to be between $12.15 and $12.55 per share, from $12 to $12.50 estimated earlier.Formed by the merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corp in 2019, the defense contractor's customers include the Pentagon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and RTX Corp.

The project will represent a rapid advancement in propulsion technology to benefit exploration and national defense.DARPA has selected Lockheed Martin to develop a nuclear powered demonstration spacecraftDARPA partnered with NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate on the DRACO project, as both agencies will benefit from this leading edge technology. The in-space flight demonstration of a nuclear thermal rocket engine vehicle will take place no later than 2027.Faster, Farther, More AgileChemical propulsion engines have long been the standard for spaceflight, but for humans to travel to Mars, they will need much more powerful and efficient propulsion. Nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) engines offer thrust as high as conventional chemical propulsion with two-to-five times higher efficiency, which means the spacecraft can travel faster and farther and can significantly reduce propellant needs. They also enable abort scenarios on journeys to Mars that are not possible with chemical propulsion systems.""These more powerful and efficient nuclear thermal propulsion systems can provide faster transit times between destinations. Reducing transit time is vital for human missions to Mars to limit a crew's exposure to radiation,"" said Kirk Shireman, vice president of Lunar Exploration Campaigns at Lockheed Martin Space. ""This is a prime technology that can be used to transport humans and materials to the Moon. A safe, reusable nuclear tug spacecraft would revolutionize cislunar operations. With more speed, agility and maneuverability, nuclear thermal propulsion also has many national security applications for cislunar space.""Story continuesSafe and Efficient Nuclear TechAn NTP system uses a nuclear reactor to quickly heat hydrogen propellant to very high temperatures and then funnels that gas through the engine nozzle to create powerful thrust. The fission-based reactor will use a special high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, to convert the cryogenic hydrogen into an extremely hot pressurized gas. The reactor will not be turned on until the spacecraft has reached a nuclear safe orbit, making the NTP system very safe.Lockheed Martin has partnered with BWX Technologies to develop the nuclear reactor and produce the HALEU fuel.""In the past several years, BWXT has been maturing its nuclear thermal propulsion fuel and design, and we are excited to further expand into space with our ability to deliver nuclear products and capabilities to the U.S. Government, "" said Joe Miller, BWXT Advanced Technologies LLC president. ""We look forward to building the reactor and manufacturing the fuel at our Lynchburg, Virginia, facilities.""While nuclear systems are an emerging field, Lockheed Martin has a long history and expertise in nuclear controls and has built many of NASA's radioisotope thermoelectric generators for NASA's planetary missions. Lockheed Martin has also invested heavily in cryogenic hydrogen storage and transfer. This key technology will be needed in deep space exploration not only for NTP, but for conventional propulsion systems.Illustrations: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lockheedmartin/sets/72177720310050928Animations: https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/829198706/45f0fd0981YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSIlLUKiiGEAbout Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 116,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation, @LMSpace to learn more about the latest technologies, missions and people driving the future of space.Lockheed Martin Logo.

(NYSE:BAX), a global medtech leader, today reported results for the second quarter of 2023.""Baxter’s second-quarter performance reflects ongoing solid demand for our diverse, durable portfolio of medically essential products,"" said José (Joe) E. Almeida, chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""We are making progress across the transformational actions we announced at the start of 2023. These initiatives are focused on enhancing strategic clarity, increasing market responsiveness and accelerating innovation, in an effort to drive greater value for our stakeholders.""Second-Quarter Financial ResultsWorldwide sales from continuing operations in the second quarter totaled approximately $3.71 billion and sales from discontinued operations totaled $142 million in the quarter. This performance represented an increase of 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis, both for continuing operations and in the aggregate. Discontinued operations include Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions (BPS) business, which is currently expected to be divested in the second half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, as announced on May 8, 2023. See ""Recent Highlights"" later in this release for more information about the pending BPS divestiture.U.S. sales from continuing operations in the second quarter totaled approximately $1.75 billion and discontinued operations totaled $64 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% on a reported basis, both for continuing operations and in the aggregate. International sales from continuing operations in the second quarter totaled approximately $1.96 billion and discontinued operations totaled $78 million in the quarter, representing increases of 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis for continuing operations, and 3% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis in the aggregate.Story continuesSales performance in the quarter came in ahead of Baxter’s previously announced second-quarter 2023 guidance, driven by overall positive demand for Baxter products, reflecting ongoing recovery in patient and procedure volumes, alongside generally stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and an ongoing abatement in recent supply chain challenges. Sales growth in the second quarter was driven primarily by high single-digit growth at constant currency rates in Front Line Care, Surgical Solutions, Medication Delivery, and Clinical Nutrition; and mid-single-digit growth at constant currency rates in Acute Therapies and Advanced Surgery. Second-quarter performance was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Patient Support Systems, primarily resulting from lower rental revenues, as well as lower sales in BPS (reported in discontinued operations) due to a reduction in COVID vaccine manufacturing revenues.Please see the attached schedules accompanying this press release for additional details on sales performance in the quarter, including breakouts by Baxter’s product categories and segments.For the second quarter, total net income attributable to Baxter was ($141 million), or ($0.28) per diluted share, a decline of 156% from the prior-year period on a U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis. Total U.S. GAAP diluted EPS includes ($0.39) from continuing operations and $0.11 from discontinued operations. These results include special items totaling $476 million after tax, which were primarily related to business optimization costs and intangible amortization, among other factors. On an adjusted basis, total net income attributable to Baxter was $335 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, a 24% decline for the quarter as compared to the prior-year period. Total adjusted diluted EPS includes $0.55 from continuing operations and $0.11 from discontinued operations. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter exceeded Baxter’s previously announced second-quarter 2023 guidance, driven by better-than-expected sales performance and operational efficiencies.Kidney Care Spinoff UpdateAs announced Jan. 6, 2023, Baxter is preparing to spin off its Renal Care and Acute Therapies global businesses (Kidney Care) into an independent, publicly traded company. The new company is poised to launch with a leading product portfolio, geographically diverse footprint, extensive commercial operations, and robust service capabilities supporting its therapies, which are delivered in homes, clinics, and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. As a standalone entity, the company should benefit from heightened management focus and the ability to pursue its unique investment priorities, emerging better positioned to accelerate growth and innovation and create incremental value for its patients, clinicians, investors, and other stakeholder communities.In May, Chris Toth was named as the inaugural chief executive officer of the planned spinoff company. Mr. Toth most recently served as chief executive officer of Varian, a Siemens Healthineers company. He joined Baxter in June and will serve as executive vice president and group president, Kidney Care, until completion of the proposed spinoff.Earlier this week, Baxter also announced that the new company will be named Vantive, with the logo and full visual identity to be unveiled at a later date. Until separation, the relevant businesses will continue to operate as Baxter.Beyond these critical milestones, the underlying work of the spinoff continues. The new company’s operating model and organizational design are being finalized, and progress is ongoing across legal, regulatory, supply chain, and numerous other key operational channels. The spinoff, which remains subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, is currently expected to occur by July 2024 or earlier.Recent Highlights2Baxter continues to advance key strategic priorities in pursuit of its Mission to Save and Sustain Lives. Among recent highlights, the company:Signed a definitive agreement to divest its BioPharma Solutions (BPS) business to Advent International, one of the largest and most experienced global private equity investors, and Warburg Pincus, a leading global growth investor. The pending divestiture of BPS will further streamline Baxter’s strategic focus and represents an important milestone in Baxter’s ongoing business transformation. Baxter plans to deploy net after-tax proceeds of the transaction for debt repayment, consistent with the company’s stated capital allocation priorities. The transaction is currently expected to close in the second half of 2023, subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions.Launched its next-generation Hillrom Progressa+ ICU bed in the U.S. Progressa+ offers new technology and features to help address complex critical care needs, including in-bed pulmonary therapies designed to aid in the reduction of pulmonary complications, improved protection of the patient’s skin to help prevent pressure injuries, and support for early mobility protocols. Baxter plans to launch Progressa+ in additional global markets over the next 18 months.Announced the FDA Premarket Approval (PMA) and subsequent U.S. launch of its PERCLOT Absorbable Hemostatic Powder. PERCLOT is a passive, absorbable hemostatic powder that is ready to use and designed for patients with intact coagulation to address mild bleeding. This represents Baxter’s first passive hemostat in the U.S. market, broadening Baxter’s portfolio to include a full range of active and passive solutions.Annual Corporate Responsibility ReportIn June, Baxter released its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, featuring performance updates on the company’s 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment and Goals. The report reflects Baxter’s first year of integration with Hillrom, demonstrating how the combined team has united in support of a shared commitment to ""Empower our Patients,"" ""Protect our Planet,"" and ""Champion our People and Communities.""Building on more than three decades of reporting environmental performance, Baxter has announced plans to further enhance its transparency and disclosures by reporting against the framework established by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in a standalone publication later this year.2023 Financial Outlook and AssumptionsFor Full-Year 2023The Company’s current expectation is that the pending sale of BPS is likely to close towards the end of the third quarter. However, as the ultimate timing is uncertain, and to provide comparability to prior guidance, it is providing a financial outlook that also contemplates a scenario in which the transaction does not close in 2023. Under either scenario, BPS is reflected as a discontinued operation, consistent with its presentation throughout this release and the accompanying tables. Adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts referred to below exclude special items.Scenario 1: BPS Remains a Part of Baxter Through Full-Year 2023Under this scenario, Baxter expects full-year 2023 sales growth from continuing operations of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and approximately 2% on a constant currency basis. Under this scenario, sales growth in aggregate (including discontinued operations) would be the same as continuing operations on both a reported and constant currency basis.Under this scenario, Baxter expects full-year 2023 adjusted earnings on an aggregate basis (including discontinued operations) of $2.92 to $3.00 per diluted share and adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.49 to $2.57 per diluted share.Scenario 2: The Pending BPS Sale is Completed on September 30, 2023Under this scenario, there is no change to sales growth for continuing operations and sales growth in aggregate (including discontinued operations) would be approximately flat to 1% on a reported basis and approximately 1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the absence of BPS sales in the fourth quarter.Under this scenario, Baxter expects full-year 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.87 to $2.95 per diluted share in the aggregate (including discontinued operations) and adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share. Baxter’s full-year 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share outlook in the aggregate reflects a $0.10 per share negative impact from the absence of BPS earnings in the fourth quarter. The company’s outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share in the aggregate and for continuing operations both reflect a net benefit of approximately $0.05, primarily due to reduced interest expense after giving effect to anticipated debt repayment plans.For Third-Quarter 2023The company expects third-quarter sales growth from continuing operations of approximately 2% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis.The company expects third-quarter adjusted earnings in aggregate (including discontinued operations) of $0.78 to $0.80 per diluted share and adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share.Second-Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference CallA webcast of Baxter’s second-quarter 2023 conference call for investors can be accessed live from a link on the company’s website at www.baxter.com beginning at 7:30 a.m. CDT on July 27, 2023.

Those non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of special items. For the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, special items for one or more periods included intangible asset amortization, business optimization items, acquisition and integration items, divestiture-related costs, expenses related to European medical devices regulation, product-related items, a pension curtailment gain, non-marketable investment impairments and tax matters. These items are excluded because they are highly variable or unusual and of a size that may substantially impact the company’s reported operations for a period. Additionally, intangible asset amortization is excluded as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance and is consistent with how management and the company’s Board of Directors assess performance.This release and the accompanying tables also include free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure that Baxter defines as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is used by management and the company’s Board of Directors to evaluate the cash generated from Baxter’s operating activities each period after deducting its capital spending.This release also includes forecasts of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as part of the company’s financial outlook for upcoming periods. Non-GAAP financial measures may enhance an understanding of the company’s operations and may facilitate an analysis of those operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the company’s reconciliations to corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures (which are included in the tables accompanying this release), may enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the company’s past financial performance and prospects for the future. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and, in some cases, for purposes of determining incentive compensation. This information should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company’s financial results (including the outlook for third-quarter and full-year 2023) and business development and regulatory activities (including anticipated cost savings). These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the company’s ability to execute and complete strategic initiatives, asset dispositions and other transactions, including the proposed spinoff of the company’s Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories; the company’s plans to simplify the company’s operating model and manufacturing footprint and the pending sale of the company’s BioPharma Solutions product category, the timing for such transactions, the ability to satisfy any applicable conditions and the expected proceeds, consideration and benefits;

the impact of global economic conditions (including, among other things, inflation levels, interest rates, financial market volatility, banking crises, the potential for a recession, the ongoing war in Ukraine, the related economic sanctions being imposed globally in response to the conflict and potential trade wars) and continuing public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or the anticipation of any of the foregoing, on the company’s operations and on the company’s employees, customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the company operates; downgrades to the company’s credit ratings or ratings outlooks, and the related impact on the company’s funding costs and liquidity; product development risks, including satisfactory clinical performance and obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals (including as a result of evolving regulatory requirements), the ability to manufacture at appropriate scale, and the general unpredictability associated with the product development cycle; product quality or patient safety issues leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, warning letters, import bans, sanctions, seizures, litigation, or declining sales, including the focus on evaluating product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines; future actions of (or failures to act or delays in acting by) FDA, the European Medicines Agency or any other regulatory body or government authority (including the SEC, Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services or the Attorney General of any State) that could delay, limit or suspend product development, manufacturing, sale or reimbursement or result in seizures, recalls, injunctions, monetary sanctions or criminal or civil liabilities, including the lifting of the warning letters at the company’s Ahmedabad facility; demand for and market acceptance risks for and competitive pressures related to new and existing products (including challenges with the company’s ability to accurately predict changing consumer preferences and future expenditures, which have led to and may continue to lead to increased inventory levels, and needs and advances in technology and the resulting impact on customer inventory levels), and the impact of those products on quality and patient safety concerns; breaches, including by cyber-attack, data leakage, unauthorized access or theft, or failures of or vulnerabilities in the company’s information technology systems or products; the continuity, availability and pricing of acceptable raw materials and component parts (and the company’s ability to pass some or all of these costs to the company’s customers through recent price increases or otherwise), and the related continuity of the company’s manufacturing and distribution and those of the company’s suppliers; inability to create additional production capacity in a timely manner or the occurrence of other manufacturing, sterilization or supply difficulties (including as a result of natural disaster, public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, regulatory actions or otherwise); the company’s ability to finance and develop new products or enhancements on commercially acceptable terms or at all; loss of key employees, the occurrence of labor disruptions or the inability to identify and recruit new employees; failures with respect to the company’s quality, compliance or ethics programs; future actions of third parties, including third-party payers and the company’s customers and distributors (including group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks), the impact of healthcare reform and its implementation, suspension, repeal, replacement, amendment, modification and other similar actions undertaken by the United States or foreign governments; the outcome of pending or future litigation, including the ethylene oxide or other claims; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; global regulatory, trade and tax policies (including with respect to climate change and other sustainability matters); the ability to protect or enforce the company’s owned or in-licensed patent or other proprietary rights (including trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how) or patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company’s manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; the impact of any goodwill or other intangible asset impairments on the company’s operating results; fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates; any changes in law concerning the taxation of income (whether with respect to current or future tax reform);

These restructuring and other business optimization costs included actions related to its current implementation of a new operating model intended to simplify and streamline its operations, its integration of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. (Hillrom), the decision to cease production of dialyzers at one of its U.S.-based manufacturing facilities later this year, which resulted in a $243 million noncash impairment of property, plant and equipment in the second quarter of 2023, rationalization of certain other manufacturing and distribution facilities and transformation of certain general and administrative functions.3The company’s results in 2023 included $7 million ($5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis) of acquisition and integration-related items. That amount includes $8 million of integration costs, which primarily included third party consulting costs related to its integration of Hillrom, partially offset by a $1 million benefit from changes in the estimated fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. The company’s results in 2022 included $18 million ($14 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis) of acquisition and integration-related items. That amount includes $29 million of integration costs, which primarily included third party consulting costs related to its integration of Hillrom, partially offset by an $11 million benefit from a change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.4The company's results of continuing operations in 2023 included $37 million ($37 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis) of divestiture-related costs. This amount includes costs of external advisors supporting its activities to prepare for the proposed spinoff of its Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories, which are reported in continuing operations. The company's results of discontinued operations in 2023 included $8 million ($8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis) of divestiture-related costs related to the pending sale of its BioPharma Solutions (BPS) product category.5The company’s results in 2023 and 2022 included costs of $12 million ($8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis) and $12 million ($9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share from continuing operations, on an after-tax basis), respectively, of incremental costs to comply with the European Union’s medical device regulations for previously registered products, which primarily consist of contractor costs and other direct third-party costs. The company considers the adoption of these regulations to be a significant one-time regulatory change and believes that the costs of initial compliance for previously registered products over the implementation period are not indicative of its core operating results.6The company's results in 2023 included losses of $20 million ($15 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis) from non-marketable investments in several early stage companies, consisting of $23 million of noncash impairment write-downs, partially offset by a $3 million gain from the sale of an investment.7The company's results in 2022 included a curtailment gain of $11 million ($9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, on an after-tax basis) on an announced change for active non-bargaining participants in our U.S. Hillrom pension plan.8The company's results of continuing operations in 2023 included tax expense items totaling $41 million ($0.08 per diluted share), consisting of a $30 million valuation allowance recorded to reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset for a tax basis step-up related to previously enacted Swiss tax legislation, $4 million of tax costs from divestiture-related activities, and a $7 million reallocation of income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations resulting from the application of intraperiod tax allocation to the company's adjusted results.For more information on the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures, please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this press release.BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC.Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss)(unaudited)(in millions, except per share and percentage data)Six Months Ended June 30,20232022ChangeNET SALES$7,220$7,1521%COST OF SALES4,8344,5197%GROSS MARGIN2,3862,633(9)%% of Net Sales33.0%36.8%(3.8 pts)SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES1,9592,017(3)%% of Net Sales27.1%28.2%(1.1 pts)RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES32929711%% of Net Sales4.6%4.2%0.4 ptsOTHER OPERATING INCOME, NET(14)(28)(50)%OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)112347(68)%% of Net Sales1.6%4.9%(3.3 pts)INTEREST EXPENSE, NET24117439%OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET40(60)NMINCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES(169)233NMINCOME TAX EXPENSE2440(40)%% of Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes(14.2)%17.2%(31.4 pts)INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS(193)193NMINCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX99135(27)%NET INCOME (LOSS)(94)328NMNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS35(40)%NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO BAXTER STOCKHOLDERS$(97)$323NMINCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PER COMMON SHAREBasic$(0.39)$0.37NMDiluted$(0.39)$0.37NMINCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PER COMMON SHAREBasic$0.20$0.27(26)%Diluted$0.20$0.27(26)%NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHAREBasic$(0.19)$0.64NMDiluted$(0.19)$0.64NMWEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDINGBasic506503Diluted506508ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (excluding special items)1$928$1,115(17)%ADJUSTED INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (excluding special items)1$667$990(33)%ADJUSTED INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (excluding special items)1$104$135(23)%ADJUSTED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO BAXTER STOCKHOLDERS (excluding special items)¹$632$914(31)%ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (excluding special items)1$1.04$1.53(32)%ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (excluding special items)1$0.21$0.27(22)%ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS (excluding special items)¹$1.25$1.80(31)%1 Refer to page 13 for a description of the adjustments and a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP measures.NM -

However, as the ultimate timing is uncertain, and to provide comparability to prior guidance, it is providing a financial outlook that also contemplates a scenario in which the transaction does not close in 2023. Under either scenario, BPS is reflected as a discontinued operation, consistent with its presentation throughout these tables and the accompanying release. Adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts referred to below exclude special items.Sales Growth Guidance**Q3 2023FY 2023*Continuing operations sales growth - U.S. GAAP~2%1% - 2%Foreign Exchange~(1)%~0.5%Continuing operations sales growth - Constant currency~1%~2%Adjusted Earnings Per Share Guidance - BPS Remains a Part of Baxter Through Full-Year 2023Q3 2023FY 2023Adjusted diluted EPS - Continuing operations$0.65 - $0.67$2.49 - $2.57Adjusted diluted EPS - Discontinued operations~$0.13~$0.43Adjusted diluted EPS - Total Baxter$0.78 - $0.80$2.92 - $3.00Adjusted Earnings Per Share Guidance - The Pending BPS Sale is Completed on September 30, 2023Q3 2023FY 2023***Adjusted diluted EPS - Continuing operations$0.65 - $0.67$2.54 - $2.62Adjusted diluted EPS - Discontinued operations~$0.13~$0.33Adjusted diluted EPS - Total Baxter$0.78 - $0.80$2.87 - $2.95*Totals may not foot due to rounding**Assuming that BPS were to remain a part of Baxter through year-end 2023, the outlook for sales growth in aggregate (including discontinued operations) would be the same as continuing operations growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. If the pending BPS sale is completed on September 30, 2023, sales growth in the aggregate (including discontinued operations) would be approximately flat to 1% on a reported basis and approximately 1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the absence of BPS sales in the fourth quarter.***If the pending BPS sale is completed on September 30, 2023, the company's outlook for adjusted diluted EPS in the aggregate (including discontinued operations) reflects a $0.10 per share negative impact from the absence of BPS earnings in the fourth quarter. In that scenario, the company's outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share in the aggregate and for continuing operations both reflect a net benefit of approximately $0.05, primarily due to reduced interest expense after giving effect to anticipated debt repayment plans.Baxter calculates forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, forward-looking adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes potential charges or gains that would be reflected as Non-GAAP adjustments to earnings. Baxter provides forward-looking adjusted diluted EPS guidance because it believes that this measure, when viewed with Baxter’s guidance under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. As a result of significant ongoing transformative initiatives including the proposed spin-off of Baxter's Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses, the pending sale of its BPS business, and its implementation of a new operating model, Baxter has not provided reconciliations of forward-looking adjusted EPS guidance to GAAP EPS guidance because the combined impact and timing of potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts (as specified in the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K). In addition, Baxter believes that such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of financial performance.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230725902854/en/ContactsMedia Contact Steve Brett, (224) 948-5353media@baxter.comInvestor Contact Clare Trachtman, (224) 948-3020]"
219,07092eb5-4f4b-3fbf-a45d-2f202af65a3c,WEC,2023-07-27,NiSource (NI) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nisource-ni-earnings-expected-grow-140207960.html,1690380127,STORY,"['NI', 'NIMC', 'WEC']","[NiSource (NI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.16 billion, down 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.76% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NiSource?For NiSource, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NiSource will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NiSource would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NiSource doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, WEC Energy Group (WEC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.17 billion, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for WEC Energy has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WEC Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Johnson &amp; Johnson's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Johnson &amp; Johnson is:18% = US$13b ÷ US$71b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.18 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Johnson &amp; Johnson's Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo begin with, Johnson &amp; Johnson seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 17%. This certainly adds some context to Johnson &amp; Johnson's moderate 12% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing Johnson &amp; Johnson's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 13% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for JNJ? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Johnson &amp; Johnson Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While Johnson &amp; Johnson has a three-year median payout ratio of 61% (which means it retains 39% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Besides, Johnson &amp; Johnson has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 45% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Johnson &amp; Johnson's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 35%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Johnson &amp; Johnson's performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

229,808d5751-f89e-34ed-bd97-92adc7b5fb27,RSG,2023-07-27,Waste Connections (WCN) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-connections-wcn-earnings-expected-140208239.html,1690380128.0,STORY,"['WCN', 'RSG']","[Waste Connections (WCN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis solid waste services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.01 billion, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.41% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waste Connections?For Waste Connections, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Connections will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Waste Connections would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.89, delivering a surprise of +1.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Waste Connections doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, Republic Services (RSG) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +0.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.7 billion, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Republic Services has been revised 0.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Republic Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults. Results from the STRIDE-3 trial demonstrated statistically significant immune responses compared to PCV20 (pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine) in vaccine-naïve adults for serotypes common to both vaccines as assessed by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) 30 days post-vaccination. Positive immune responses were also observed for serotypes unique to V116. Additionally, results from STRIDE-6 demonstrated that V116 was immunogenic for all 21 pneumococcal serotypes in the vaccine among adults who previously received a pneumococcal vaccine at least one year prior to the study. In both studies, V116 had a safety profile comparable to the comparator in the studies. Results will be shared with the scientific community in the near future and will support global regulatory licensure applications.According to pre-pandemic 2019 CDC data, the 21 serotypes covered by V116 are responsible for 85% of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 and older. V116 includes eight serotypes not currently covered by approved pneumococcal vaccines. Serotypes unique to V116 include 15A, 15C, 16F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31 and 35B, which were responsible for approximately 30% of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 and older, based on pre-pandemic 2019 CDC data.Story continues""Despite the availability of current pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, many adults remain vulnerable to pneumococcal disease, especially those who are older,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These results support the potential for V116 to become an important new preventative option for adults, regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status, by expanding coverage to include eight serotypes not currently included in any licensed vaccine. We are very grateful to the patients and investigators who contributed to these studies.""About STRIDE-3STRIDE-3 (NCT05425732) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V116 compared to PCV20 (pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine) in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults (n=2,600). Participants were randomized to receive a single dose of either V116 or PCV20. Primary endpoints included safety, serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) 30 days post-vaccination and percentage of participants with ≥4-fold rise from baseline in serotype-specific OPAs.About STRIDE-6STRIDE-6 (NCT05420961) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V116 in adults 50 years of age or older (n=717) who previously received a pneumococcal vaccination at least one year before enrollment, including PPSV23 (pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent [23-valent]), PCV13 (pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine), PCV15 (pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine) or PCV20 (pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine), PCV13+PPSV23, PCV15+PPSV23 or PPSV23+PCV13. Participants were randomized to receive one dose of either V116, PCV15, or PPSV23. The primary endpoints were safety and geometric mean titer (GMT) of serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) responses 30 days post-vaccination.About V116V116 is an investigational, 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Phase 3 development for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in the adult population. V116 is specifically designed to address the serotypes that represent adult pneumococcal disease, including eight unique serotypes, 15A, 15C, 16F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31 and 35B, which account for approximately 30% of adult disease, according to 2019 pre-pandemic CDC data. V116 has potential to expand disease coverage to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease in more than 85% of individuals 65 and older, based on the same data.Multiple Phase 3 trials of V116 were initiated within the last 12 months, including STRIDE-3 (NCT05425732), STRIDE-6 (NCT05420961), STRIDE-7 (NCT05393037), STRIDE-4 (NCT05464420), STRIDE-5 (NCT05526716), and STRIDE-8 (NCT05696080).About Pneumococcal DiseaseThe global prevalence of pneumococcal disease, an infection caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae, is evolving. There are more than 100 different types of pneumococcal bacteria, which can affect adults differently than children. Highly aggressive strains, or serotypes, threaten to put more people at risk for invasive pneumococcal illnesses such as bacteremia (infection in the bloodstream); bacteremic pneumonia (pneumonia with bacteremia); and meningitis (infection of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord), as well as non-invasive pneumonia (when pneumococcal disease is confined to the lungs). While healthy adults can suffer from pneumococcal disease, patient populations particularly vulnerable to infection include adults 65 years of age and older and those with certain chronic or immunocompromising health conditions.Merck’s Commitment to Pneumococcal Disease ProtectionMerck has been at the forefront of pneumococcal disease prevention through vaccination for more than four decades and remains committed to helping to protect people of all ages from this disease. Merck’s ongoing pneumococcal vaccine development program is designed to provide options to address the specific needs of different populations, including infants and children, healthy adults and at-risk subgroups. This approach recognizes that disease burden in pediatric and adult populations is often driven by different bacterial strains, or serotypes, and aims to address unmet needs by offering vaccine options that target serotypes posing the greatest global risk to each population.

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Countries With Highest Rates of AIDS.AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, remains a pressing global health concern, and its impact varies significantly across nations. In this discussion, we delve into the sobering topic of countries with the highest rates of AIDS. Despite remarkable progress in combating the HIV epidemic, certain regions face alarming prevalence rates, amplifying the urgency of comprehensive prevention, treatment, and awareness efforts. By exploring the current epidemiological landscape, identifying key contributing factors, and evaluating the strategies implemented to address the crisis, we aim to shed light on these countries' challenges and underscore the importance of international collaboration in tackling this devastating disease. Introduction to the AIDS Epidemic: Understanding the Global Impact The AIDS epidemic has significantly impacted the world, affecting millions of people. It first emerged in the 1980s and has since spread to all parts of the world. Despite significant progress in treatment and prevention, it remains a major global health challenge. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 39 million people lived with HIV in 2022, and 630,000 died from AIDS-related illnesses that year. The epidemic's economic impact has also been substantial, with an estimated $7.9 billion spent on AIDS-related healthcare in low- and middle-income countries in 2019. Understanding the epidemic's effects is crucial to developing effective strategies to combat it. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare have all contributed to the spread of the disease. Education and awareness campaigns have played a crucial role in reducing new infections, but much more needs to be done to address the root causes of the epidemic. Ultimately, it is only through a collective effort that we can hope to end the AIDS epidemic and ensure everyone has access to the care and support they need. Story continuesFactors Contributing to High HIV/AIDS Rates: Socioeconomic, Cultural, and Healthcare Factors  High HIV/AIDS rates are a complex issue that can be attributed to various factors such as socioeconomic, cultural, and healthcare factors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), poverty, lack of education, and unemployment are some of the socioeconomic factors that can contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS. In fact, WHO reports that in low- and middle-income countries, people living in poverty are twice as likely to contract HIV/AIDS as those not. Cultural factors such as stigma and discrimination can also contribute to high HIV/AIDS rates. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reports that stigma can prevent individuals from seeking testing, treatment, and care, leading to a higher risk of transmission. Discrimination against certain groups, such as men who have sex with men, sex workers, and people who use drugs, can also contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Healthcare factors such as limited access to testing, treatment, and care can also contribute to high HIV/AIDS rates. According to UNAIDS, lacking knowledge and resources can prevent individuals from accessing the necessary care. Additionally, fear of discrimination from healthcare providers can prevent individuals from seeking care. In fact, UNAIDS reports that globally, only 76% of people living with HIV/AIDS have access to antiretroviral therapy. In order to address the issue of high HIV/AIDS rates, it is essential to address these various factors, which can include increasing access to healthcare, reducing stigma and discrimination, and providing education and resources to prevent the spread of the disease. According to reports, the U.S. government spends $28 billion per year on federal domestic HIV/AIDS programs. By addressing these issues and investing in prevention and treatment programs, we can work towards reducing HIV/AIDS rates and improving the health and well-being of individuals and communities affected by the disease. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and HIV/AIDS: Business Contributions to the Cause Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is crucial for businesses, integrating social and environmental concerns into their operations. One area where companies can significantly impact is combating HIV/AIDS, a global pandemic with devastating consequences. Additionally, businesses can contribute through employee programs, such as education, training, testing, counseling, and support for those living with the disease. By taking action, businesses can play a vital role in the fight against HIV/AIDS and positively impact affected individuals and communities. Innovation in HIV/AIDS Research: Advancements and Challenges  Innovation in HIV/AIDS research has come a long way since the epidemic's early days. According to recent financial statistics, the global market for HIV/AIDS drugs was valued at $30.46 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $45.58 billion by 2028, which is a testament to the significant advancements that have been made in treating this disease. Advancements in the treatment of AIDS have indeed come a long way in recent years, thanks to the tireless efforts of several breakthrough companies and the development of new medications. These companies have invested significantly in research and development, which has led to the discovery of powerful tools in the fight against AIDS.For instance, Truvada, a breakthrough medication that is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Gilead Science, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), one of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the world, has generated over $19.5 billion in revenue on Truvada since its approval in 2012.Speaking of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) the company has developed a number of medications that have revolutionized AIDS treatment. In 2022 alone, Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) and ViiV Healthcare are also making significant contributions to AIDS treatment. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)'s Delstrigo and ViiV Healthcare's Cabenuva have turned out to be affective HIV medications. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and ViiV Healthcare play an important role in AIDS treatment.20 Countries With Highest Rates Of AIDSJarun Ontakrai/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology For our list of the countries with the highest rates of AIDS, we relied on aggregated data by Statista and World Population Review and ranked the countries in ascending order of high rate of AIDS among populations aged 15-49 as of 2021.Here is the list of the 20 countries with the highest rate of AIDS.20. Cote Dlvoire AIDS Rate: 1.9% AIDS is a significant issue in Cote D'Ivoire, with an estimated 1.9% prevalence among adults aged 15-49, higher than the sub-Saharan Africa average. The disease's impact on daily life includes various health problems and management difficulties. Economically, AIDS leads to lost productivity and increased healthcare costs. Nevertheless, efforts to improve HIV testing and treatment access offer hope for reducing the disease's impact over time. 19. South Sudan  AIDS Rate: 2.1% AIDS is a significant health concern in South Sudan, with approximately 170,000 people affected. The disease substantially impacts daily life, making work and family care challenging due to physical and emotional symptoms. High treatment costs lead to limited access, worsening symptoms, and overall health. The economic toll is considerable, with AIDS resulting in lost productivity and increased healthcare expenses. The government and international organizations focus on improving access to affordable treatment, prevention measures, and education to combat the issue. 18. Rwanda AIDS Rate: 2.3% In Rwanda, AIDS is a severe issue, impacting over a quarter million people. The disease's cost is high, despite government programs for awareness, prevention, and treatment. Many living with HIV/AIDS can't work, resulting in lost income and reduced productivity. However, Rwanda is progressing in the fight against AIDS with continued efforts and support. 17. Central African Republic AIDS Rate: 2.7% In the Central African Republic, the AIDS epidemic is a significant concern, with around 120,000 people living with HIV. The disease's impact is profound, leading to ostracization, limited healthcare access, and economic discrimination. Treating AIDS turn out to be very costly, straining the country's limited resources and struggling economy. Collaborative efforts between the government and international organizations are crucial to increase prevention and treatment access, reduce stigma, and support those affected, working towards ending the AIDS epidemic. 16. Cameroon AIDS Rate: 2.9% AIDS affects thousands of people in Cameroon, especially marginalized groups like sex workers and homosexual males. Social stigma and discrimination hinder healthcare access for those living with AIDS. The disease places a heavy economic burden on the healthcare system due to high treatment costs. The government has addressed the crisis by improving healthcare access and reducing stigma. However, more support is needed to combat the disease's spread. In 2022 Cameroon had 480,000 people living with AIDS, with 35,000 new infections.  15. Gabon  AIDS Rate: 3% Just like other countries, Gabon also stands among the countries with the highest rate of AIDS, with around 25,000 people living with the disease, particularly among sex workers and gays. The disease's impact includes stigma, discrimination, and severe health consequences. Economically, treating AIDS strains the country's resources, posing challenges for affordability. 14. Guinea – Bissau AIDS Rate: 3.1% AIDS affects about 3.1% of Guinea - Bissau's population aged 15-49. Daily life for those with AIDS is impacted by discrimination and high treatment costs. The disease also poses significant economic consequences, with decreased productivity and increased healthcare expenses. However, the government and NGOs are actively working on prevention and treatment programs to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS and support those affected. 13. Equatorial Guinea AIDS Rate: 3.3% AIDS affects around 63,000 people in Equatorial Guinea. The disease takes a toll on their daily life physically and emotionally. Efforts are underway to combat HIV/AIDS, including awareness campaigns and treatment access programs. However, there is still much to be done in the fight against this devastating disease. 12. Congo AIDS Rate: 3.8% Congo is another one of the countries with highest rates of HIV Infections, with over 1.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS, representing a prevalence rate of around 3.8%. The disease profoundly impacts daily life, making work and activities challenging due to health complications and facing discrimination. Economically, AIDS costs the country billions of dollars annually, with high treatment expenses and lost productivity. Treating AIDS is a significant challenge, with antiretroviral drugs often being prohibitively expensive for many, despite efforts by the government and international organizations to provide access. 11. Kenya AIDS Rate: 4% AIDS is a significant health concern in Kenya, affecting approximately 1.5 million people. Due to stigma, the disease takes a toll on their daily lives, with physical, emotional, and social challenges. Economically, treating AIDS costs up to $20 per person per month, which makes it $224 annually, straining the healthcare system and budget. However, education, awareness campaigns, and increased testing and treatment access are making a positive difference in combatting the spread of AIDS in Kenya. 10. Tanzania AIDS Rate: 4.5% Tanzania has around 1.7 million people living with AIDS. The disease's impact is immense, leading to discrimination, health complications, and limited access to healthcare. Economically, AIDS results in high treatment costs, lost productivity, and reduced economic growth. While some programs offer free or low-cost antiretroviral therapy, treatment expenses remain a significant burden, especially for remote areas with limited healthcare services. 9. Uganda AIDS Rate: 5.2% AIDS is a severe health issue in Uganda, affecting about 1.4 million people with widespread discrimination and stigma. Economically, treating the disease is burdensome, costing approximately $258.78 per person, straining the healthcare system. However, efforts are underway to combat HIV/AIDS, including improved testing and treatment access and awareness campaigns to reduce stigma. 8. Malawi AIDS Rate: 7.7% AIDS is a significant health concern in Malawi, with an estimated 1.1 million people living with the disease. This high prevalence substantially impacts the daily lives of those affected, as they often face stigma and discrimination. It also significantly impacts the country's economy, as the cost of treating AIDS can be very high. In Malawi, it is estimated that the cost of treating AIDS is around $330 per person per year. Despite these challenges, efforts are underway to combat the spread of AIDS in Malawi, including increased education and access to testing and treatment. 7. Zambia AIDS Rate: 10.8% In Zambia, around 53,000 people are affected by AIDS. Daily life for those with the disease involves managing symptoms and adhering to strict medication regimes. Economically, treating AIDS costs approximately $200 million annually, straining the country's limited resources and hindering other development areas. Socially, AIDS leads to stigma and discrimination, impacting mental health and well-being. Addressing these challenges is vital to create a more inclusive and supportive society in Zambia. 6. Zimbabwe  AIDS Rate: 11.6% Zimbabwe stands sixth among the countries with the highest rates of AIDS, with approximately 1.3 million people fighting with the disease. Stigma and discrimination make accessing healthcare and employment difficult for those living with the disease, impacting their daily lives and financial stability. Caring for a bedridden AIDS patient in the country for three months costs approximately $556-841 for the family. However, with access to antiretroviral therapy and support services, many individuals can manage the disease and lead productive lives. Addressing the root causes of the AIDS epidemic remains essential to ensure widespread access to care and support in Zimbabwe. Click to see and continue reading the 5 Countries With Highest Rates of AIDS.Suggested Article:20 Countries with the Highest Rates of Skin Cancer.25 Countries With Highest Rates of Obesity.20 Countries With The Highest Rate Of Diabetes.Disclosure.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 4.48%.Factors to ConsiderStrong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine, Gardasil, is likely to have boosted sales growth in the second quarter like several previous quarters.In oncology drugs, Keytruda sales are likely to have been driven by continued strong momentum in metastatic indications and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Keytruda’s sales is $5.87 billion, while our estimate is $5.69 billion. However, Keytruda’s year-over-year growth rate in the United States is expected to have moderated in the second quarter as the impact of the strong initial uptake of earlier-stage indications softened. In outside U.S. markets, while volumes are expected to have remained strong, pricing is expected to have been a headwind.Higher alliance revenues from Lynparza, driven by increased demand, may have boosted oncology sales. Please note that Merck markets Lynparza in partnership with AstraZeneca AZN.AstraZeneca and Merck formed a profit-sharing deal to co-market Lynparza and Koselugo in July 2017.AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indications.Alliance revenues from Lenvima may have also boosted oncology sales.In the hospital specialty portfolio, higher demand and an increase in market share may have benefited sales of neuromuscular blockade medicine — Bridion injection. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bridion is $425 million, while our estimate is $372.6 million.With regard to the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, ex-U.S. sales are expected to have been driven by strong demand in international markets like China in the second quarter. In the United States, sales were flat in the first quarter. It remains to be seen if sales trends improved in the second quarter. Overall, though Gardasil revenue growth in 2023 is expected to be higher than 2022 levels, the rate of growth in the second quarter is expected to have been less than the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gardasil is $1.99 billion.Story continuesMeanwhile, the top line is expected to have witnessed the impact of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for drugs like Remicade, Noxafil and Zetia. Lower demand and pricing in the United States and generic competition in certain international markets may have hurt sales of the diabetes franchise (Januvia/Janumet).  The drugs lost market exclusivity in China in July and the European Union in September last year.Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’ oral antiviral pill to treat COVID-19, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) is unlikely to have been a major contributor to top-line growth in the second quarter. Lagevrio sales are likely to have primarily come from international markets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lagevriois $155 million, while our estimate is $220.7 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our estimate for Merck’s Pharmaceutical unit is$11.88 billion.The Animal Health franchise’s sales growth is likely to have contributed to top-line growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Animal Health unit is $1.55 billion, while our estimate is $1.63 billion.Earnings Surprise HistoryThis large drugmaker beat earnings expectations in each of the trailing four quarters.

233,d0f891eb-165c-3774-8537-80e5acb98a3a,MOS,2023-07-27,Analysts Estimate CF Industries (CF) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-cf-industries-cf-140234202.html,1690380154,STORY,"['CF', 'MOS']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when CF Industries (CF) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -64.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.86 billion, down 45.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.59% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF?For CF, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CF will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CF would post earnings of $2.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.85, delivering a surprise of +8.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CF doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Fertilizers industry, Mosaic (MOS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.13 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -69%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.22 billion, down 40.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Mosaic has been revised 14.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -6.84%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mosaic will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence And The Stock MarketThe stock market has been through a lot in the past few years, what with geopolitical tensions, interest rates and inflation, and a pandemic to boot, all being fast on its tail. Despite these significant challenges, the markets have managed to bounce back in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 having risen by 1.47 points or 0.032%, the Nasdaq Composite rising by 27.49 points or 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average being up by 2.51 points or 0.007%, all on July 24. The success of the markets has largely been based on a larger narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), specifically generative AI and other similar technology. Considering the wide-ranging impact of AI on the markets, investors and finance-minded individuals, in general, are looking at this technology as a way to make the most money they can while they still have the chance.On July 10, CNBC quoted Matt Higgins, a self-made millionaire and the CEO of investment firm RSE Ventures, as commenting that ""AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history."" According to Higgins, this technology has no regard for an individual's background or anything else, giving the global public a chance to try their own hand at making money without any barriers holding them back. Higgins is also not the only person to believe in AI as a money-making technology, as people all across the world are becoming engaged in things like freelancing and entrepreneurship with the help of AI today. At the same time, investors are considering this technology as the turning point in the business journeys of many companies. AI is presenting all sorts of possibilities to a variety of companies today, allowing them to innovate and come up with different products and services that can get them back in demand with consumers and investors alike. This is why many stocks that have remained under the radar for investors for a long time are now beginning to make a name for themselves again.Story continuesHow Are Overlooked Stocks Playing The AI Boom?Many companies, like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), have been using AI to their advantage. These moves have started to garner support for these companies in light of their stellar financial profiles and their efforts to play the AI boom in their favor. Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), for instance, has been using AI to track plants across different weather, soil types, and sun exposure to see the impact of these different conditions on plants for its agricultural operations. The company's latest earnings report from the second quarter also showed that it beat EPS estimates by $1.18 with its $9.65 EPS, while its revenue of $16.08 billion also beat estimates by $1.21 billion. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) has a similar story with a $9.38 EPS in the first quarter beating estimates by $0.18, and revenues of $26.74 billion, also beating estimates by $344.84 million, while the company is also engaged in AI operations.Stocks like these have solid profiles, and their recent ventures in the AI space are making professionals consider them to be some of the best under-the-radar stocks to buy if you're looking to pick up stocks that can play the AI boom. Considering the immense growth potential companies like these seem to have, they may even be considered to be some of the best undervalued stocks to buy now or some of the top undervalued stocks in the S&amp;P 500 overall. Keeping this in mind, we have compiled a list of 11 such stocks below.11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe first picked 25 stocks named by other sources online as some of the top under-the-radar stocks on the market today. We then shortlisted 11 stocks from this list by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, based on which stocks had the most hedge fund investors.

In the coming years, we expect the company to benefit from an acceleration in US manufacturing investment to support customers’ nearshoring initiatives and in response to federal government incentive programs to manufacture energy transition products domestically. In addition, we expect Rockwell to experience revenue and margin tailwinds in 2023 from easing supply chain constraints, which limited its ability to meet customer demand in 2022.”Like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is an overlooked stock that is popular among hedge funds this year.9. Equinix, Inc.

(NASDAQ:IBKR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Orbis Investment Management was the most prominent shareholder in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:IBKR) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also modestly added to our position in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in the mid-$70s. We initiated our Interactive Brokers position last summer and published a write-up in September 2022. Interactive Brokers continues to trade at a discounted multiple as investors are skeptical that the company will continue to sustain the current level of net interest income beyond the near future. However, recent reports showing strength in the US economy and labor market suggest that interest rates won’t be cut in the near term. The company publishes monthly KPI metrics and investors appear to be ignoring recent strength in trading volume and margin loans. The current market environment of rising stock prices and elevated interest rates is a goldilocks environment for the company. With this last buy, we have now reached our limit of investing 10% of our portfolio at cost in the stock and can no longer increase the holding size.”7. LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is another investment banking and brokerage company on our list. It is based in San Diego, California.

(NASDAQ:LPLA) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is the largest independent broker-dealer in the U.S. Following a strong run in 2022, the stock detracted in the quarter. The weakness was largely driven by turmoil in the banking industry after the failure of SVB, which caused investors to sour on financial stocks in general. We believe LPL is immune from most of the issues facing banks. LPL is not a bank itself, has a relatively small balance sheet, and has a low-risk, short-duration securities portfolio. The banking crisis has caused investors to take a more dovish view on the path of interest rates, which is a headwind to LPL’s earnings as the economics on a large portion of client cash is tied to floating rates.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter HDD revenues is pegged at $1.397 billion.

The video above explains how it's done.Pagès Group, a gold-level member of Rockwell's PartnerNetwork™, provides automaton solutions for the packaging industry. The France-based company is an industry innovator known for pioneering In-Mold Labeling technology, an injection-mold process used for plastic packaging.With an increase in sustainability requirements and consumer demand, Pagès customers wanted more sustainable packaging. New packaging materials require new solutions to accommodate high-volume line speeds, varying package sizes, and label adhesion regardless of fiber type and surface.Using Rockwell technology-including drives, integrated robotic control, and Independent Cart Technology (ICT)-Pagès Group created Molded Fiber Labeling™ (MFL) to create molded fiber packaging material made with a mix of wood and water that's 100% compostable and recyclable. The paper labels are glue-free and can be affixed to complex shapes or rough surfaces on various package sizes.Rockwell helps machine and equipment builders like Pagès Group meet their customers' flexibility and performance requirements with advanced technologies and services that drive smart, integrated manufacturing.""We listened to our customers to see how we could help them transition from plastic to something more sustainable,"" said Yann Palanchon, vice president, North America &amp; Global Services, Pagès Group.

ROK is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 1, before the opening bell.Q2 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues improved year over year. The top and bottom lines also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in the last trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.3%.Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Rockwell Automation, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Rockwell Automation, Inc. QuoteQ3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.3 billion, indicating an improvement of 16.7% from the prior-year quarter’s actual. The same for earnings is pinned at $3.18 per share, implying a 19.6% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The company’s earnings estimates have moved down 1.5% in the past 30 days.Factors to NoteIn the past few quarters, Rockwell Automation has witnessed an improvement in order levels. Low order cancellation rates indicate solid underlying demand from customers across many industries and regions.  Ongoing capital investments in several end markets, coupled with higher automation and digital transformation, are expected to have supported solid order levels across all segments in the quarter under review. Our model predicts an organic sales growth of 10.5% for the quarter.ROK’s performance has been impacted by ongoing material shortages and production delays in the earlier quarters. However, supply-chain issues have shown signs of easing lately. This is expected to have aided the company’s fiscal third-quarter performance.Higher logistics costs due to elevated energy expenses and constrained air freight lanes are likely to have impacted margins. We expect selling, general &amp; administrative expenses to increase 12.6% year over year in the quarter.Higher sequential spending on product development, resiliency and the company’s annual merit increase timing are expected to have weighed on ROK’s margin performance. Nonetheless, the company’s price increase actions are likely to have mitigated the impacts of inflationary pressures and contributed to margin expansion.Story continuesSegmental ExpectationsWe expect the Intelligent Devices segment’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues to be up 13.5% year over year to $996 million. Our prediction for the segment’s operating profit is pinned at $211 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 21.6%.Our model predicts the Software &amp; Control segment’s sales at $691 million, suggesting an increase of 13.9% from the prior year’s actuals. The same for the segment’s operating profit is pinned at $202 million, indicating an increase of 21.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.We expect the Lifecycle Services segment’s sales to be $515 million, indicating growth of 6.6% from the prior-year period’s actual. The same for the segment’s operating profit is pinned at $32 million, indicating a fall of 28.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.What the Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Rockwell Automation this time around.

238,95cb0fd2-168e-3d54-ae89-5f79e35a53c6,WMB,2023-07-27,"Earnings Preview: Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-williams-companies-inc-140240215.html,1690380160,STORY,['WMB'],"[Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pipeline operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.77 billion, up 11.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Williams Companies, Inc. (The)?For Williams Companies, Inc. (The), the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Williams Companies, Inc. (The) will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Williams Companies, Inc. (The) would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.56, delivering a surprise of +21.74%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Mr. Welch, please go ahead.Matt WelchThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information included in today's press release.

In addition, we refer you to our earnings release for presentation -- and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.Story continuesDavid L. CalhounThank you, Matt. Welcome, everyone. As usual, I'm going to make a few comments upfront with respect to the quarter. The quarter was solid, very solid for all of our businesses. We continue to make steady progress on our recovery.We do have challenges. The supply chain notably is the most significant, but it's steadily getting better. Overall, we feel good about our operational and financial outlook, including the free cash flow and delivery ranges that we set for 2023 as well as for that 2025 and '26 time frame.We're particularly encouraged by generating $2.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow is the best metric that we have to measure progress against this recovery. We had a very strong second quarter, and we're confident in the $3 billion to $5 billion target for the year.I'd like to highlight a couple of updates around the businesses. Commercial Airplanes had a very solid quarter. Demand remains high. We booked 460 net orders in the second quarter. And we're proud to announce or firm up key orders, I should say, 220 for Air India, and we secured our commitment for up to 300 with Ryanair.Broadly, demand is strong and resilient. The need for 42,000 airplanes over the next 20 years is what the industry is telling us. And with demand strong, the supply side of the system is beginning to settle down. Our focus remains on execution and driving stability in the production and the supply chain, and we're making steady progress.We delivered 136 commercial airplanes in the quarter, including 103 737s and 20 787. Given the progress through the first half of the year, we are on the right path to reach our 737 and 787 delivery guidance for the year. And we're steadily increasing our rates on each program with focus on stability every step of the way.With respect to the Spirit quality escapes, the work stoppage and the bridge impairment, all have been contained and will be remedied as we exit the third quarter. But it will cost us a few deliveries in the quarter itself.We're also progressing across our key development programs: the 737-7, the -10, the 777X and the 777-8F. This quarter is a solid proof point that we're beginning to stabilize our operations and are on the right path, and the financial results speak for themselves.I'd like to recognize our team and our customers on the 737 MAX return to service. As of this month, the fleet has flown more than 5 million flight hours and over 2 million flights since returning to service, all with exceptional reliability.The return to service in China is now largely complete as well with more than 90% of the 737 MAX aircraft back in service. More broadly, in China, we're encouraged by recent signs of progress. It's an important market for us. We're committed to our customers there, and we'll be ready to deliver when that time comes.Boeing defense. In defense and space, we still have more work to improve operating performance, but the portfolio is well positioned, and we're making progress. Results impacted by continuing losses on 3 fixed-price development programs, Commercial Crew, the T-7A and the MQ-25, have hit us in the quarter.On Starliner, we're in lockstep with our customer. We prioritize safety, and we're taking whatever time is required. We're confident in that team and committed to getting it right.On MQ-25, schedule pressure added cost to the program, but we've had some recent successes that give us confidence that we're heading in the right direction. We're approximately 25% of the way through the build of our first MQ-25. The static test article fuselage is complete with preparation underway for the start of static testing this quarter.And on the T-7A, the impact was not due to any performance challenge within the quarter and was more associated with our estimates for higher supply chain and production costs in the future, similar to what many in the industry are facing. Even with the cost growth, we're hitting some key milestones on the program.The Air Force successfully completed its first flight of the T-7. We're heading towards the start of a flight test in earnest. We're looking at the program. And if you look at the program from award to this moment, we've had some very important successes. We moved from firm concept to early flight testing in just 36 months on this program. And a combination of model-based engineering, 3D design and our advanced manufacturing increased first-time quality by 75% and reduced our assembly hours by 80%.We're also making progress on other key BDS programs. On the tanker, for example, we have now completed rework on the production aircraft acquiring it, and we have resumed deliveries to the Air Force. As we move through each quarter, we're progressing through these contracts and getting closer to putting them in the rearview mirror.Despite the challenges, we're hitting some important milestones that increase our confidence. Most importantly, these programs will meet or beat the high-performance standards of the warfighter.Given the fixed price nature of some of our contracts, we're very transparent about these financial impacts. And we're working to stabilize, to derisk and mature them through development.Quarterly charges have declined significantly over the last 18 months. The demand side of BDS is strong. We see solid order activity. In the quarter, we booked orders valued at $6 billion, including key contracts from the U.S. Army for 19 Chinooks, and Germany also shared its plans to purchase 60 Chinooks.We remain confident in our defense business. Demand is strong, and we will continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels.Boeing Global Services. Another very strong quarter both on the commercial and government side of BGS, healthy revenue and expanding earnings and margin. We're really proud of this team. They've had solid, steady performance. And they've enabled both commercial and military customers to keep fleets flying through a very dynamic time.Some of our highlights this quarter include the expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, Japan Airlines adopting Boeing Insight Accelerator, our digital predictive maintenance solution for the 787 fleet.To wrap up my comments, we've had no shortage of challenges pop up to the start of this year, and we knew that would be the case. We've had conformance items that we've identified or external challenges within the supply chain, even logistic routes, including washed out bridges.This is a complex business. We expect items to come up. And when they do, we're transparent. We take action, and we move forward. This is what progress looks like. We're proud of the team. We are well positioned for the year and for the long term. Relative to the strong demand, we will remain in a supply-constrained world for the foreseeable future.And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.Brian J. WestThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance. Second quarter revenue was $19.8 billion. That's up 18% year-over-year. The growth was primarily driven by higher commercial volume, including increased 787 deliveries.Core operating margin in the quarter was minus 2%, and the core loss per share was $0.82. Margins and EPS were driven by expected abnormal costs and period expenses as well as losses on 3 fixed-price development programs in our defense business, which I'll cover later.Free cash flow, as Dave mentioned, was positive $2.6 billion in the quarter, significantly better versus last year and last quarter driven by higher commercial deliveries and favorable receipt timing. Relative to our expectations shared at the last earnings call, the strong order activity in the quarter drove over $2 billion of favorable advanced payment timing. Keep in mind, most of this was expected to incur in the third quarter.Turning to the next page, I'll cover Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 460 net orders in the quarter, including 220 with Air India, 39 with Riyadh Air and signed a purchase agreement with Ryanair for up to 300 737 MAX 10s. We now have over 4,800 airplanes in backlog valued at $363 billion.Revenue was $8.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year on 136 airplane deliveries driven by the 87 program. Operating margin was minus 4.3%, a sequential improvement versus the first quarter as anticipated but remains negative as we continue to be impacted by expected abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&amp;D spending. As Dave noted, we worked through a number of operational challenges so far this year. We're making steady progress, and we'll continue to focus on stability as we look to increase production on key programs.On the Spirit work stoppage, we were pleased to see a quick resolution, and we will work through any limited impacts to production. Overall, this is not expected to change our production and delivery outlook.On to the programs. On the 737, we had 103 deliveries in the quarter, including 49 in June, a positive proof point that the production system is stabilizing. In regards to the Spirit fitting issue that we discussed last quarter, in May, we resumed deliveries of rework airplanes and also began producing newly built airplanes meeting our specifications.In light of this progress, we are now transitioning production to 38 per month and still plan to increase to 50 per month in the '25, '26 time frame. As we move to the higher rate, we'll continue to prioritize stability, and it will take some time to consistently deliver at 38 per month off the line. We still project full year 737 deliveries of 400 to 450 with sequential improvement in the second half.We ended the quarter with approximately 228 MAX airplanes in inventory. This includes 85 for customers in China and 55 that have now been remarketed as part of the plan we've previously discussed. We still expect most MAX inventory airplane to be delivered by the end of 2024.Moving on to the 87 program. We had 20 deliveries in the quarter and still expect between 70 and 80 deliveries this year. We increased production to 4 per month during the quarter and still plan to reach 5 per month by year-end. We ended the quarter with 85 airplanes in inventory, and rework is progressing nicely. And we still expect most to be delivered by the end of 2024.We booked $314 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations. And there's no change to the total estimate of $2.8 billion, which is largely done by year-end.Finally, on the 777X program, efforts are ongoing, and the program time line is unchanged. Abnormal costs were $136 million as expected, and we've lowered our total estimate from $1.5 billion to $1 billion, which reflects plans to resume production later this year rather than early 2024.Moving on to the next page and defense and space. BDS booked $6 billion in orders in the quarter, including an award from the U.S. Army for 19 CH-47 Chinooks, and the backlog is now at $58 billion. Revenue was flat at $6.2 billion, and we delivered 38 aircraft in the quarter.Operating margin was minus 8.5% primarily driven by 3 fixed price development programs. The first was related to Commercial Crew tied to schedule delays that we've previously shared and had a $257 million impact; the second on MQ-25 related to a schedule shift that drove a $68 million impact; and lastly, on the T-7A production contract, we revised the long-term production cost estimates that will occur over several years starting in the 2025 time frame, which drove an impact of $189 million.These determinations were mostly made over the last few weeks as we closed out the quarter. Similar to last quarter, roughly 60% of the portfolio is generating solid levels of performance, in line with historical margins. But we continue to see operational impacts from labor instability and supply chain disruption on other programs that contributed to lower margins.Looking at BDS in aggregate, it will take time to return to normalized levels of performance. We're confident and we're focused on the path to high single-digit margins in 2025, 2026. There's strong demand across the customer base, the portfolio is well positioned, and we're focused on execution.Moving on to the next page, let's cover services. BGS had another very strong quarter. BGS received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog is $18 billion. Revenue was $4.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year primarily driven by favorable volume and mix in both commercial and government services.Operating margin was 18%, an expansion of 110 basis points versus last year with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins. Operating margins in the quarter were higher than expected due to favorable mix, which we don't expect to continue at these levels.In the quarter, BGS announced an expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, a collaboration with CAE. And the Japan Airlines has adopted the Boeing Insight Accelerator for their 787 fleet.Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of cash and marketable securities. And our debt balance decreased to $52.3 billion. In the quarter, we repaid $3.4 billion of maturing debt and provided a $180 million cash advance to Spirit as previously shared.Year-to-date, we've repaid $5.1 billion of debt, which is essentially all of our maturities for the year. We also maintained $12 billion revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, all of which remain undrawn.Our liquidity position is strong. Investment-grade credit rating continues to be important. And we're deploying capital in line with the priorities we've shared: invest in the business and pay down debt through strong cash flow generation.And flipping to the last page, I'll cover our outlook. The 2023 overall financial outlook is unchanged from what we previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation. The operating cash makeup by division will likely be different with BCA and BGS better than expected and BDS lower than expected due to the lower operating performance. Net-net, we still have confidence in the $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow for the year.Stepping back to address the state of the market. Commercial demand remains strong across our key programs and services. Cargo remains healthy. Global passenger traffic was up 39% in May and is at 96% of prepandemic levels, 105% domestic and 91% international.China pass-through traffic in May was at 87% of prepandemic levels with domestic traffic up more than 300% year-on-year and above prepandemic levels. Defense demand is also robust, and the FY '24 budget continues to progress in line with our expectations.Our portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and of our allies. With demand strong, we still find ourselves in a supply-constrained environment. And our focus continues to be on execution, both within our factories and the supply chain, as we steadily increase production.Relative to the first half of 2023, we continue to expect operating and financial performance to improve in the second half. On the third quarter specifically, we expect BCA margins to improve sequentially but remain negative, and we're not anticipating much in terms of BDS profitability.The 2Q effective tax rate of 63% included cumulative adjustments related to the projected valuation allowance. These adjustments will continue to weigh on the tax rate for the remainder of the year. And given the strong results in 2Q cash flow, 3Q will be lower sequentially, still positive and likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars.All things considered, we feel good about where we're at on the road to recovery. Right now, we're squarely focused on meaningful operating performance improvement, including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow, all of which will improve as we progress through 2023.And while the challenges remain, we're headed in the right direction. Ultimately, we expect our operational and financial performance to continue to accelerate, aligned with the plan we laid out at our IR Day last November. And we are confident in $10 billion of free cash flow in 2025, 2026.With that, I'll turn it over to Dave with some final remarks.David L. CalhounAgain, a solid quarter. We are wrestling our way through the BDS contract -- fixed-price contract exposures that we have. We're confident we will see them through. And as I've said before, most importantly, the products that we deliver to a warfighter will perform as or better than expected.So with that, I'll open it up to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluSo just digging into Commercial Airplanes' operating loss of $383 million in the quarter, how do we think about this turning positive? Can you maybe talk about the biggest drivers thinking about production rates stabilizing and then going up, what that does to operating margins? And how do you think about finalizing abnormal cost concessions and just pricing playing into the mix?Brian J. WestSheila, I'll start off with that. Last quarter -- first quarter, I should say, BCA margins were negative 9%, and we knew that they were going to get sequentially better, and they did. They got down to negative 4%. So it's good progress.In terms of where we're headed, as we think about the back half of the year, we will still have some negativity, although sequentially better in the third quarter. And then as we exit the year and moving over into the first quarter of next year, those margins will move positive. We're confident in that.And some of the things are the ones you mentioned, which is rate ramp. You'll have some of this abnormal behind us in the rearview mirror and will be done. And of course, the pricing environment is pretty good. So all of that give us confidence that we will get these margins positive. And it will likely be towards the end of the year, early next year. And the team is laser-like focused on meeting those expectations.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.Peter J. ArmentBrian, staying on that same line of questioning on MAX profitability. Maybe you can just walk us through how we think about cash profitability will improve with these scheduled rate breaks. Do we need to hit like a higher rate of 42 a month before we see meaningful improvement there? Or is it more about the -- once the liquidations are complete in 2024?Brian J. WestWell, it's both. Certainly, the liquidation benefit is something we're very focused on because when you get rid of both on the 37 and the 87 those dual factories, it's just going to be a huge relief for the business to put that behind us. And we're tracking, and we're going to make good progress. And that will be substantially behind us as we move out of 2024. So that, no doubt, is a very big deal, coupled with the rate breaks.We just announced going to 38. That's a big important move, and there'll be subsequent rate breaks beyond that. And all of that is going to play into a margin trajectory that's going to start to look a lot more normal. And by the time we get through 2024, and we're focused on that '25, '26 time frame, as we've said, BCA margins will look a lot like they did before in that low double-digit area. So we know what we have to go do. The levers are clear. We just got to execute.OperatorThe next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonOne clarification, one question. So I think, Brian, you said that you expected second half improvement in 37 deliveries. So are you implying that we're now going to be at the top end of the delivery range for the 737? And then I was intrigued by the 777X pull forward of resuming production there. Dave, was there something on the regulatory front in terms of progress that's helping you pull forward that schedule at this point?David L. CalhounNo, I wouldn't say anything has changed. We're still confident in the regulatory process. This is our desire to simply get ahead of the production curve. There's no -- yes, no breaks on the regulatory side. We still have margin in that. And hopefully, we can beat it. But all the projections we've given you, I think, are still intact.Brian J. WestMyles, in answer to the 737 forecast that we get to the high end, we -- of course, we did 103 in the second quarter, and the quarterly rates will be higher than 103 is our expectation. Of course, we had a little bit of the Spirit impact in there. That's why that will get sequentially better.And in terms of the rate itself, we squarely see the middle of that range as high confidence. And the question is going to be how much can we move from the middle of the range up to the higher end. And we'll prove that out day in and day out as we execute and build more airplanes. So we feel very good about the range, and we'll keep reporting as we see the execution, but right now, a degree of confidence in that front.OperatorThe next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi.Jason Michael GurskyBrian, one just bookkeeping question and then one question on defense margins. On the more bookkeeping one, the services business is posting some pretty good margins here, and you're noting mix. I'm just wondering when you -- if you could just talk a little bit about when you kind of go back to more normalized margins in that business based on what you're seeing in your inventory mix there.And then on the defense, you've historically talked about 60% doing pretty well, 15% these development programs and then 25% some legacy programs. That's how you've talked about the margins in that business. Can you confirm that 60%, 15%, 25% is still the right mix of things? And then kind of what's based -- or what's in your assumptions on getting back to that high single-digit rate in that '25, '26 time frame in those 3 buckets?Brian J. WestSure. So let's take services. Yes, they just had an excellent quarter. And both the commercial and the government businesses were performing incredibly well. We still have expectations of that business, and we want them to be doing margins that are in the teens. Will it be 18 quarter-on-quarter out? No, it will come back a little bit. But when I say come back a little bit, we still feel like our long-term view of that business should be in the mid-teens.And from time to time, it will be a little better, and we'll keep pushing the business to be just as good as they can be. But I don't expect it to step back dramatically. We feel really good about where that business is positioned.David L. CalhounI'd just comment on that. It's just important to note that they are still in an extremely supply-constrained world. Everything they do is supply constrained. So pricing is a little favorable. Anything that they can get out of their shops are being taken.That has not changed. And so how long that lasts? My prediction is it's going to be quite a while. I don't see any let up with respect to the need for lift out there, and everybody is fighting for the next part. So I think that's just the moment we're in.Brian J. WestAnd in regards to the defense business, you've got the pieces correct. The way we think about the fixed-price development programs that we've talked about, 15%, we just have to stabilize those and execute and know that every quarter, we're getting closer to having those products over and delivering behind us.The next piece of the 60%, very stable. There's a lot of very nice products in there, and we have to keep them stable. And with lean efforts and other things, we actually could get a little bit of productivity out of those programs to get better and better and better. But that's -- keep that 60% stable and keep it moving.And it's the 25% that's left over, that's the part of the portfolio, it's a handful of programs, and they are not where they need to be. They are negative. They need to swing positive, and there's a plan to go do that, but it's just going to take us a little bit of time.In terms of what this portfolio looks like in the '25, '26 time frame, we believe the 15% will be stable, right? We'll be at certain milestones where a lot of the stuff will be in the rearview mirror.And the 85% that's left over is going to be performing at very attractive margins because we've done the hard work of stabilizing and then trying to bring in even more productivity programs, including lean manufacturing, so that these businesses can get even healthier and stronger. So the road map is clear. It's on us to execute it, but we think we've got all the levers working. And the team is very motivated and laser-like focused.OperatorThe next question is from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen.Cai von RumohrSo basically, to follow up on Jason's question, if we take out the loss programs, BDS still was marginally red. And if we take the 60% that should be earning, they should be earning $300 million. So if the 25% losing $300 million, that's the one I really don't understand. How bad is that?And if you say you're going to have modest profits in the third quarter, I mean, again, it looks like there's fairly significant underperformance there. Maybe give us a little more color on the programs involved and what it takes to get them black.Brian J. WestYes. Sure, Cai. So we're not going to have modest profitability in the quarter. I think we said that we're not expecting much at all from the BDS portfolio, just to be clear, because these things aren't going to solve themselves in the near term.Yes, it's a significant gap. It's a hundreds of millions of dollars of swing that we have to go execute to get these handful of programs in a better spot. And they are complicated situations with complicated products and factories that almost went dark during the pandemic. And we've had to bring them back to life.And that takes time because one is to get them up and moving and then also to get the right labor that's trained and knows how to do some very complicated work. So we know what the programs are and how we got to go attack them.It just takes a little bit of time and a little bit longer than anyone expected. But we will make progress, and we'll work our way through it because we know how to make these programs and these products because we've been doing it for a while.Cai von RumohrIs there a -- is part of the problem that you got stuck with contracts, those are mostly fixed-price contracts and with inflation and all this disruption, that's the problem? And if so, do any of those contracts reach their end so that you can basically get better pricing going forward?David L. CalhounYes. Let me just comment on that. Not really. So we're going to have to live within this envelope with respect to pricing and contracts. We might get some ups here and there and modifications here and there, but I wouldn't say that's the answer to this.The answer is really to get a line that started from 0 because it was more or less dark, as Brian said, and get it up to pace. A couple of these products are -- they're not the same old product. There's actually a lot of new, I'll call it, capabilities embedded in these products.You can imagine what those are. I can't talk about them on the call. And so we're just working our way through learning curves. If we didn't see progress on those learning curves, we wouldn't be giving you the guidance that we're going to be back to where we were. We do see progress. It's not an act we haven't seen before. It does take time, frustrating for everybody, but we're getting there.OperatorThe next question is from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnDave, you've been really clear on no new airplane right now. But at the same time, you've talked about and Boeing is working on the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing aircraft, which seems to be a pretty exciting design for the narrow-body market.And while I know it's early in that process, do you think it has a chance to enter service with current gen engines like the LEAP or the GTF and then maybe later take on a CFM rise? And then as a second part to this question, could this aircraft actually service the large narrow-body market as well, something against the 321?David L. CalhounYes. Look, I'm glad to get the question. We're heavily invested in this. We like what it could potentially deliver to this market, a level of performance that the industry is used to seeing with brand-new programs.So now for me to pick and choose the variations and the power plants at this stage is probably not smart. Suffice to say, we are intent on proving this technology. We are hopeful. And if it matures the way we think it will and NASA, frankly, thinks it will, I do think it will see service.And then those power plant decisions will be exciting. You are right, we can use existing power, but we would prefer, frankly, to have a bigger fan diameter ultimately and maybe even open rotor someday. So those are all considerations without a doubt.I don't want to make choices too early. But all of those options that you're talking about are still out there. We just have to prove and mature the technology. If it behaves like it did in the wind tunnel, we're in a pretty good place.OperatorYour next question is from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagOn the 737 MAX production rate increases to 38 per month, can you just give us more insight in terms of what's happening with the supply chain? What's their health? And any particular bottlenecks that you're monitoring in order for you to get to that rate? And any other additional color regarding the timing of this step-up would be appreciated as well.Brian J. WestYes, Kristine, we're there. And we're confident that the supply chain is coordinated to deliver on this. They've known about it for a while, and we're happy to be able to move forward. So we feel very confident.In terms of subsequent step-ups, the master schedule that's been out there is clear on what those look like. And we'll do it a step at a time, and we're happy we can make this first move to 38.David L. CalhounMost of our time and applied effort with respect to the supply chain is focused on readiness for the 50.Kristine Tan LiwagGreat. And then you guys had mentioned that after 38, it would be 42 after you've seen some stability. That stability, I mean, what are you guys looking for? Is it a few months of 38? Is it 6 months of 38? And what do you have to see to get you confident to move over to the next step-up of 42 per month?David L. CalhounYes. It is as you suggest, 38 has to come and has to come in a stable form so that we're not up and down every month. But maybe more important than that, we now have such good visibility into the supply chain. We know whether they're ready for the next -- for 40, 42, 44, et cetera.So I just think it's the combination of much better visibility on each of those step-ups and, yes, our own factories assembling and delivering at a steady pace. But you'll see all that just like we do.OperatorOur next question is from David Strauss from Barclays.David Egon StraussDave, on 787, it looks like deliveries are off to a slow start here in July. I know you reiterated 70 to 80. There's some things swirling around out there that you're encountering some sort of new issue on the 87. Can you just address that?Brian J. WestYes. There's no new issue on the 87. Let's be very clear. There might have been a tick up in the stringer a few weeks ago, but we are very focused on both the joint verification work on the 87 and then getting stable at 4 and then work our way to 5. So 87, we feel particularly good about. And we're very confident in that 70 to 80 deliveries for this year.David L. CalhounYes, I'll just reiterate, Brian jumped me. But yes, we're actually feeling pretty good about the stability of the line and the -- there is no new issue.David Egon StraussOkay. Great. Quick follow-up probably for Brian. So the BCA forecast, the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion operating cash flow this year, you've got an up arrow there. So what is surprising to the upside? I mean you're still running through big unit losses. Is it just upside from working capital advances coming in sooner than expected or better than expected? Is that the upside in terms of what that up arrow signifies?Brian J. WestBingo. It's the orders and it's the advances that's just better than we had thought.OperatorOur next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein.Douglas Stuart HarnedYou've maintained your guidance for 2025, '26 to 50 a month on the MAX. It appears you've got demand that can be well in excess of that. And you've talked about the likelihood of even new orders coming in. And you've got the new line that should be finished in Everett next year some time.Can you talk about how you think about that line, where you could potentially go on rate? And how you deal with potential new orders coming in when kind of the skyline you've got laid out here is it probably pushes you out to like 2028 or so and the ability to take an order?David L. CalhounYes, Doug, why don't I take this? You're right. I guess the truth is, I think both us and our competitors face that circumstance of having to take orders now quite a ways out there. I would love to get to 60, and the market is there for it. There's no doubt about it.For me, there's a moment in time that is really important with respect to execution and the subject of stability, and that is second half of next year when we wind down all of our shadow factory efforts that we can apply all of the labor to those rate increases. So we already have the labor in-house, but now we get them to work on new airplanes.And that's a very good thing, and you know the economics attached to that. It's just not a simple thing to do. And I don't want any of us to get ahead of ourselves on this front. So we're just going to stay focused. We're going to work hard on stability.Second half of '24 is a very important moment in time because I believe that's the step change for BCA in pretty much every way. And if we get through that well and we execute well, then we'll be talking to all of you about 60. But I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one and either does the team.Douglas Stuart HarnedBut in principle, you can do the 50 out of Renton on your current 3 lines. So how are you thinking about -- there would be some more logistical complexity presumably doing one line in Everett. How would you use that even if you aren't up at 60 yet?David L. CalhounWell, again, I'm -- having a little too much capacity is not a problem for us right now when you're trying to knock down stability. So if we run something at a suboptimal level, it's not going to cost us much, and it's going to improve stability and delivery and all those things.So again, I don't -- I want to be careful. I don't want to get out that far and talk about trades at that moment. But right now, we're just focused on stability. We want to have more capacity than we need so that we're ready for that next increment. And that workforce transition is probably the most important part of all of it.OperatorYour next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanBrian, I wanted to ask about the 787 and kind of you talked about some confidence in the pace of the production ramps and deliveries there. First, any particular items to watch in the supply chain?And second, if you could start to help us think a little bit about deliveries next year because if you're building 60 or 70 planes and you're supposed to deliver most of the remaining inventory, it suggests potential for a pretty big delivery hall next year. So both in terms of what is the potential for that to make sure that we understand what is and also so we don't get overly exuberant about what it might be.Brian J. WestWell, I'll be less than satisfying for you because I just can't -- I really can't talk about next year delivery numbers. And it's just not the right time to do that. Although we still have confidence as we get out of the first half of this year, the second half will be better. And then we'll just want to make sure we're always sequentially improving.As it pertains to the 87, very proud of that team, given where they've been over the last couple of years. They've got the joint verification work, very steady, consistent. They're working on their share of escapes that they knock down as fast as they see them. And they're getting to production rates that are steady.And they're getting to that 5 per month by the end of the year is a big deal and no longer are they in the abnormal category. They're back to a path where we expect them. And then there'll be, obviously, increases from there to get to the 10 by '25, '26.So there's nothing in particular right now that is a major [worry bead] for 87. And the supply chain still feels like it's getting better, a little more stable, a little more coordinated. And we got to keep executing.OperatorAnd your next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America.Ronald Jay EpsteinOne topic we just haven't talked about much so far is China. Maybe can you update us on kind of how that's going and your sense on delivering new aircraft into China and what's going on there? I think that could be pretty helpful.David L. CalhounYes. Yes, Ron. So you probably saw in our disclosures that we reduced our exposure, at least with respect to the finished goods inventory, down to 85. Of course, we did that with the permission and constructed dialogue with our customers in China.The return-to-service work in China with respect to the airplanes that were already there is largely complete. Everybody is very happy with the performance. In fact, the reliability of the fleet has been fantastic.And we're getting a lot of good signs that they'll resume delivery, but I'm not going to predict that for you. We're just going to keep managing it exactly the way we have been. We are not dependent on it.We want to do it, and we certainly want to support our customers in China. And we will be the free trade beacon with respect to our administration and all the political influences. But I'm just going to leave it posture just the way it has been. I know that we have 85 airplanes that we would like to begin delivery on. We're getting good signals. I hope it can happen. Our guidance is not dependent on it.Ronald Jay EpsteinGot it. And then maybe one quick follow-up, if I may. We've talked a little bit about product development. Just wanted to get your thoughts on what A220 stretch 500 may or may not mean. It seems like Airbus is going to do it, at least that's the signals they're sending and just how you guys think about it?David L. CalhounHonestly, I've probably been curt and maybe too curt with my answers, but I really don't think about it. I don't view it as a meaningful competitor. There's nothing that I would want to do on the product development front to respond to it. It's not the world that we're interested in.We like our portfolio. The next airplane, in my view, with respect to development has to be a meaningful change, 25%, 30% better than what flies today. That's why we're focused on Transonic wings. That is -- that's just our game plan. And I don't think -- based on all the competitions that we've touched and all the speculation that we hear, I just don't think it's going to be a meaningful difference.Matt WelchLois, we have time for one final question.OperatorAnd that question will come from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.Noah PoponakMaybe just a few, some last follow-ups or things that haven't been asked. The leadership of the company had been out around the air show talking about the MAX maybe getting to 42 a month by the end of the year. I mean, is that the official plan? Or can you talk about that?Pricing, the checks that we have access to are saying that new aircraft pricing is up a double-digit percentage compared to pre-pandemic. Is that what you're seeing?And then in the defense margin next year, with the way you see the milestones laying out and the progress on the cost that you're going after, can you have some reasonable low to mid-single-digit margin in the defense business next year? Or is that 2025 plan more back-end loaded?Brian J. WestSo I'll take the last one. Our defense margins have to get better next year, period, full stop. I won't guess in terms of at what level, but they got to get better as we go in the trajectory to that '25, '26 time frame.And as it pertains to that 42 number, we're talking about 38 today and happy to talk about 38. There's a master schedule that the supply chain has, and they know all those rate breaks. And we'll talk about that more specifically when we want to move to it. But there's no confusion about where the next rate breaks are. We just want to (inaudible) focused on one, the 38 and then as Dave mentioned, the preparation for the entire supply chain to get to a number of 50 in that '25, '26 time frame. As Dave mentioned, that's where most of the focus is. All those interim breaks, they'll be what they are. And we'll get excited to get to them as we have stability from one point to another.David L. CalhounAnd the good news is I'm not surprised at all that our team is conveying those messages. I'm not surprised because we're all in that prep mode.Noah PoponakOkay. And anything you could say on current realized aircraft pricing?David L. CalhounYes, I can't -- I'm not going to give you any specific numbers. Let me just say that the industry is short of airplanes by a reasonably large margin. Boy, do we compete, I'll tell you that, for every one of these orders because they're big and they're important. But as you might expect in a constrained market, things probably get better.Matt WelchAnd that concludes our second quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining.OperatorThank you.

Welcome to the Universal Stainless &amp; Alloy Products Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to June Filingeri. Please go ahead.June FilingeriThank you. Good morning. This is June Filingeri of Comm-Partners, and I'd also like to welcome you to the Universal Stainless call and webcast. We are here to discuss the company's second quarter 2023 results reported this morning. With us from management are Denny Oates, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Zimmer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; John Arminas, Vice President and General Counsel; and Steve DiTommaso, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to management, let me quickly review procedures. After management has made formal remarks, we will take your questions. The conference operator Norma -- sorry about that, will take your questions. Also, please note that in this morning's call, management will make forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. I would like to remind you of the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in today's press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With the formalities complete, I would now like to turn the call over to Denny Oates. Denny, we are ready to begin.Dennis M. OatesOkay, June, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. The main highlight of our second quarter performance is improving profitability, a product of the positive momentum we described on our last call. More specifically, gross profit margin reached 14.3% of sales despite an across-the-board drop in commodity metal prices that resulted in negative surcharge misalignment of about $0.5 million. First quarter gross margin was 11.7%. The margin improvement in the most recent quarter led to a more than doubling of operating income to $3.1 million. We turned the corner on bottom line profitability with net income reaching $900,000 or $0.10 per diluted share. The main drivers of second quarter profitability were higher shipment volume, both sequentially and year-over-year, increased production, improved productivity at key operations, and higher base selling prices. We announced 2 additional price increases in the second quarter on bar and plate products. Adjusted EBITDA of almost $8 million in the second quarter was the highest achieved since the second quarter of 2019 and increased 17% from last quarter. Looking at our top line, net sales remained strong at $69 million, an increase of 5% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. That's the highest level since the second quarter of 2019. Year-to-date sales reached $135 million, an increase of 35% over last year. The second quarter sales included premium alloy sales of $12.9 million, which is 27% lower than the record first quarter, but 46% higher than the second quarter of 2022. Year-to-date premium alloy sales were up 72% to $30.5 million or 23% of sales. We expect premium product sales to be above Q1's record levels during the second half of the year. Our premium alloy sales are for aerospace applications. Aerospace sales increased 5% to a record $51 million in the second quarter, up 44% year-over-year and up 52% year-to-date. In the last call, we pointed to an expected modest improvement in sales in the second quarter, with growth accelerating during the second half of the year. Second quarter sales, including premium alloys, were in line with our plans. Our positive outlook for the final 2 quarters of the year remains unchanged. It's based on the continued strength in demand for our products, especially our premium alloys, tempered somewhat by seasonality and declining surcharges. June 30 total order backlog before surcharges remained robust at $355 million, but fell $11 million from Q1's record high as we work with customers to control our order entry. The backlog of orders scheduled to ship over the next 12 months actually increased 6% compared to March 31. We continue to diligently work to reduce extended lead times. Premium alloys continue to represent about 35% of our backlog. Turning to our financial position, total debt was reduced by $6.2 million to $93.3 million during the quarter. Revolver availability remained unchanged at an adequate $24 million. Managed working capital was $148 million, down $1.5 million sequentially, representing about 54% of sales. Receivables are in good shape with DSO falling to 41 from 50 at year-end 2022. Inventory at the end of the second quarter increased a modest 1.4% to $152 million, reflecting improved turns, partially offset by higher volumes of premium grades and work in process. Second quarter capital expenditures were $2.4 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $6.9 million. We expect full year capital expenditures of about $16 million, with about half of that amount for our investment in remelt capacity at our North Jackson facility, where we are adding 2 Vacuum-Arc Remelt furnaces. The equipment installation is underway, and we are working towards full integration of operations beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Our objective is to expand our product portfolio with more technologically advanced, higher-margin premium products to enhance our capabilities, our cost structure, and also, our growth prospects. We continued to deepen our management team in the second quarter with the naming of Rick Secola as Vice President of Supply Chain and Purchasing. Rick is a 13-year veteran of Universal and most recently served as Universal's Supply Chain Director. He reports directly to Chris Zimmer, our recently named Chief Operating Officer. Two additional updates. We announced separately today that we have engaged Baker Tilly as our new auditor, effective following the filing of our second quarter 10-Q. Baker Tilly replaces Schneider Downs, who has been our auditor of record for over 20 years. We have been pleased with the quality of professional services that Schneider Downs has provided, and we look forward to working with an audit firm of the caliber of Baker Tilly. Additionally, we are currently in negotiations with our new labor agreement with the union representing the hourly employees at our Bridgeville facility. The current 5-year agreement expires on August 31. Chris, I'll turn the call over to you for your review of operations.Story continuesChristopher M. ZimmerThank you, Denny, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with premium alloys in our vacuum induction melting operations, which are the critical platform for our growth strategy. While premium alloy sales were sequentially lower in the second quarter due to shipment timing, our results year-to-date are 72% higher than the first half of 2022, and we remain on track for a record year of sales in 2023. Operationally, we achieved record vacuum induction melting productivity during the second quarter, which supports our rapidly growing premium alloy sales planned for the second half of this year. Despite continued challenges stabilizing our workforce, we were able to increase our total production sequentially and expect additional production increases in the third quarter. Production levels at our remelt shops, hot-working mills, and major finishing units all improved sequentially as we continue our march back to pre-COVID production levels. As most of you know, Rolls-Royce has been a longstanding customer of ours, and I'm pleased to report that Universal was again named to the Rolls-Royce High Performance Supplier Group for 2023. This is a very short list of suppliers, and we are proud of the great job that our team has done to receive this recognition. Turning to commodities, nickel continued to slide in the second quarter declining 9% sequentially into the low $9 per pound range. Other metals followed suit with nearly every metal we track down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The reasons for the decline are mainly weak manufacturing and trade data from China, weaker European demand, and concerns about further monetary policy tightening in the U.S. and the effect on the U.S. dollar. Overall, we expect negative surcharge misalignment for the third quarter. Let's turn to end markets, beginning with aerospace, our largest market. We saw additional growth in our aerospace sales in the second quarter of 2023, which increased 5% to a record $51.3 million or 74% of sales compared to $49 million and 74% of sales in the first quarter of 2023. Aerospace sales increased 44% from $35.7 million in the second quarter of 2022. And year-to-date, sales totaled $1 million, an increase of 52% from the same period 2022. The drivers of commercial aerospace demand continued to gain momentum in the second quarter. Consumer demand is up. The pace of deliveries at Boeing and Airbus has increased. Carriers are turning over their fleets for more fuel-efficient planes, and build rates are ramping up. We attended the Paris Air Show last month, and it was one of the most positive shows in memory. Looking at the airplane manufacturers, Boeing delivered 136 planes in the second quarter with a better-than-expected 60 deliveries in June. Boeing's orders were strong in the second quarter at 460 planes, including a 220-plane order from Air India. At the end of June, Boeing's net backlog stood at over 4,800 planes. With the continued increase in backlog and strong Q2 deliveries, Boeing is increasing the 737 MAX monthly build rate to 38 from the current rate of 31 and plans to reach 50 in the 2025 to 2026 timeframe. We should learn more about Boeing's plans on their call this morning. At Airbus, June deliveries totaled 72, bringing year-to-date deliveries to 316. Airbus had gross orders in June of 902 planes, including a firm order for 500 A320 family aircraft from IndiGo, India's largest airline. That order set the record for the biggest single purchase agreement in the history of commercial aviation. Earlier this month, Airbus opened a new assembly line for the A321neo in Southwest France, part of its efforts to reach a build rate of 75 on the A320 family by 2026 amid record demand. The current build rate is at 45 planes per month. IATA added more good news in their May report. Total air traffic in May increased 39% from May of 2022, and global traffic is now at 96% of the pre-pandemic levels. Domestic traffic for May rose 36%, making it the second month in a row that it has exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, international traffic jumped 41% versus May of 2022 with all markets recording strong growth. In the U.S., TSA recorded impressive passenger volume of 2.9 million on May 30 versus 2.5 million on that date in 2022 and 2.2 million in 2019. Volume had fallen to 800,000 in 2020. That healthy activity translated into record revenue and profits at Delta Airlines, which reported robust domestic demand and record international performance in the second quarter. The company expects the same high level of demand to continue through the quarter. United Airlines and American Airlines also reported record results in the quarter. Defense market demand continues to be driven by the global conflicts that we read about daily. Lockheed Martin, for example, reported record backlog in the end of the second quarter, including a $7.8 billion contract from the Pentagon for 26 F-35 fighters. In rotorcraft, our customer Bell Textron received the go-ahead to move forward with manufacturing its tilt rotor aircraft, the V-280 Valor, the U.S. Army's future attack helicopter which will eventually replace Sikorsky's Black Hawk. In other deals, Germany will purchase 60 chinook helicopters from Boeing. The purchase is a part of a shift in policy following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The challenge for both commercial aerospace and defense manufacturers is to overcome continued supply chain shortages to increase build rates. The parallel challenge for Universal's customers is to meet the enormous demand for our products, which is expected to continue through 2024 and beyond. Customers are fully in a pull mode. They describe their inventories as hand to mouth and have a record backlog of orders waiting for material from the mills. The heavy equipment market remained our second largest market in the second quarter of '23, with sales of $8.9 million or 13% of sales, up 29% from sales in the first quarter of '23 and up 24% from the second quarter of 2022. Metal fabrication demand drives our heavy equipment market sales mainly for automotive applications, especially model changeovers. The strong sales pickup we saw in the first quarter continued in the second as customers continue to replenish inventories of plate product. While demand in the heavy equipment market can be lumpy, we expect our sales to that market to remain solid in the third quarter. The general industrial market became our third largest market in the second quarter of '23, with sales of $2.3 million or 5% of sales, which is down 7% from the first quarter of '23, but up 76% from the second quarter of 2022. Our general industrial sales are mainly for semiconductor manufacturing. Based on market outlook, we are bullish about 2024 with the ramp-up beginning in the second half of this year. The oil and gas market moved down to fourth place in the second quarter of 2023 with sales of $3.1 million or 4% of sales versus $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Demand in the oil and gas market in the second quarter was negatively impacted by market softness in North America, including muted drilling activity in the U.S. as indicated in lower rig counts. Baker Hughes, Halliburton, and Schlumberger are all expecting softness in the U.S. land market to continue in the second half of 2023. While the long-term prospects for our oil and gas segment are positive, we are temporarily shifting more of our capacity to higher-margin aerospace products to better respond to the enormous demand in that market. Power generation market sales totaled $1.3 million or 2% of sales in the second quarter of '23, a 23% increase from $1.1 million in the first quarter. Our power generation sales is program-specific, heavily reliant upon maintenance of industrial gas turbines for electricity generation. We remain positioned to benefit from any additional maintenance opportunities following this unusually hot summer and any ongoing investment in new domestic gas turbines. Now let me turn the call over to Steve for his report on our financials.Steven V. DiTommasoThank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This quarter, we grew the topline by more than $3 million sequentially or about 5%, driven by higher base pricing and more shipment volume despite the lower mix of premium product and falling surcharges. Compared with the second quarter of the prior year, our total net sales increased nearly $17 million or 32%, while our premium product sales are up by more than $4 million. Our second quarter gross margin totaled $9.8 million or 14.3% of sales, the highest quarterly gross margin percentage since 2018. Consistent with our plan, as we advance through this year, the margin expansion is a result of higher base prices, strong production volume, and improved cost absorption and more shipment volume. And in the current quarter, these benefits overcame negative misalignment between our materials cost and the surcharge component of our total sales price from the impact of falling commodity metal prices. Selling, general and administrative costs totaled $6.8 million in Q2 compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter and $5.3 million in the second quarter of last year. Although lower as a percent of sales when compared to last year, the $1.5 million increase is driven by higher property insurance costs and higher employee-related costs. As a result of the higher gross margin, we earned operating income of $3.1 million, which more than doubled the first quarter and was $3.6 million better than the loss posted in the second quarter of last year. However, interest expense remained high compared to prior years, and at $2 million was approximately flat to Q1. Despite paying down our revolver by $6 million as a part of reducing our overall net debt position by $5 million, the variable interest rates we paid continued to rise through the quarter. The rate on the majority of our debt fluctuates with term SOFR under the terms of our credit agreement. Term SOFR is currently hovering just above 5% and was around 4.5% throughout the first quarter and 1.5% at this time last year. Accordingly, our average borrowing rate for Q2 was about 8.5%, which compares to 8.2% in Q1 and 4.4% in Q2 of last year. We posted pretax income of just over $1 million and recorded a provision for income taxes of $148,000, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14.2% for the quarter. Consistent with our discussion on prior calls, our estimated annual effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate of 21% due to the beneficial impact of research and development credits. Other items and discrete items during the quarter are not significant. Our net income for the quarter was about $900,000. Our diluted shares outstanding reported in Q2 increased to $9.3 million and our earnings per diluted share were $0.10. The Q2 performance brought us into a year-to-date net income position as well, totaling about $400,000 or $0.04 per diluted share. EBITDA was $7.6 million, which is $1.2 million better than last quarter and the highest level since the second quarter of 2019, while adjusted EBITDA totaled $7.9 million, including an add-back for noncash share compensation expense. The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA for each period presented is provided in the tables within the press release. During the second quarter, we generated $7.7 million of cash from our operations despite investing $2.6 million in inventory, which primarily resulted from 2 record vacuum induction melt production campaigns executed during the 2023 second quarter. In total, we generated cash from our managed working capital as we drove accounts receivable down to $31.3 million, delivering a DSO of 41, and we grew accounts payable modestly in line with inventory. We used $2.4 million of cash on capital expenditures during Q2 and our free cash flow of $5.2 million was used to pay down debt. Additionally, our available borrowings under our revolving credit facility remained flat compared to March 31 at about $24 million, despite the expiration of our temporary credit agreement amendment that provided access to additional inventory collateral value throughout the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2022 and through March 31 of this year. This liquidity position, coupled with our ongoing expectation of positive quarterly operating cash flow, provides sufficient liquidity for our operations and market opportunity for the foreseeable future. This concludes my report, and I'll hand the call back to Denny.Dennis M. OatesOkay. Thanks, Steve. Let me summarize. We moved forward in strengthening our profitability and cash flow in the second quarter. Gross margins reached 14.3% of sales despite negative surcharge misalignment and lower premium product sales. Higher shipping volume, increased production, productivity and yield improvements and higher selling prices all contributed to the margin expansion. We turned the corner on bottom line profitability with net income approaching $1 million or $0.10 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% to $8 million. Total debt was reduced by 6%. Working capital metrics improved across the board. Second quarter sales remained strong at $69 million, growing 5% sequentially, consistent with our plan and expectations. Sales were 34% higher year-over-year and up 35% year-to-date, reaching $135 million. Premium alloy sales were up 46% year-over-year, but down 27% sequentially due to shipment timing. Demand for our premium products remains at record levels. So does our backlog, which contains over 35% premium alloy product as demand in commercial aerospace, in the commercial aerospace market, continues to surge. Our major capital project at North Jackson remains on track, and we are working to have it operational in the first quarter of 2024. We continued to develop our organization during the quarter with the recent appointment of Rick Secola, a 13-year veteran with Universal, as Vice President, Supply Chain and Purchasing. Our second half outlook is for sequential quarterly sales growth, fueled by a solid backlog, increasing base prices and improving mix of premium product shipments, tempered somewhat by declining surcharges and normal seasonality. We further expect these topline trends, coupled with increased production to yield improved gross profit margins, positive cash flow and further debt reduction. Let me conclude by recognizing our exceptionally talented team of hourly and salaried employees for their dedication and hard work during the quarter and over the last several years. They have my sincere gratitude, as do our board, our customers and our stockholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Norma, let's take some questions from our callers.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Philip Ross GibbsYou all mentioned surcharge misalignment in the second quarter despite having pretty solid gross margins anyways. Any way to couch what that may have been either on a dollar or a percentage basis? And then maybe the same thing as it relates to how you're thinking about the third quarter?Dennis M. OatesWell, we've seen declining commodities during the second quarter, so we know surcharges are going to be lower in the third quarter versus the second. At the same time, our material costs should be drifting down as well. As that comes together in the third quarter, our best estimate, Phil, would be misalignment would be negative, and it would be about the same amount as we saw in the second quarter on a sequential basis.Philip Ross GibbsNot really any worse than what you already experienced in Q2? And was that 100 basis points roughly, or more or less?Steven V. DiTommasoAbout $500,000.Dennis M. Oates$500 million over 69 would be the -- is that what you're asking?Philip Ross GibbsYes.Dennis M. OatesYes.Philip Ross GibbsOkay, so similar amounts in the third quarter as of right now is what you're saying?Dennis M. OatesRight.Philip Ross GibbsAnd then just the housekeeping, you had given some color on general items. What's the update just in terms of the amount of liquidity that you have right now? And then also, what should we be modeling for the book tax rate for the back half?Steven V. DiTommasoYes. Right now, as we begin to step through Q3, we're basically flat to the end of Q2, so still at that $24 million level. And we are forecasting debt paydown in the third and fourth quarters. Probably not at the same level of the second quarter, but with our incremental improving margins and growing sales, even though CapEx we expect to increase in the second half of the year, we will pay down debt in the third and fourth quarters and expand liquidity as well.Philip Ross Gibbs$24 million as of now on that. And then tax rate was somewhat unique, maybe perhaps too low in the first half. Should we expect the back half to be more normal, kind of 20%, 25%?Steven V. DiTommasoYes, that's right. More normalized back half on the tax rate.Philip Ross GibbsOkay. And then as it relates to your mix and your pricing, that seems like it's more than going to overcome this misalignment piece just from a timing perspective. How many quarters or visibility do you have in terms of that mix and pricing dynamic continuing to improve? Because I know you're turning over that backlog with sort of a richer outcome.Steven V. DiTommasoWell, for the 2 components of our selling price, the base prices are known. A lot of our bar products and aerospace products are booked largely over the next 4 quarters, and we will see sequential base price improvement in each one of those quarters. It gets a little cloudier on the surcharge front. We do know that the surcharges in the third quarter will drift down, but it remains to be seen what the fourth quarter or 2024 will look like. We continue to manage our inventories tightly, to turn our inventories to keep up with those changes. Our expectation is that unless there is a wild spike in either direction, it should not have a significant impact on margins. And again, the sales surcharge component will track with commodities.Philip Ross GibbsThank you. And then lastly, as it relates to the VIM and kind of VAR complex finally really strongly finding its footing at this point in time, are you gaining the wins and share that you would have hoped to have seen a couple of years ago with the forgers and maybe some of the OEM direct customers? Is that the idea behind it? Because I know, obviously, a lot of your business historically has been transactional, so just maybe anything you could say at a high level relative to that. Thanks.Steven V. DiTommasoYes, that's right. We're now enjoying the benefits of the product development and the approvals that we've gained throughout the years. We're picking up share. That's where a lot of the growth in the backlog is coming from. The market is stronger, but for sure, we are into some new customers, new applications that we were not in before with some of these new VIM products. We continue to have more and more conversations, some really good things coming out of the air show. I expect us to continue to build upon the successes we're having this year as we move into '24 and I don't see any reason why this momentum won't continue beyond '24. That is one of the big parts of the success story here is the additional VIM sales that are coming largely through share gains riding the back of a strong market.Philip Ross GibbsAnd just kind of a sub question to that, is the North Jackson complex, is that from a mix standpoint richer than the broader portfolio? Or is it about the same?Steven V. DiTommasoIt's generally richer. The North Jackson plant and our plant up in Dunkirk are largely aerospace driven. The Bridgeville plant is where we have our semi-finished products to the general industrial market, things like tool steel plate. That's a bigger part of what the Bridgeville plant does. The Bridgeville plant is also the primary feeder of input stock to North Jackson and Dunkirk. But as I look at those 3 plants, North Jackson, Dunkirk, and our Titusville plant as well, are all very much aerospace-focused in the products that they put into the market.Operator(Operator Instructions) I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back to Mr. Oates for closing remarks.Dennis M. OatesThank you, Norma. Once again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We moved forward with our strategy in the second quarter. We remain optimistic about our growth prospects for the remainder of this year and well into 2024 and 2025. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call, which will be in October. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of the summer. Be well, and stay safe. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.]"

However, oncologists often opt for single-gene tests (SGT) before pursuing CGP.A new study, conducted by Labcorp and presented last month at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, showed that SGTs use up precious biopsy samples, reducing CGP effectiveness and depriving patients of comprehensive genomic information about their tumors.""This study shows that just doing a single-gene test, which is a legacy process from a decade ago, denies and delays care,"" said Dr. Vivek Subbiah, MD, now chief of Early-Phase Drug Development at Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, Tennessee, who presented the study.The 2022 study looked at non-small-cell lung cancer samples from 580 patients at more than 80 community oncology practices. While SGT can identify several well-known mutations and structural variations, CGP interrogates nearly 600 genes associated with tumor growth, resistance, and other traits.To better illustrate the study's ramifications for precision medicine, Dr. Phil Febbo, senior vice president and chief medical officer at Illumina, moderated a fireside chat at the ASCO meeting. He was joined by Subbiah and by Dr. Prasanth Reddy, a medical oncologist.""We're hearing about some incredible innovations on the therapy side,"" Febbo said. ""More and more of these innovations are dependent on understanding an individual's tumor and the different molecular changes in the tumor. That means choosing the right tests has become crucial for cancer care.""The impact of SGTs on CGP The study showed that CGP was used as a secondary diagnostic in 29% of participants. In those cases, 89% of CGP tests used material from the same tumor sample as the primary SGT, which reduced CGP efficacy-there simply wasn't enough viable tumor tissue for effective testing. When there had been no prior SGT, or when CGP used a different sample, CGP provided more detailed information about tumor genomics.Story continuesOverall, prior SGT reduced CGP's ability to detect important variants by 8%. In addition, prior SGT increased CGP turnaround times from a median 13 days to 20 days.""If you look at the failure rate when you do single-gene testing up front, it's twice as high as when you do CGP up front,"" said Reddy. ""And there are other implications, such as turnaround time, which is extended. Those are meaningful days, during which a patient has a diagnosis and needs to start therapy, and we're delaying the initiation of therapy because we don't have the right answers.""The changing oncology landscape The panelists were unanimous on the need to move away from this two-step process and simply start with CGP. One of the major concerns is that SGTs often provide incomplete information, leading to ineffective treatments.""We know patients with RET-fusion-positive lung cancers do not do well with immunotherapy,"" said Subbiah. ""However, if they get a single-gene test, EGFR is negative and they don't test for RET, they will start that patient on immunotherapy. It's delaying the appropriate treatments and denying patients the gift of time.""Getting this right is critically important. Genomic diagnostics is the most precise way to characterize a tumor and get patients the care they need.""To win the war against cancer, we need to have every ounce of intelligence about it, and genomics should be a part of that process,"" said Subbiah. ""Years ago, when I saw a patient with 100, 200, 300 mutations, I knew there wasn't a lot we could do for them. Now, I get excited when I see a patient whose tumor has hundreds of mutations, because they become the best candidates for immunotherapy.""This study, and other evidence, has shown that comprehensive testing provides better clinical insights to guide care. The next step will be to ensure all patients have access to primary CGP.""Maybe we can't help every single patient, but we better help the folks that should be helped,"" said Reddy. ""The first step is ensuring that everybody has access to world-class testing. From there, hopefully, we have the right information to put each patient on the right drug at the right time.""To watch a video of the entire panel discussion, click here.Illumina, Wednesday, July 26, 2023, Press release picturePhoto: Dr. Phil Febbo, Dr. Vivek Subbiah, and Dr. Prasanth Reddy at ASCO 2023.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/770472/New-Research-Shows-CGP-Is-Most-Effective-as-a-Standalone-Test]"

The current annual dividend rate is $5.60 per common share. The timing and amount of future dividends will depend on actual cash flows from operations, MAA's financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other factors as MAA's Board of Directors deems relevant. MAA's Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy from time to time.2023 Earnings and Same Store Portfolio GuidanceMAA is updating its prior 2023 guidance for Earnings per common share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share. MAA expects to update its full year 2023 Earnings per common share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share guidance on a quarterly basis.FFO, Core FFO and Core AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures. Acquisition and disposition activity materially affects depreciation and capital gains or losses, which combined, generally represent the majority of the difference between Net income available for common shareholders and FFO. As discussed in the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures found later in this release, MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts', or NAREIT's, definition, and Core FFO represents FFO further adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA's core business operations. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that Core FFO excludes not only depreciation expense of real estate assets and certain other non-routine items, but it also excludes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.2023 GuidancePrevious RangePrevious MidpointRevised RangeRevised MidpointEarnings:Full Year 2023Full Year 2023Full Year 2023Full Year 2023Earnings per common share - diluted$6.05 to $6.41$6.23$5.04 to $5.32$5.18Core FFO per Share - diluted$8.93 to $9.29$9.11$9.00 to $9.28$9.14Core AFFO per Share - diluted$8.01 to $8.37$8.19$8.08 to $8.36$8.22MAA Same Store Portfolio:Property revenue growth5.25% to 7.25%6.25 %5.50% to 7.00%6.25 %Property operating expense growth5.15% to 7.15%6.15 %5.30% to 6.80%6.05 %NOI growth5.30% to 7.30%6.30 %5.60% to 7.10%6.35 % MAA expects Core FFO for the third quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.34 per Share, or $2.26 per Share at the midpoint.

purposes of calculations in this release, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate, or Adjusted EBITDAre, represents EBITDAre further adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA's core operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, gain or loss on investments, casualty related (recoveries) charges, net, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, legal costs and settlements, net and COVID-19 related costs. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Adjusted EBITDAre to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDAre does not include various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. MAA's computation of Adjusted EBITDAre may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Adjusted EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indicator of operating performance.Core Adjusted Funds from Operations (Core AFFO)Core AFFO is composed of Core FFO less recurring capital expenditures. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, Core AFFO, when used in this release, represents Core AFFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders. Core AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Core AFFO to be an important measure of performance from operations because Core AFFO measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and recurring capital expenditures.Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO)Core FFO represents FFO as adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA's core business operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, gain or loss on investments, net of tax, casualty related (recoveries) charges, net, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, legal costs and settlements, net, COVID-19 related costs, mark-to-market debt adjustments and other non-core items. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, Core FFO, when used in this release, represents Core FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders. While MAA's definition of Core FFO may be similar to others in the industry, MAA's methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding its core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.EBITDAFor purposes of calculations in this release, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA, is composed of net income plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income taxes. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indicator of operating performance.EBITDAreFor purposes of calculations in this release, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate, or EBITDAre, is composed of EBITDA further adjusted for the gain or loss on sale of depreciable asset sales and adjustments to reflect MAA's share of EBITDAre of an unconsolidated affiliate. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers EBITDAre to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDAre does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. While MAA's definition of EBITDAre is in accordance with NAREIT's definition, it may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate EBITDAre. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indicator of operating performance.Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)FAD is composed of Core FFO less total capital expenditures, excluding development spending, property acquisitions, capital expenditures relating to significant casualty losses that management expects to be reimbursed by insurance proceeds and corporate related capital expenditures. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, FAD, when used in this release, represents FAD attributable to common shareholders and unitholders. FAD should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers FAD to be an important measure of performance from core operations because FAD measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and capital expenditures.Funds From Operations (FFO)FFO represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gain or loss on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and adjustments for joint ventures. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, FFO, when used in this release, represents FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders. While MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with NAREIT's definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies.Gross AssetsGross Assets represents Total assets plus Accumulated depreciation. MAA believes that Gross Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its balance sheet positions.

Cigna believes that the inaccurate portrayal of the PxDx – or ""procedure to diagnosis"" – process may lead to confusion or misunderstanding about how it works and how it is used.   Cigna Healthcare logo (PRNewsfoto/Cigna Healthcare)Here are the facts about this claims review process:PxDx is a simple process that has successfully helped accelerate payments to physicians for common, relatively low-cost tests and treatments over the last several years. The post-treatment review process works through software (not artificial intelligence or an algorithm) that matches the codes submitted by the physician with diagnosis codes that are considered medically necessary for a procedure under Cigna's publicly posted clinical coverage policies.Patients are not denied care through this review in any way – it occurs after the patient has received treatment and once their physician bills for the treatment.Most individuals do not experience any additional costs if their claim is denied via PxDx. If a patient received care from an in-network provider, the provider should not bill them if payment on a specific service is not paid via PxDx.This process is used for approximately 50 low-cost tests and procedures that are only covered for specific diagnoses – such as dermabrasion, chemical peels, or vitamin D screenings.The vast majority of claims reviewed through this process are automatically paid. Claims that are denied for payment through this process represent less than 1% of Cigna Healthcare's total volume of claims.Similar versions of this process are used by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and other health insurers.Story continuesMore information about this claims review process is available here.

The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices is a catalyst. The growing need for faster connections, low latency and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFi-enabled hotspots. The democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry players. These factors have bolstered the demand for radio-frequency semiconductor solutions provided by industry players like Skyworks Solutions SWKS and Qorvo QRVO. Nevertheless, rise in commodity prices, raging inflation, growing interest rates and global macroeconomic uncertainties remain headwinds for industry participants.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers, and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in congested RF spectrum. They serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive, and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.4 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF IndustryAccelerated 5G Deployment is a Tailwind: The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications hold promise for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which are expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. Further, the growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects. Cisco forecasts that the number of hotspots worldwide will reach 600 million in 2023.Innovation is Opening up Business Avenues: The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars, and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects.

""We had eight potential new customers come in for a demonstration of our IBCS capabilities - our integrated battle management system - that has been in very high demand.""Munitions and missile defenses were two other high-demand areas Keffer highlighted.European demand for U.S. weaponry is soaring, but instead of big-ticket items like jets and tanks, shopping lists are focused on cheaper, less-sophisticated items such as shoulder-fired missiles, artillery, and drones that have proven critical to Ukraine's war efforts.Northrop's aeronautic systems business, which houses its new B21 Raider jet program, posted a 2% rise in sales at $2.60 billion in the second quarter.Sales in its space system business, which makes satellites and payloads, jumped 17% to $3.49 billion, helped by a surge in investment for space exploration projects.Northrop raised the lower end of its annual profit forecast from $22.25 per share. It now expects 2023 profit to be in the range of $22.45 to $22.85 per share.Story continuesThe company also raised its annual sales outlook to between $38.4 billion and $38.8 billion, compared with its previous projection of $38 billion to $38.4 billion.Its net earnings came in at $812 million, or $5.34 per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $6.06 a year earlier.Northrop's overall sales in the quarter rose 9% to $9.57 billion.(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington, DC and Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar, Sharon Singleton and Conor Humphries)]"

In a call with investors, Nike CEO and president John Donahoe said the company would continue to invest in the region with innovations and hyper-local activations.More from Footwear NewsAnother 'Panda' Nike Dunk Is Releasing SoonNike Celebrates Puerto Rico With New 'Blue Gale' Air Max 1 Sneakers“Nike remains the No. 1 brand in China and brand momentum is improving,” wrote Sole in a Tuesday note, following a meeting with management. “Nike is further poised to rebound given clean inventory, a full innovation pipeline, and IT investments now in place.”Nike said it had a record-breaking performance during the 6/18 shopping holiday in China, and was the No.1 sports brand on Tmall, Alibaba’s China e-commerce service. Nike is also seeing returns, particularly among Gen Z, from its focus on combining innovation with local storytelling.Nike CFO Matthew Friend said that in the fourth quarter, Nike saw its highest levels of full-price selling in the region in eight quarters.“Innovation is very important in China and Nike believes its new products will help,” wrote Sole. “Nike continues to leverage local insights to make more local products — local fit, color, storytelling.”Compared to other brands with a presence in China, Nike has seen particularly strong momentum in the region since the country reopened in January of 2023, outshining its competitors significantly. In its most recent quarter, Skechers saw a growth of 3 percent growth in China. Adidas was down 9 percent in the region.Notably Puma on Wednesday reported Q2 sales growth in Greater China of 36 percent, though CEO Arne Freundt was cautious about the numbers, saying that 2023 will be more of a “transitional year” for China. Puma’s almost 20 percent growth seen in the first six months of this year will likely continue in the second half of 2023, he predicted.Story continuesNike’s strength in China is bolstered by a strong team of Nike employees situated there. Nike also uses locally driven apps to promote products and connect to consumers on a local level.“Nike is aware of local competitors, but China is still an incredibly attractive market and growing at a rapid rate,” Sole wrote. “Nike feels like it has what it needs to compete.”Looking ahead, Nike expects fiscal year 2024 revenues to grow in the mid-single digits, accounting for headwinds from the wholesale shipping timing from the prior year. In Q1, Nike expects revenues to be flat to up in the low single digits due to its efforts to reduce excess inventory.Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

A higher rate of injuries in the women's game may be due in part to a reliance on boots designed primarily for men, sports scientists say.A recent report coordinated by soccer's European Club Association found as many as 82% of female players in Europe experience discomfort wearing boots. Women often have a lower instep and midfoot than men, for example.Sportswear companies are under scrutiny for not producing enough boots tailored to women: the chair of the British Parliament's Women and Equalities committee wrote to executives at Adidas, Nike, Puma, and Umbro on July 3 noting the high rate of ACL injuries and requesting information about their products for women.""Why are there so few football boots on the market designed specifically for women and girls?"" lawmaker Caroline Nokes wrote in the letter.But the big sports brands are responding, sensing a business opportunity as women's soccer takes off.Nike last month launched a new boot for women, while Adidas on July 4 launched three designs developed and tested with ""an equal gender split of contributors"" from amateur to professional athletes.On Wednesday, Puma CEO Arne Freundt said more than 90 players at the World Cup, hosted by Australia and New Zealand, were wearing Puma boots. A spokesperson said 95% of them were wearing women-fit boots.Puma's UK website shows five styles of soccer boots ""engineered for the female foot,"" priced between 75 pounds ($97) and 200 pounds ($258).""We believe that this women's fit is super important for them to further enhance their performance but also to prevent injuries,"" said Freundt.Story continuesPuma is investing in a research study that will further explore ACL injuries in women's soccer, the company said in a separate statement on Wednesday, with the aim of further developing its women-specific boots among others.Freundt didn't share sales figures for the women's fit boots, saying: ""To be very frank I think we still need to build more awareness around this.""Puma sponsors the Switzerland and Morocco women's teams, as well as individual athletes playing for Italy, Canada, the Netherlands and other teams.The women's World Cup expanded this year to 32 teams, from 24 in 2019, meaning a total of 736 players at the event.($1 = 0.7745 pounds) (Reporting by Linda Pasquini and Helen Reid Editing by Mark Potter)]"

However, this only holds true if you invest in the right stocks. Companies that decline on yields and price – or worse yet, stop giving out dividends altogether – are losing prospects for any investor. It pays to systematically review your portfolio and check if your holdings are aligned with your long-term goals. It might be a difficult decision, but it might be prudent to dump your dying dividend stocks when they no longer serve your overall strategy.Not to be confused with undervalued dividend stocks, this article covers three declining dividend stocks worth selling.  These companies have been underperforming in both growth and earnings, which I’d consider replacing with better opportunities at the earliest opportunity.Edison International (EIX)Southern California Edison sign and logo EIX stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comEdison International (NYSE:EIX) is an electric utility holding company that is operating through its subsidiaries Southern California Edison Company and Edison Energy Group, Inc. The company supplies and delivers electricity in Southern, Central and Coastal California. Their subsidiary Southern California Edison has been a long-time leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe company offers a 4.19% dividend yield, which is high for its size and may look attractive at first glance. However, the problem with the company is its earnings sustainability and high level of debt. Edison International has had inconsistent earnings for the last five years, declining sales growth and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 212.81%, making it one of the more risky dividend stocks to hold.Analysts at Guggenheim have also downgraded their recommendation on EIX from a Buy to a Neutral, with a new target price average of $72.V.F. Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comStory continuesV.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a multinational company offering apparel, accessories and footwear. The company has a diverse portfolio of iconic outdoor, lifestyle and workwear brands including Timberland, Dickies and Vans. The company has struggled with declining earnings accruals, cash flow and operating efficiency since 2022. Its revenue for the last three quarters has been in a straight decline. Indeed, its revenue was impacted by a slow recovery in China, higher costs, excess inventories and a declining interest in the brand Vans. In addition, the current inflationary environment is also impacting consumer spending.The company cut its dividend from $0.51 back in December 2022 to $0.31 per share, booting it from the dividend aristocrats list. VFC has been in a continuous downtrend for the last 2 years, making it one of the dividend stocks investors should consider selling.AllianceBernstein Holdings L.P.

The company is known to be one of the leading global investment management firms offering expertise in equities, fixed-income, alternatives and multi-asset strategies.The company has been experiencing a decline in revenue for the last 4 quarters and an EPS decline in double digits. To put it in perspective, according to its latest release, ABs’ EPS year-on-year decline (for the last four quarters relative to its previous year) is -21.9%, -28.09%, -45.74% and -26.67%. In addition, Jeffries analyst Daniel Fannon has also cut its target price for the company from $35.00 to $33.00.Based on its last dividend payment, the company offers an annual dividend yield of 7.85% as of July 2023. However, despite a long history of dividend payments, it’s important to note the company’s payouts have fluctuated over the last few years. Combined with its continuous decline in revenue and EPS, this dying dividend stock is one you should consider selling – especially if you are looking for predictable and consistently growing income in your portfolio.On the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced changes to its executive leadership team to further advance its aspirations to discover and develop new medicines and vaccines, with an emphasis on oncology.Effective today, Chris Boshoff, M.D., PhD, will join Pfizer’s Executive Leadership Team as Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President reporting to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Albert Bourla. Under his leadership, Pfizer will continue to invest in its fight against cancer and Dr. Boshoff will be the single point of accountability for the entire oncology pipeline – from discovery to early and late-phase clinical development.""We are delighted to welcome Chris Boshoff to our executive leadership team as he works to accelerate the delivery of the next generation of cancer breakthroughs to patients around the world,"" said Dr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and CEO, Pfizer Inc. ""About 1 in 3 people will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime in the United States, which means just about every family will be impacted by this dreaded disease. Chris is an exceptional physician-scientist with the vision and expertise to unleash the scale and strength of Pfizer’s ambition in cancer research.""Previously, Dr. Boshoff oversaw clinical research and product development activities for Pfizer’s Oncology portfolio, including 24 approved innovative cancer medicines and biosimilars in more than 30 indications, as well as Pfizer’s industry-leading Rare Disease portfolio of innovative medicines spanning four therapeutic areas. Before assuming leadership roles in the biopharmaceutical industry, Dr. Boshoff served as Director of the University College London (UCL) Cancer Institute. Dr. Boshoff earned his medical degree from University of Pretoria in South Africa, a PhD from the Institute of Cancer Research in London and trained as a medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden and Royal Free Hospitals in London. In addition to his expanded role, Dr Boshoff is leading the integration planning for Seagen’s medicines and team.Story continuesMikael Dolsten, M.D., PhD, currently Chief Scientific Officer &amp; President, Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development and Medical, will now expand his role to lead all discovery, early- and late-stage clinical development, for all non-oncology therapeutic areas as Chief Scientific Officer, President, Pfizer Research &amp; Development. In addition to his current leadership of discovery and early-phase clinical development, he will lead an end-to-end model across all of Pfizer’s other therapeutic areas. These therapeutic areas include Vaccines, Inflammation and Immunology, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases as well as non-malignant hematology and rare neuromuscular diseases.As a result of these moves, William Pao, Chief Development Officer, and Executive Vice President will be leaving Pfizer in the month ahead to pursue new opportunities outside the company. A highly capable and results-oriented leader, William always displayed high integrity and rigorous scientific standards in his work and made significant contributions to the Global Product Development (GPD) organization by bringing strong, data-driven decision-making that always put patients at the center.In March, Pfizer announced its proposed acquisition of Seagen and, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals, the intention is to bring together both organizations to create a leading company in the battle against cancer. Pfizer believes the changes announced today will benefit the company in its current stand-alone structure, and also aligns with Pfizer’s vision for the potentially combined organizations. Pfizer strongly believes the transaction is pro-patient, pro-competitive, and pro-innovation in the battle to defeat cancer. The two companies continue to operate independently until the time of close which is expected in late 2023 or early 2024.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence And The Stock MarketThe stock market has been through a lot in the past few years, what with geopolitical tensions, interest rates and inflation, and a pandemic to boot, all being fast on its tail. Despite these significant challenges, the markets have managed to bounce back in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 having risen by 1.47 points or 0.032%, the Nasdaq Composite rising by 27.49 points or 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average being up by 2.51 points or 0.007%, all on July 24. The success of the markets has largely been based on a larger narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), specifically generative AI and other similar technology. Considering the wide-ranging impact of AI on the markets, investors and finance-minded individuals, in general, are looking at this technology as a way to make the most money they can while they still have the chance.On July 10, CNBC quoted Matt Higgins, a self-made millionaire and the CEO of investment firm RSE Ventures, as commenting that ""AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history."" According to Higgins, this technology has no regard for an individual's background or anything else, giving the global public a chance to try their own hand at making money without any barriers holding them back. Higgins is also not the only person to believe in AI as a money-making technology, as people all across the world are becoming engaged in things like freelancing and entrepreneurship with the help of AI today. At the same time, investors are considering this technology as the turning point in the business journeys of many companies. AI is presenting all sorts of possibilities to a variety of companies today, allowing them to innovate and come up with different products and services that can get them back in demand with consumers and investors alike. This is why many stocks that have remained under the radar for investors for a long time are now beginning to make a name for themselves again.Story continuesHow Are Overlooked Stocks Playing The AI Boom?Many companies, like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), have been using AI to their advantage. These moves have started to garner support for these companies in light of their stellar financial profiles and their efforts to play the AI boom in their favor. Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), for instance, has been using AI to track plants across different weather, soil types, and sun exposure to see the impact of these different conditions on plants for its agricultural operations. The company's latest earnings report from the second quarter also showed that it beat EPS estimates by $1.18 with its $9.65 EPS, while its revenue of $16.08 billion also beat estimates by $1.21 billion. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) has a similar story with a $9.38 EPS in the first quarter beating estimates by $0.18, and revenues of $26.74 billion, also beating estimates by $344.84 million, while the company is also engaged in AI operations.Stocks like these have solid profiles, and their recent ventures in the AI space are making professionals consider them to be some of the best under-the-radar stocks to buy if you're looking to pick up stocks that can play the AI boom. Considering the immense growth potential companies like these seem to have, they may even be considered to be some of the best undervalued stocks to buy now or some of the top undervalued stocks in the S&amp;P 500 overall. Keeping this in mind, we have compiled a list of 11 such stocks below.11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe first picked 25 stocks named by other sources online as some of the top under-the-radar stocks on the market today. We then shortlisted 11 stocks from this list by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, based on which stocks had the most hedge fund investors. They are ranked based on this metric as well, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11۔ Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) is a communication services and broadcasting company based in New York. The company operates through its Cable Network Programming, Television, and Other, Corporate, and Eliminations segments. It offers live news, sports coverage, and entertainment.Analysts today consider Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) a stock with significant underappreciated upside potential. Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, holds an Equal Weight rating on the stock as of June 6. The analyst also has a price target of $36 on the shares.There were 32 hedge funds long Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $422.1 million.10۔ Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34An Overweight rating was maintained on shares of Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) on July 12 by Joshua Pokrzywinski at Morgan Stanley.

The company has a strong brand, installed base and distribution network and is expanding its product offering to include more cloud-based software to complement its leading hardware business. In the coming years, we expect the company to benefit from an acceleration in US manufacturing investment to support customers’ nearshoring initiatives and in response to federal government incentive programs to manufacture energy transition products domestically. In addition, we expect Rockwell to experience revenue and margin tailwinds in 2023 from easing supply chain constraints, which limited its ability to meet customer demand in 2022.”Like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is an overlooked stock that is popular among hedge funds this year.9. Equinix, Inc.

The shares are valued at a small premium to REITs, despite superior and more durable cash-flow growth prospects.”8. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Orbis Investment Management was the most prominent shareholder in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) at the end of the first quarter, holding 7.2 million shares in the company.Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish maintains an Overweight rating on shares of Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

Their total stake value in the company was $2.2 billion.Here's what LVS Advisory said about Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also modestly added to our position in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in the mid-$70s. We initiated our Interactive Brokers position last summer and published a write-up in September 2022. Interactive Brokers continues to trade at a discounted multiple as investors are skeptical that the company will continue to sustain the current level of net interest income beyond the near future. However, recent reports showing strength in the US economy and labor market suggest that interest rates won’t be cut in the near term. The company publishes monthly KPI metrics and investors appear to be ignoring recent strength in trading volume and margin loans. The current market environment of rising stock prices and elevated interest rates is a goldilocks environment for the company. With this last buy, we have now reached our limit of investing 10% of our portfolio at cost in the stock and can no longer increase the holding size.”7. LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is another investment banking and brokerage company on our list. It is based in San Diego, California. The company offers an integrated platform of brokerage and investment advisory services to independent financial advisors and others in the US.Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 52 hedge funds long LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:LPLA) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is the largest independent broker-dealer in the U.S. Following a strong run in 2022, the stock detracted in the quarter. The weakness was largely driven by turmoil in the banking industry after the failure of SVB, which caused investors to sour on financial stocks in general. We believe LPL is immune from most of the issues facing banks. LPL is not a bank itself, has a relatively small balance sheet, and has a low-risk, short-duration securities portfolio. The banking crisis has caused investors to take a more dovish view on the path of interest rates, which is a headwind to LPL’s earnings as the economics on a large portion of client cash is tied to floating rates. However, we believe the company has an attractive growth profile even in a lower interest rate environment.”6. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62A total of 62 hedge funds were long Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.1 billion.Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is a consumer discretionary company operating in the hotels, resorts, and cruise lines industry.

The company offers a wide range of travel shopping and reservation services, as well as provides real-time access to schedule, pricing and availability information for airlines, hotels and car rental companies. Expedia serves customers worldwide.We see Expedia benefiting from the growth of booking travel online, both for leisure and in corporate travel. The company also benefits from rapid growth in alternative accommodations, vacation home rental, through VRBO. The main sources of revenue and profitability are from hotel and vacation home rental. Additionally Expedia has exposure to airline ticket sales and automobile rentals. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, Expedia’s debt has been reduced and share repurchase has resumed and we would expect a dividend to be reinstated.”Like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is an under-the-radar stock that many elite hedge funds have been piling into in 2023.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:10 Overlooked Large-Cap Stocks with Cheap Multiples10 Undervalued Canadian Stocks To Invest In12 Undervalued European Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

It was an opportunity for the couple to see the Summer Olympics in Sydney and a chance for Musk to meet with potential investors for his financial technology startup that was originally called X.com.That’s when he learned that his fellow executives at the company had delivered letters of no confidence about Musk’s leadership to the company’s board. The board removed him as CEO, and the startup went on to become the money-transferring giant PayPal, with a $81.1 billion market cap.It was “one of the nastiest coups in Silicon Valley’s long, illustrious history of nasty coups,” Ashlee Vance wrote in his 2015 Musk biography, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.Musk’s obsession with the letter X has been much discussed since he rebranded Twitter to X on Sunday. The change has been widely criticized and faces legal hurdles over the trademark’s ownership. But this isn’t Musk’s first attempt at overhauling a business and calling it X. He tried the same thing at PayPal, and he failed.Before Twitter, there was PayPalIn 2000, Musk’s X.com merged with its competitor Confinity—creator of PayPal—cofounded by the billionaire Peter Thiel.As CEO of the combined company, Musk had visions of expanding its focus beyond a money-transfer service and wanted to rebrand accordingly. He proposed scrapping the PayPal name and shifting the branding to the letter X.The problem? No one else on the team liked the proposed name, and customers thought that “X.com” sounded like an adult website.These are all porn except one. That one's Twitter. pic.twitter.com/VYUWOFsFTv— Jesse McLaren (@McJesse) July 24, 2023“Musk was unmoved, possibly, employees gossiped, because of sunk costs,” Max Chafkin wrote in his 2021 book titled The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power. “He’d paid at least $1 million to acquire the X.com domain name, legend within the company had it.”Story continuesMusk was ousted from the company in September 2000 and replaced by Thiel. The board explained its decision by blaming Musk’s “lack of a cohesive business model” and “technological issues” too great to overcome, the Washington Post reported.In 2001, the company’s name was changed to PayPal. Sixteen years later, Musk bought the domain X.com back from PayPal for an undisclosed amount.Elon’s second attempt at making ‘X’ happenThe billionaire never gave up on his love for the letter.His other X-related ventures since then include the rocket company SpaceX, artificial intelligence company xAI (intended to rival ChatGPT maker OpenAI), and the Model X at Tesla. He even named his child, born in 2020, with the musician Grimes, X Æ A-Xii, nicknamed X.Musk’s massive overhaul of Twitter is still in progress.He’s teased his intentions of transforming the social media company into an “everything app,” reminiscent of China-based WeChat. He took steps to make it a reality when he applied for a license at the beginning of the year for then-Twitter to facilitate in-app payments and in April merged the platform with a shell company called X Corp, according to legal filings.But Musk has already run into problems with the Twitter name change, one of them being that he doesn’t own the trademark “X.” The limited number of ways to stylize the representation of two intersecting lines makes it one of the most difficult letters to trademark.On Wednesday, he seized the account name—@X—of Gene Hwang, one of his users who’s held the handle since 2007. Hwang “suspected” this would happen eventually, he told NBC News.And by changing Twitter’s name, Musk is reportedly wiping out anywhere between $4 billion to $20 billion in brand value built up by Twitter over the years.Not to mention, users seem to hate the name change, and “X.com,” to many, still sounds like a pornography site.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

To skip our detailed analysis of investing moves today, you can go directly to see the 5 Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love.Investing in stocks will always be a tricky exercise. The market is plagued with high volatility, especially in times of economic crisis with the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and high inflation. Many industries and companies have been feeling the heat turned on by the Fed as a result. In these market conditions, many investors are opting to play it safe rather than be left sorry, as they continue to be wary of stocks and sectors that have either been performing poorly over the past couple of years or those that have the potential to be beaten back in the face of a rapidly transforming market with everchanging trends. At the same time, billionaires and investors in the US are making their own moves as they track the market to pick the best time to cash in their shares and turn a profit.Latest Insider TradesOn July 11, CNBC's Robert Frank reported the latest moves made by top billionaires and CEOs in this market. He noted that during the first half of 2023, about $9 billion worth of shares had been sold by these individuals. They included the Waltons, the family behind Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), who had sold shares of the company worth $4.39 billion year-to-date as of July 11. Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), also cashed in his company's shares worth $893 million year-to-date. Oracle Corporation's (NASDAQ:ORCL) CTO, Larry Ellison, also added another $848 million to his wealth by cashing in the company's shares. Safra Catz, the CEO of Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), also cashed in $470 million by selling her company's shares at a prime moment. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) also saw its CEO selling its shares worth $302 million during the first half of the year. Finally, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) also joined the selling frenzy, making about $210 million with his sale of the company's stock.Story continuesAccording to Frank, this flurry of insider selling has been primarily motivated by questions of valuation. He noted that many of the stocks in question above saw 52-week highs at the start of the year, making this an opportune moment to get out of the trade and make a profit. Yet while the market is seeing many stocks such as these performing at record high levels, there are also many companies whose stocks have been taking a hit during this year. One example is Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), a stock that is down by 8.65% over the past year as of July 14. This stock has been continuing a downward spiral for the past five years, over which period it has fallen by 49.40%. Other well-known stocks that have fallen out of favor over the past few years include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the former being down by 3.54% over the past year and 20.53% over the past five years, while the latter is down by 17.61% over the past five years.What Are Hedge Funds Up To?Many factors are responsible for the worrying performance of these reputable companies, and some would assume that this performance would result in investors and hedge funds alike fleeing their positions in them. However, we have seen over the first quarter that numerous hedge funds have continued to stick by these stocks despite their poor performance, leading one to think twice before they abandon their stakes in these companies. This seems to imply that hedge funds today may be betting on companies such as the one mentioned above in the long run in hopes of making back their money and perhaps even turning a profit at the end of their trade. Considering this, we have compiled a list of 12 stocks that have similarly been performing poorly enough to lose the support of the broader market but have managed to retain the confidence of the hedge funds investing in them. Some may argue that several of these stocks are even some of the best undervalued stocks to buy today or some of the top cheap undervalued stocks on the market.12 Out of Favor Stocks that Hedge Funds LoveOur MethodologyWe first listed down all large-cap stocks that have fallen significantly in value over the past 24 months. From these stocks, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors according to Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

It is based in Ottawa, Canada.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP): Shopify shares were a top contributor in the quarter as the market focused on the company’s recent price increases and its ongoing market share gains in e-commerce gross merchandise volumes (GMV). Earlier in the quarter the company reported better-than-expected 4Q results, with 26% revenue growth and $248 million of FCF (at a 14% margin), significantly better than the Street consensus of -$109 million.Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels. We believe that the overall growth of e-commerce, combined with the development of new products and services, such as its digital wallet Shop Pay and its pick, pack and ship Shopify Fulfillment Network, should continue to drive revenue growth of about 20% per year over the next several years, accompanied by re-acceleration of operating margin growth and FCF generation.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a stock that has managed to retain its popularity with hedge funds despite its recent performance.10. Pinterest, Inc.

(NYSE:FIS) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio holdings most directly impacted by the bank failures of the first quarter were Charles Schwab and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), both top detractors for the quarter. Banking software provider FIS’s shares were also collateral damage as investors looked to shed any exposure to the small and regional banks that FIS serves. This, after several quarters of underwhelming operating results, lands FIS as our top detractor for the fiscal year period as well. Our FIS experience has been disappointing to be sure. But having re-underwritten our investment thesis and lowered our business value estimate, we believe investors have exacted too steep a penalty on FIS shares. From this lowered price, we are optimistic that new management can reestablish credibility with investors and unlock value through the planned separation of the banking software and merchant services businesses.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a stock that many elite hedge funds are piling into this year.7.

Click to skip our detailed analysis of the state of the chatbot market today and jump right to the 10 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots.If you’re looking for some good excuses to get out of work for a week, or even just a day, and your human brain just can’t come up with anything that isn’t totally lame or cliche, perhaps AI is the answer.AI chatbots have exploded into the public consciousness in the last year, driven by the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The renowned chatbot had more than 100 million active users within just two months of its launch and garnered 1.6 billion visits in June 2023 alone. The platform generates well-articulated and informative responses to just about any question posed to it, including believable sick day excuses. We have even used the platform to compile a list of ChatGPT’s top stock picks.Given its controversial ability to generate everything from fake excuses to get out of work (as we’ll see below), to full-blown essays, to staggering misinformation, ChatGPT has been banned by several countries, including Italy, though that particular ban over privacy concerns has since been lifted.While ChatGPT has attracted the lion’s share of public interest, it’s far from the only chatbot. Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN)’s Zendesk Bots, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)’s Einstein, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s Watson Assistant, HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS)’s Chatbot Builder, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Bard, and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Bing Chat are just a few of the other chatbots on the market.Until now, the broader chatbot industry has largely been devoted to customer service applications, allowing websites to handle service requests, inquiries, and sales through an automated platform. The industry is still relatively small in size, at an estimated $5.13 billion in 2022 according to Grand View Research, but it’s expected to grow at an impressive 24% CAGR between 2023 and 2030. Social media chatbots are expected to be a strong growth driver for the industry, with their CAGR projected to be on par with the overall growth of the industry.Story continuesZendesk’s Customer Service BotsZendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN) Bots offers both standard and advanced bots to the company’s customers for implementation into their websites. The company’s advanced bots use AI to accurately recognize support requests and forward them to the proper channels. They also come with pre-trained understanding of customer intents in several industries, including financial services, software, and retail. Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN) was acquired by a group of private equity firms in June 2022 for $10.2 billion after previously turning down a $17 billion takeover offer.Salesforce’s Generative AI for CRMSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)’s Einstein GPT is billed by the company as the world’s first generative AI for CRM applications. The AI platform can generate emails and conversations based on real-time insights culled from customers’ business data, boosting sales and improving the customer experience. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)’s leading AI ecosystem, which also includes Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, helped the company grow revenue by 11% year-over-year to $8.25 billion in the quarter ended April 30. Free cash flow surged by 21% to $4.25 billion.IBM’s Business-Focused AI AssistantInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s Watson Assistant uses deep learning and machine learning in combination with a natural language processing model that allows it to interact with customers in a conversational tone and accurately understand context and intent. The model also has an intelligent search function that can quickly scan documents and websites for the most concise and relevant answers. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s software revenue grew by 7.5% year-over-year during the company’s Q3 2023 period, hitting $5.81 billion and widely topping analysts’ estimates.HubSpot’s Free AI Chatpot ToolsHubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS)’s Chatbot Builder allows customers to choose from a range of chatbot templates or customize their own bot with features like meeting scheduling, leads qualifying, and task automation. The chatbots are fully integrated with HubSpot’s free CRM software, which includes additional features like analytics and email marketing, allowing the bots to be customized with personalized messages that pull information from an information database. HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) grew its first quarter earnings by 122% year-over-year to $1.20, while revenue jumped by 27% to $502 million. HubSpot Chief Executive Yamini Rangan believes generative AI is leading to a massive transformational shift in the market and that the company is well positioned to help customers optimize their operations through AI.Bard Building on Years of Alphabet’s AI ResearchAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Bard is a generative AI chatbot in the vein of ChatGPT that uses a large language model to deliver conversational responses regarding everything from the latest developments surrounding the James Webb Space Telescope to 10 really unusual sick day excuses. Bard is not yet widely available or as popular as ChatGPT. Alphabet has been using AI for years to improve Google’s understanding of language and what the key aspects of a specific search question are so the engine can deliver the most relevant results. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) pulled in $62 billion in revenue in Q2 driven by growth in Search revenue, which has thus far withstood the challenge of AI chatbots.Microsoft’s Browser-Based AI ChatbotMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Bing Chat is another AI chatbot that will be competing with ChatGPT and Bard. Bing Chat has numerous intriguing features that are either already implemented, or are in development. One of them is the chatbot’s ability to summarize long form online content into concise explanations. Another is the ability to compare various products, with the bot even utilizing tables to summarize the pertinent information of each product.The Ithaka Group is bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s position in the generative AI market, having this to say about the company in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds best-in-class platforms and provides services that help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft’s stock appreciated on the back of excitement surrounding the company’s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI.”AI chatbots have rapidly become a great source of random information, providing everything from a list of reasons for leave of absence from work to the most plausible family emergency excuses, and their capabilities are only scratching the surface of what they could eventually become, which has investors and consumers alike excited for the future of chatbots.For now, let’s go ahead and check out the best excuses to get out of work as generated by the current iterations of two specific AI chatbots.Our MethodologyThe 30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots are ranked subjectively based on their plausibility and how applicable they are to the masses.The lists provided by two different AI chatbots were used to compile the ranking, Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and each listing notes which chatbot came up with the idea. In cases where both chatbots had the same idea, we used the one that offered the better supporting reasoning and ways to implement the excuse. The chatbot that came up with the most quality excuses will be crowned the winner at the end of the article.Note that Microsoft’s Bing Chat was also consulted but refused to provide any excuses, making it the least fun chatbot of the three. On with the excuses!30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots30. Religious holiday. If you celebrate a religious holiday that falls on a workday, you may need to take a day off work. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, and your boss should be understanding.Chat Bot: Bard This is a rather weak suggestion, as there would actually have to be a religious holiday taking place on the day in question for this excuse to have any merit, and there are relatively few of those on the calendar.29. Need to buy urgent medication. If you need to buy urgent medication, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention what the medication is for and how long it will take to get it.Chat Bot: Bard If you’re looking for one of the best excuses to get out of work for the day, this probably isn’t it. It would be hard to justify needing an entire day off simply to go buy medication.28. Public Transportation Issues: ""There's a major disruption in public transportation, and I won't be able to reach work on time.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This is a poor excuse for multiple reasons. There would have to be a known issue with local public transportation (such as a workers’ strike) for this to fly, and even then, there are potentially several workarounds (other unaffected transportation options) that should still be able to get you to work.27. Severe Weather: ""Due to inclement weather conditions, it's unsafe for me to commute to work.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This is another excuse that has extremely limited viability, as the weather would actually have to be quite extreme in your area for this to have any merit.26. Legal Obligation: ""I have to appear in court for a legal matter.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This isn’t a terrible excuse on the surface, but it does run the risk of your employer asking into the nature of the legal matter, which they may even be required to do if such a matter is brought to their attention. As such, this excuse is probably too risky to use.25. Interview. If you have a job interview, you may need to take a day off work to attend the interview. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, and your boss should be understanding.Chat Bot: Bard This is another excuse that isn’t terrible in a vacuum, but it would cause your employer to question your loyalty if they believe you to be out looking for other work. If you actually like your job and do intend to keep it for the foreseeable future, you probably don’t want your employer thinking otherwise.24. Travel delays. If your flight or train is delayed, you may need to miss work. You can say that your flight was cancelled, that your train was delayed, or that you're stuck in traffic.Chat Bot: Bard Not one of the best excuses to get out of work as far as a train being delayed or being stuck in traffic goes. Unless you’re claiming the train is delayed by hours or that you’re stuck in the traffic jam of the century, those excuses aren’t going to buy you a day off work. A flight cancellation has more merit if you travel a lot for work, but isn’t going to be viable for the average worker.23. Pregnant sickness. If you're pregnant and experiencing morning sickness or other pregnancy-related nausea, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention how severe the nausea is and how long it's been going on.Chat Bot: Bard If you’re actually a biological female and pregnant, then this is undoubtedly one of the best excuses to get out of work. If you’re neither of those things, which probably applies to 98-99% of the population, then it’s rather useless.22. Volunteer work. If you volunteer for a cause that you care about, you may need to take a day off work to volunteer. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, and your boss should be understanding.Chat Bot: Bard I wouldn’t be so sure about the boss being understanding. Your employer may appreciate that you do volunteer work, but not when it’s conflicting with your non-volunteer, I’m-paying-you-to-be-here work.21. Training. If you need to attend training, you may need to take a day off work. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, but you'll need to make sure that you're able to make up the work.Chat Bot: Bard This could be an alright excuse in the right scenario, depending on what kind of work you do and whether training or certification courses could add valuable new skills to your repertoire. The downside is, your employer would probably want to know the specifics of the training as far as how it relates to your job, and then might expect you to add those tasks to your workload.20. Deadlines. If you have a deadline that you need to meet, you may need to take a day off work to work on it. This is a legitimate reason for missing work, but you'll need to make sure that you're able to meet the deadline.Chat Bot: Bard Decent excuse in the right scenario, though it could also make your employer question your job performance if you’re claiming to be well behind on a project you perhaps shouldn’t be so far behind on.19. Jury Duty: ""I've been summoned for jury duty and have to report to the courthouse.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT It some ways it sounds like one of the most crazy and yet cliché excuses ever, but hey, it’s actually plausible if you live in an area where jury duty is a legal requirement.18. Personal Counseling or Therapy: ""I have a scheduled counseling/therapy session that I can't miss.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This isn’t a bad excuse, whether it would justify a full day off work is the primary question. If you claim the appointment is smack dab in the middle of the day, leaving you only a couple hours to come in on either side of it, it could work.17. Last-minute appointment. If you have a last-minute appointment that you can't reschedule, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention what the appointment is for and how long it will take.Chat Bot: Bard As far as good excuses to get out of things last minute goes, this is one of the safest bets. Your employer may ask for the details and whether or not you can make it in at any point during the day however.16. Muscle problems. If you have muscle problems, such as a pulled muscle or a sprain, you can use this as an excuse to miss work. Be sure to mention what happened and how long you need to rest.Chat Bot: Bard This is a pretty solid excuse in that it could be applied to many jobs and probably isn’t going to require any kind of doctor’s note to justify.15. Car problems. If your car breaks down, you may need to miss work to get it fixed. You can say that your car broke down on the way to work, that you had to get it towed, or that you're waiting for a part to be delivered.Chat Bot: Bard Car problems is a relatively standard excuse, but not one of the best excuses to get out of work for the day, as it doesn’t necessarily explain why you can’t still get in to work via public transportation.14. Sleepless Night: ""I had a sleepless night due to unforeseen circumstances and need to rest.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT If you just need sick leave reasons for 1 day, this is a good excuse in the sense that there’s no way to disprove it. Whether or not your employer thinks you should just tough it out and work on little to no sleep anyway is another matter.13. Technology Malfunction: ""My computer crashed, and I won't be able to work remotely.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT This is one of best excuses to get out of work if you’re a remote worker and pretty much the standard go-to excuse. However, given the rising work capabilities of smartphones, it’s becoming harder to justify taking a day off work on the basis that your laptop or PC isn’t operational.12. Car Accident: ""I was involved in a minor car accident, and I need to handle the insurance process.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT A decent excuse, though the insurance process doesn’t take very long and the accident would have to have occurred before your shift (on the way to work presumably), potentially leaving plenty of time to still come in to work. You could ask for the day off on the basis of having to also take the car in to a shop to be looked at and/or yourself to a clinic to be examined.11. Moving or Relocation: ""I'm moving to a new residence and need to take care of moving-related tasks.""Chat Bot: ChatGPT Claiming you have a moving day is a decent excuse to get out of work, unless your work has to mail you stuff, in which case it would cause issues. In the second half of this article we’ll check out the ten best excuses to get out of work according to AI and declare which AI chatbot offered better slacker suggestions. Click to continue reading and see the 10 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Free iPhone and iPad Games10 Best Cocktails for People Who Don’t Like Taste of Alcohol35 Best Drama Movies on NetflixDisclosure: None. 30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Now generally available, the IBM Cloud Carbon Calculator – an AI-informed dashboard – can help clients access emissions data across a variety of IBM Cloud workloads such as AI, high performance computing (HPC) and financial services.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)Across industries, enterprises are embracing modernization by leveraging hybrid cloud and AI to digitally transform with resiliency, performance, security, and compliance at the forefront, all while remaining focused on delivering value and driving more sustainable business practices. According to a recent study by IBM, 42% of CEOs surveyed pinpoint environmental sustainability as their top challenge over the next three years1. At the same time, the study reports that CEOs are facing pressure to adopt generative AI while also weighing the data management needs to make AI successful. The increase in data processing required for AI workloads can present new challenges for organizations that are looking to reduce their GHG emissions. With more than 43% of CEOs surveyed already using generative AI to inform strategic decisions, organizations should prepare to balance executing high performance workloads with sustainability.To help clients respond to these challenges, the IBM Cloud Carbon Calculator is designed to quickly spot patterns, anomalies and outliers in data that are potentially associated with higher GHG emissions. Based on technology from IBM Research and through a collaboration with Intel, the tool uses machine learning and advanced algorithms to help organizations uncover emissions hot spots in their IT workload and provide them with insights to inform their emissions mitigation strategy2.Story continues""As part of any AI transformation roadmap, businesses must consider how to manage the growth of data across cloud and on-premise environments. This is especially critical today as we see organizations face increasing pressure from investors, regulators, and clients to reduce their carbon emissions,"" said Alan Peacock, General Manager, IBM Cloud. ""For IBM, reducing environmental impact to help create a more sustainable future is a top priority and we are committed to helping clients achieve both sustainability and business goals.

280,c3567e3d-3edd-33bd-8472-292cc0d7100b,MPC,2023-07-27,Murphy USA (MUSA) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/murphy-usa-musa-expected-beat-140226382.html,1690380146,STORY,"['MUSA', 'MPC']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Murphy USA (MUSA) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis gasoline station operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.9%.Revenues are expected to be $5.59 billion, down 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.98% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Murphy USA?For Murphy USA, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Murphy USA will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Murphy USA would post earnings of $4.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.80, delivering a surprise of +18.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Murphy USA appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is soon expected to post earnings of $4.55 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -57.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $31.02 billion, down 42.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Marathon Petroleum has been revised 5.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.17%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $4.56 per share on revenues of $31 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent oil refiner and marketer’s results in the June quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at MPC’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q1 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last-reported quarter, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator handily beat the consensus mark on stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. MPC had reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.09, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74. Revenues of $35.1 billion generated by the firm also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%.Marathon Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 14.2%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line has been revised 2.6% downward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 57% deterioration year over year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a 42.8% decrease from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderA drop in refining margins is expected to have weighed on Marathon Petroleum’s second-quarter 2023 results on a year-over-year basis. With the metric normalizing from last-year’s spectacular highs, the key contributor to MPC’s earnings — its Refining &amp; Marketing division — is likely to have borne the brunt. Our estimate for the segment’s margin is $17.98 per barrel, implying a contraction of 52.1% from the corresponding period of 2022.Our forecast also indicates a decrease in capacity utilization and throughput. Our estimate for second-quarter capacity utilization is pegged at 91.3%, suggesting a decline from the 100% achieved a year ago. Meanwhile, net refinery throughput is predicted at 2,860 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), implying a 6.8% year-over-year drop.Consequently, our estimate for Marathon Petroleum’s Refining &amp; Marketing segment operating income is pegged at $2.8 billion, suggesting a plunge from the prior-year quarter’s profit of $7.1 billion.On a further bearish note, the increase in Marathon Petroleum’s costs might have dented its to-be-reported bottom line. Our estimate for refining operating costs per barrel is pegged at $5.20, indicating a marginal increase from $5.19 reported in the year-ago quarter. The upward cost trajectory could be attributed to the ongoing inflationary environment and tight labor market.Offering some respite amid all the negative factors is a marginal improvement in product sales volumes. Going by our model, the second-quarter average refined product sales are pegged at 3,630.2 mbpd compared to 3,615 mbpd in the year-ago period.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat estimates in the second quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company is -0.15%.Zacks Rank: MPC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:TC Energy Corporation TRP has an Earnings ESP of +4.66% and a Zacks Rank #2.

285,7d00aae8-a431-3bd6-ace7-4c624dc466f6,WAT,2023-07-27,Analysts Estimate Waters (WAT) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-waters-wat-report-140216734.html,1690380136,STORY,['WAT'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Waters (WAT) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of products used in drug discovery and development is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.8%.Revenues are expected to be $733.51 million, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waters?For Waters, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.60%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waters will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Waters would post earnings of $2.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.49, delivering a surprise of -4.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Waters doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Wall Street Journal reported that the automakers collectively intend to spend at least $1 billion to fund the joint venture.Most interestingly, the group says the new network will allow any battery-powered electric vehicles from any automaker, as long as the vehicle uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) or Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). It is unclear yet whether the charging stations will natively support Tesla's NACS standard or require the use of an adapter.Two of the automakers — GM and Mercedes — currently have partnership deals with Tesla to incorporate the NACS plug in their North American vehicles in 2025 and to have access to the Supercharger network next year. Hyundai and its sister brand Kia have been rumored to be discussing a similar deal with Tesla.A Tesla Supercharger station is seen in Dietikon, Switzerland October 21, 2020.

""By working with companies across the industry to accelerate the deployment of charging infrastructure, we can continue to expand access across residential, workplace, and public charging.

Mercedes also intends to build its own bespoke network of chargers with 3,000 high-power DC chargers coming to North America.Unlike traditional charging station destinations operated by networks like ChargePoint, EVgo, or Electrify America, the automakers say their network will include multiple high-power DC chargers at each location, offer amenities like food service and restrooms, and be powered solely by renewable energy. Initial stations will be located near major metropolitan areas, and later along highways and travel corridors.The joint venture is expected to be established later this year, with the deal closing subject to regulatory approval, the automakers said.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Never miss another market-moving headline.Target stock falls on Raymond James downgradeTarget (NYSE:TGT) was downgraded by Raymond James to Market Perform from Outperform, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.The analyst believes the retailer is losing momentum in its revenue numbers, and also voiced concerns about macro trends:Our change in opinion reflects our belief that [quarter-to-date] sales &amp; traffic trends... have remained soft after taking a step down early in the quarter and suggest Target is losing topline momentum. In addition, we have seen further indications that overall consumer discretionary spending (more important for TGT’s mix of products) was weak during F2Q— creating greater potential for a higher promotional environment and consumables mix and ultimately delaying Target’s margin recovery story (key part of our prior thesis).Earlier this month, TD Cowen cut its price target on the company to $166 from $200, noting that risks for the retailer may persist as the consumer shift is driving the downside. And last month, the company was downgraded by Citi, KeyBanc, and JPMorgan as well.Target is set to report its Q2/24 earnings on Aug 16. Street estimates stand at $1.58 for EPS and $25.62 billion for revenues.Shares lost ground in premarket trading, but were recently ticking up fractionally at $133.75 in the regular session.Goldman Sachs cut to Neutral at CitiGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) shares fell more than 1% yesterday after Citi downgraded the company to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $400.00 (from $370.00), noting that the valuation is ahead of itself.At its recent analyst day, the management set a target of 15-17% ROTCE and introduced several KPIs to monitor their progress. According to Citi, last week’s Q2 earnings results showed continued advancement in meeting these KPIs, even though the adjusted return was a moderate 9%.Story continuesWhile we view the ROTCE target as achievable, we also believe it will take time as well as a better investment banking environment where GS is very levered to in GBM (investment banking highest return business) and AWM (via higher incentive fees/harvesting of gains on its on-balance sheet investments).2 more downgrades DZ Bank downgraded American Express (NYSE:AXP) from Buy to Hold with a price target of $180.00 following last week’s Q2 results, highlighted by an EPS beat but lower-than-expected revenues. This represents the second downgrade for American Express this week.BofA Securities downgraded Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $226.00 from $270.00 ahead of the company’s Q2 earnings announcement tomorrow.We expect TSCO to report an earnings miss and cut guidance given a fading tailwind from inflation and worsening demand for discretionary categories.Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

This figure compares with our model’s projection of $2.18 billion for the second quarter.COVID-19 Testing revenues nosedived 88.3% in the second quarter to $41 million. However, the figure still exceeded our model’s projected revenues of $22.9 million from this segment in the second quarter of 2023.Diagnostic Information Services revenues in the quarter were down 4.9% on a year-over-year basis to $2.27 billion. This figure compares with our model’s projection of $2.13 billion for the second quarter.Volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) were up 0.2% year over year in the second quarter. Revenue per requisition declined 4.9% year over year.MarginsThe cost of services during the reported quarter was $1.55 billion, down 4% year over year. The gross profit declined 5.9% to $792 million. The gross margin was 33.9%, reflecting a 45-basis point (bps) contraction from the year-ago figure.SG&amp;A expenses fell 1.4% to $416 million in the quarter under review. The adjusted operating margin of 16.1% represented a 104-bps contraction year over year.Story continuesCash, Capital Structure and SolvencyQuest Diagnostics exited the second quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $126 million compared with $315 million at the end of 2022.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $8.67.Our TakeQuest Diagnostics reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2023. Strength demonstrated in the base business is encouraging, reflecting the company’s ongoing efforts to partner with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid a continued return to care.The company noted the substantial progress made toward improving the profitability of the base business compared to the first quarter and the prior year, which bodes well. DGX’s updated outlook for the full year boosts optimism while operating in a tight labor market.Meanwhile, year-over-year declines in the top line and earnings are worrisome.

304,46ed0673-a78d-3219-b3ed-c0a7726b3db5,BXP,2023-07-27,Boston Properties (BXP) to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-properties-bxp-post-q2-115800641.html,1690372680,STORY,"['BXP', 'AMT']","[Boston Properties, Inc. BXP is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, after market close. While its quarterly results are likely to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, funds from operations (FFO) per share might exhibit a decline.In the last reported quarter, this office real-estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.76% in terms of FFO per share. BXP’s quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues on healthy leasing activity.Over the preceding four quarters, Boston Properties’ FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 2.46%. This is depicted in the graph below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Properties, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPer a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, the overall recovery in the U.S. office market demand remains choppy, with recession fears lingering amongst occupiers. The pace of job growth has been slower than in early 2022, and the rate of deceleration for office-using employment is higher. Amid this, the second quarter recorded a negative net absorption of 26.9 million square feet (msf), marking the lowest quarter in two years.The overall gross leasing activity for the four quarters ended second-quarter 2023 was 289 msf. Further, leasing activity in the quarter slumped 24% year over year. While leasing slid for four straight quarters, it was still 49 msf (20%) above the pandemic-era low witnessed in the first quarter of 2021.Also, the greater availability of sublease space (2.9% of the total inventory, almost three times the pre-pandemic norm of around 1%) is a key concern for this sector’s recovery. The second-quarter national vacancy rate rose 70 basis points to 19.2%, reflecting the largest quarter-over-quarter increase since mid-2021. The national asking rent was $37.34 for the quarter.   Nonetheless, the Cushman &amp; Wakefield report highlights that demand for select premium office spaces continues to outperform the broader market, with 21 of the 92 U.S. markets tracked by the company reporting positive net absorption in the second quarter.As for Boston Properties, its portfolio of modern, class A office buildings is expected to have benefited from the growing preference for premier office buildings by tenants, aiding leasing activity and occupancy growth.The company’s long-term lease agreements with a diverse, creditworthy tenant base across industries are likely to have helped generate stable cashflows during the to-be-reported quarter, boosting the top line.Also, given that the demand for life-science assets is booming on the back of drug research and innovation, BXP’s life-science assets are anticipated to have witnessed robust demand during the second quarter. In addition, the company’s efforts to convert numerous straight office buildings to laboratory/life science spaces in its suburban portfolio on this growing demand are likely to have given it an edge.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $752.8 million, suggesting growth of 4.3% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. However, the consensus estimate for quarterly parking and other revenues is pegged at $25.15 million, implying a 4.9% fall from the year-ago period’s reported number of $26.47 million.We expect Boston Properties to have continued with its development and redevelopment activities in the second quarter, aiding net operating income growth. Further, its solid balance sheet position is likely to have supported its development pipeline as well.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised marginally northward to $1.80 over the past two months. The figure, however, suggests a fall of 7.2% from the prior-year period’s reported number.A choppy office real estate market scenario, rising supply of office properties in some markets where the company operates and high interest expenses might have impaired BXP’s quarterly performance to some extent. We estimate interest expense to rise 22.1% year over year in the quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an FFO beat for Boston Properties this time. The right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Boston Properties has an Earnings ESP of -0.36%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Boston Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Welcome to the Navient Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jen Earyes, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jen EaryesThank you, Shannon. Hello, good morning, and welcome to Navient's earnings call for the second quarter of 2023. With me today are Dave Yowan, Navient CEO; and Joe Fisher, Navient CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. You can view and download presentation slides, including slides you may find useful during this call, on Navient.com/investors.But before we begin, keep in mind our discussion will contain predictions, expectations, forward-looking statements and other information about our business that is based on management's current expectations as of the date of this presentation. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. This could be due to a variety of factors. Listeners should refer to the discussion of those factors on the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.During this conference call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including core earnings, adjusted tangible equity ratio and other various non-GAAP financial measures that are also derived from core earnings. Our GAAP results and description of our non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the second quarter 2023 supplemental earnings disclosure, which is also posted on Navient.com/investors. You will find more information about these measures beginning on Page 18 of Navient's second quarter 2023 earnings release. There is also a full reconciliation of core earnings to GAAP included in the disclosure.Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Dave.Story continuesDavid L. YowanThanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call and for your interest in Navient. I want to begin with thanks to my new colleagues, Team Navient, for the open and warm welcome they've provided me since I assumed this role. As most of you know, about halfway through the second quarter, I transitioned from a member of Navient's Board of Directors to the role of Navient CEO. And with little more than 10 weeks under my belt, I can share that many of the views I held about Navient as a board member have been reaffirmed. Mainly, I found a strong foundation of assets and capabilities and a talented group of people. I'd also become more familiar with the great work well underway to simplify the business, reduce risk and improve efficiency. These activities remain full steam ahead.On today's call, I plan to spend some time sharing my perspectives on Navient, specifically where and why I see value in the company today and our future potential. And I also want to share with you some information on the work we are undertaking to deliver more of that value to our shareholders. As we communicated when I was appointed in May, the Board and I shared our view that it was the right time to explore and consider change. As such, I'm currently undertaking an in-depth and holistic review of our business with the goal of identifying a range of alternative opportunities to deliver greater value to our shareholders. The Board and I have a sense of urgency around this review, but also intend to be comprehensive in our analysis and thoughtful about any decisions and actions we may take. At this early point in this journey, it's too soon to report any observations or sense of direction from the review. I look forward to keeping you informed as we move through the process.Turning now to my current views of the business. Let me start with Slide 2. As a quick refresher, for those who might be newer to the organization, Navient is organized around 3 business segments: the Federal Education Loan segment; the Consumer Lending segment; and the Business Processing segment. The vast majority of revenue and margin in our Federal segment comes from our portfolio of FFELP loans. Our Consumer Lending segment's primary source of revenue and margin is from our private loan portfolio. That portfolio consists of 2 distinct parts. One includes refi and in-school loans originated by Navient in the past several years. The second consists of seasoned loans, the vast majority of which were orientated prior to Navient's creation in 2014. And the third business segment, our Business Processing segment, includes businesses that provide a variety of services for state, local and federal government entities, as well as revenue cycle management and other services to healthcare providers.Our strategy is underpinned by the 4 imperatives you see on Slide 3: maximize the cash flows from our loan portfolio; enhance the value of our growth businesses; maintain a strong balance sheet and distribute excess capital; and continuously simplify the business and increase efficiency. While executing these imperatives, we continue to help customers meet their financial needs, continuously strengthen our control environment and be good citizens in the communities in which we operate.Now to provide an overview of our FFELP portfolio. There are substantial cash flows we project to receive over the next few years. As a reminder, these are cash flow forecasts after the related secured facilities are paid. On the right-hand side of Slide 4, you'll see the key assumptions used to make these projections. On Slide 5, you'll see the even more substantial cash flows we project to receive from our current consumer lending private education loan portfolio over the next few years. To be clear, this is a snapshot of the projected cash flows from our existing portfolio. They do not include additional cash flows from future loan originations. These are projected on the same basis as FFELP cash flows. Loan cash inflows, net of secured financing outflows.We've provided the cash flow projections like those on Slides 4 and 5 in our investor presentation for several years now. We plan to continue to provide these estimates, which will include any new net cash flows from loans we bring onto our balance sheet each quarter. In fact, Slide 6 reminds you of the refi and in-school loan originations over the last several years, along with our target for full year 2023 originations. As you know, the addressable market for refi loans has declined in the current higher rate environment. The peak in-school origination period occurs during the third quarter of the year as students begin their fall semesters, a cycle unique from those of other consumer finance products.Let me now turn to Slide 7. At the foundation of these businesses is a mission to support and build the financial futures of our customers. Helping borrowers manage their loans is an essential part of that. Customers report being highly satisfied with the simple and clear experience they have with our Earnest brand. In fact, Earnest is routinely recognized as a top student loan lender by sites such as U.S. News, NerdWallet and has some of the highest ratings in the industry according to Trustpilot Reviews. These accolades are testament to our customer-focused team. Earnest supports students in their financial journey in other ways as well. Going Merry by Earnest offers digital tools to a growing number of students that help them identify, understand and navigate grants and scholarships.Slide 8 combines the substantial cash flows from our 2 loan segments and provides some insights into what we are focused on in these portfolios. As you can see, the projections show that our portfolios will produce cash flows just shy of $1.5 billion ballpark each of the next 5 years -- each of the next years. We also have a proven record in effectively managing net interest rate, funding and the credit elements of these loan portfolios.Our net interest margin, or NIM, has been relatively resilient to variations in the interest rate environment. As one proof point, Slide 9 shows the NIM on the 2 portfolios since Q4 of 2019. This period includes a full fed rate cycle from interest rates being cut by the Fed at the onset of the pandemic to interest rate increases at incredible speeds as inflationary pressures emerged during the pandemic recovery period. Even with a 500 basis point range on the fed funds rate, the NIM on both of these portfolios remained relatively stable and in a relatively narrow range.Slides 10 and 11 shows credit performance as measured by net charge-offs and our loan loss allowance coverage against these 2 portfolios over the same 4-plus year time period, starting pre-pandemic Q4 2019. Specifically, Slide 10 shows how FFELP allowance coverage has remained relatively stable over this period. As you know, the federal government guarantees 97% or more of principal and interest on these levels. The allowance as a percent of outstanding balances reflects the federal guarantee on all but 3% of principal and interest.Net charge-offs in this portfolio over this period, a period which included pandemic forbearance and other borrower relief programs, remained low and actually declined. As borrowers have exited those programs, net charge-offs have, as expected, increased. We attribute this increase to be a catch-up of charge-offs that would have otherwise occurred during the period of the pandemic. We expect charge-off levels to return to historical levels as this catch-up cycle runs its course, absent changes in macroeconomic variables. The net charge-off trends in the consumer lending portfolio reflect similar dynamics as FFELP: decreasing charge-offs while pandemic borrower relief programs were in place, and increases as expected as borrowers exited the pandemic relief programs.Loan loss allowance coverage levels here are explained primarily by the changing mix of the portfolio over time. Our refi loan originations were substantial during the low rate environment. They represent a significant and growing percent of the total portfolio. Because of the lower risk profile and its demonstrated credit performance, the allowance held against refi loans is lower than the allowance held against seasoned or in-school loans. This trend has lowered the loan loss allowance as a percent of loans outstanding.Using the trust performance of Navient-sponsored FFELP-backed securities, FFELP ABS, you can gain a sense of the prepayments occurring on our FFELP portfolio over the same period. As you can see on Slide 12, there was an increase in prepayment rates during the second half of last year. This prepayment increase was driven in large part by FFELP borrowers who consolidated into federal direct loans in the expectation that they might participate in the administration's debt reduction proposals. You can see that prepayment activity has declined and stabilized in the first half of this year. Future prepayment levels remain uncertain under the administration's recently announced actions and proposals on reducing student debt.There's been a lot of talk in the news about federal direct student loan payments resuming this fall. Slide 13 shows that the vast majority of our consumer lending portfolio is in active repayment. The resumption of student loan payments you hear about in the news relates only to loans owned by the U.S. government, not our portfolios. Within our portfolios, the percentage of borrowers in repayment declined at the outset of the pandemic as borrowers entered relief programs that we offered at that time. For most borrowers, those programs ended in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, over 95% of this portfolio is currently in repayment status.Now for our third business segment. Slide 14 gives an overview of the broad array of services and diversified customer segments served in our Business Processing Solutions division. We serve over 500 government and healthcare clients and touch tens of millions of people in this business. Slide 15 shows revenue on our Business Processing segment over the last 3 years. You can see that total revenue rose significantly as we took on a variety of pandemic-related services and then decreased as those contracts were phased out as the pandemic came to an end. Normalizing for that revenue, you can see that our revenue from traditional, that is, non-pandemic contracts, has grown strongly and steadily over this period, thanks to the good work of the BPS team. In fact, we were recently awarded our largest ever contract in this segment, and revenues from it and other contracts project revenue growth again this year.I want to take this moment to reiterate our longstanding capital allocation framework, as you can see on Slide 16. We are committed to a strong balance sheet through which we retain the flexibility to support business growth as well as to respond to unexpected adverse economic environments and are also committed to returning excess capital to shareholders.Slide 17 provides some additional color on our strategic imperatives. I've covered many of the items on this page. There are a couple additional things I want to mention here. One is how I think about what may be described as the free cash flows from our loan portfolios. The cash flow projections we showed on earlier slides are before we consider the cash flows from consolidated expenses. These include unsecured debt expenses and repayments and all operating expenses, such as loan servicing expenses, corporate function expenses and taxes, among others.Navient has experienced substantial changes in its business footprint. For example, Business Processing Solutions was created largely through acquisitions immediately after Navient began in 2014. We originated refi loans starting in 2017 with the acquisition of our Earnest subsidiary. We decided to exit the Department of Education loan servicing contract and transferred it in 2021. These changes and others represented significant changes in the scale and scope of our business operations.In conducting the in-depth review and in focusing on simplicity and efficiency, we want to ensure that the scale of our operations is aligned appropriately with the scale of our current and future business needs. In addition, where appropriate and when possible, we will seek to make our expense base more variable, which provides more operating and financial flexibility. These strategic imperatives around maximizing loan cash flows and simplicity and efficiency are designed to increase the free cash flows that are available to enhance the value of our growth businesses and return capital to shareholders. We will keep you apprised as we identify, with a sense of urgency, additional ways to increase these cash flows and as we make decisions on how to best deploy them.With that, I will turn it over to Joe for a review of this quarter's results, and I look forward to your questions later in the call.Joe FisherThank you, Dave, and thank you to everyone on today's call for your interest in Navient. During my prepared remarks, I will review the second quarter results for 2023 and provide updated guidance for the remainder of the year.First, I would like to note that we will no longer be providing the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted core earnings per share. Our full year 2023 earnings per share guidance will now include our expectations for regulatory and restructuring expenses. We believe this will make it easier to follow our reported earnings and provide for greater consistency in our coverage estimates. In addition, we've made formatting changes to our earnings presentation. To the extent information no longer appears in this presentation, you may still find it published in the full range of materials we provide, including the 10-Q.Turning to results. Our year-to-date reported core earnings per share was $1.73 through the second quarter, and we are updating our full year guidance to a range of $3.15 to $3.30 core earnings per share. The updated positive guidance now includes expenses of $22 million, or $0.13, related to regulatory and restructuring expense that occurred through the first 6 months, along with our expected ongoing regulatory expense for the rest of 2023.The second quarter's positive results position us well for the remainder of the year with key highlights from the quarter beginning on Slide 19, including second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.52 and core EPS of $0.70, both of which include $15 million of restructuring expenses primarily associated with the CEO transition that took place in May. FFELP NIM of 97 basis points; private NIM of 297 basis points; originations of $197 million; business processing revenues of $83 million, an overall efficiency ratio of 56%; and maintained an adjusted tangible equity ratio of 8.4%, while returning $100 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.I'll provide additional detail by segment, beginning with Federal Education Loans on Slide 20. In the Federal Education Loan segment, we achieved a net interest margin of 97 basis points compared to 111 basis points a year ago. The decline from the year ago period was primarily driven by a lower balance of loans eligible to earn core income. Compared to the prior year, we saw net charge-offs increase to 22 basis points, which is consistent with the first quarter and anticipate that the net charge-off rate will decline and fall in a range of 10 to 20 basis points for the full year. While credit trends are within our expectations, the slowdown in prepayments that we are experiencing is expected to increase the life of the portfolio, which results in an increase in future cash flows along with expected future defaults.Now let's turn to our Consumer Lending segment on Slide 21. Net interest income in the quarter was $143 million and resulted in a net interest margin of 297 basis points, an improvement of 31 basis points compared to the prior year, driven largely by our improved funding spreads. We continue to see a slowdown in prepayment speeds in the overall portfolio as borrowers with fixed interest rates have less of an incentive to refinance in the current rate environment, which is benefiting net interest income.In the quarter, we originated $197 million of private education loans. This was comprised of $142 million of refi loan origination volume and $55 million of new in-school origination volume. The decline in refi volume originations from the prior year was primarily driven by the higher rate environment. We anticipate quarterly refi origination volume to remain at these lower levels throughout 2023, as we expect the restart of Department of Education loan payments this fall to provide no significant impact in the current rate environment. As anticipated, we are seeing an improvement in credit from the first quarter. Compared to the first quarter, net charge-off rates improved to 1.39% from 1.63%, and total delinquencies improved to 4.4% from 4.5%.Turning to allowance for loan losses and related coverage on Slide 22. We remain confident that we are adequately reserved for the expected life of loan losses, given the well-seasoned and high credit quality of our portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, our allowance for loan losses was just over $1.1 billion for our entire education loan portfolio. While credit metrics are improving, we remain cautious in our outlook as borrowers with over $1.5 trillion in education loan balances that are not on our balance sheet but held by the U.S. Government will be required to start making payments for the first time since March of 2020. While the portfolio is primarily amortizing, we reserved an additional $5 million for FFELP loans related largely to a projected extension in the life of the portfolio and $6 million for private education loans, of which $4 million is related to new origination volume.Let's continue to Slide 23 to review our Business Processing segment. Revenue from our BPS services increased $11 million from the first quarter to $83 million. The EBITDA margin increased to 10% from 7%, and we expect it to be in the high teens for the second half of the year as we benefit from ongoing efficiency initiatives. We expect to see revenue of at least $310 million for the full year 2023, primarily driven by the addition of new government services contracts.Let's turn to our capital allocation and financing activity that is highlighted on Slide 24. We continue to maintain strong asset liability and capital management with 84% of our education loan portfolio funded to term. During the quarter, we issued $500 million of unsecured debt and $718 million of asset-backed securities. Our adjusted tangible equity ratio of 8.4% is in line with our targeted range of 8% to 9% and up from 7.5% a year ago. In the quarter, we reduced our share count by 4% through the repurchase of 4.9 million shares. In total, we returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our 2023 EPS guidance includes a further reduction in share count from the projected share repurchases of $145 million for the remainder of the year.Let's turn to operating expenses on Slide 25. The continued efforts to improve efficiency and success across all of our business lines contributed to the strong quarterly results. The increases in consumer lending expenses were primarily related to marketing for the upcoming peak in-school origination season. We saw a 28% decline in expenses in the Federal Education segment due to lower transition services and a 17% decline in the overall FFELP portfolio. We achieved an efficiency ratio of 56% in the quarter, which is consistent with our full year guidance of 55% to 58%.In closing, the second quarter's core earning results of $0.70 reflect the steps we have taken to simplify the business, maintain strong capital levels and provide consistency in the face of a volatile rate environment. Our updated core EPS guidance range of $3.15 to $3.30 for the full year, which includes all regulatory and restructuring costs incurred to date as a result of this quarter's strong performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2023. Our outlook assumes a rate scenario that is based on the recent forward curve and that we do not see an acceleration of prepayment speeds related to changes in the federal student loan programs.As we continue to conduct the in-depth reviews that Dave mentioned in his remarks, I'd like to thank Team Navient for the continued dedication and commitment to increasing value for all stakeholders. Thank you for your time, and I will now open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners.William Haraway RyanWelcome, Dave. So I appreciate you're not yet ready to kind of discuss the individual lines of business and what you may be emphasizing a little bit more and maybe deemphasizing some other areas. But -- and you talked about cash flows and commitment to capital returns. One of the questions I had was about EPS. It's been fairly stable the last several years. As part of the initiatives that you're looking at doing, could we expect maybe some directional change maybe in the EPS? Because I think next year, you're going to be hitting a revenue inflection point where the recurring businesses are growing faster than the runoff. But obviously it's a question about how you're looking at the EPS side of the equation.Joe FisherSure. So thanks, Bill. I'll take that one just in terms of guidance. And obviously we're not yet providing 2024 guidance here, but as we think of the BPS business long term, historically, we thought of those non-pandemic related services, that business growing at about 10% a year in terms of organic growth. That's certainly the target that we look to achieve from a growth perspective. We are far exceeding that so far throughout this year. But with that 10% growth, we're also focused on high teens margins. So how I would think about next year for 2024 is that we'll continue to look to target that 10% at that high teens EBITDA margin levels, and then you can translate that to your EPS assumptions.William Haraway RyanOkay. And one quick follow-up. If you could talk maybe a little bit about the competitive landscape for in-school originations. Obviously, you're kind of early on in the peak origination quarter. If you could talk about how Navient's product offering is being received in the marketplace, and do you still expect originations to roughly double this year?David L. YowanSo nice to meet you, Bill. Thanks for your question. And look, we feel it's too early in the season to make a call on loan originations, as I'm sure you know, with third quarter being the peak season. We feel really good about the products that we're offering through the Earnest subsidiary. We're focused on being very disciplined about the margins and the returns we hope to achieve on that. And we'll certainly be ready to give you a more robust update in the third quarter on volumes. But too soon to call, but we feel really good about the products we're offering and the distribution channels that we have. The team at Earnest is very focused on providing our customers with a simple experience that has gotten some great reviews from us. So I think it's wait and see on in-school for this year. It's a little -- it is too early to make a call on that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley.Jeffrey David AdelsonAnd Dave, welcome and congratulations on the new role. Just maybe to start on the comment that Joe made on you don't expect any meaningful benefit to refi volumes as student loan repayments get going later this year. Another big lender in this space has been making some noise and saying that there's a ramp coming, and they're pitching that borrowers are going to be refying into these longer-term loans as they look to lower their monthly payment. I'm just curious, is this something that you're not expecting or expecting? Or are there any differences in your approach to the market that are more idiosyncratic that we should be aware of?David L. YowanSo thanks for the welcome, Jeff, and thanks for the question. Look, I think we -- as Joe indicated in his remarks, our experience and all of our insight into the market is that it is very much a rate-driven market. And given the fact that, in fact, rates aren't declining, but the Fed may increase them at least one more time here, we don't see the addressable market increasing significantly because of a payment pause. And so that's our view of it. We are absolutely open for business. Earnest has again demonstrated a capacity to market those loans effectively at scale. We've got the operational and financial flexibility if there's more demand. But you'll see in our loan forecast that was included in the slides that I spoke to, we've not increased that for the full year. So wait and see. We're open for business, but we don't see a significant increase in that addressable market until and unless rates begin to decline.Jeffrey David AdelsonGot it. That's helpful. And I think just one other question for me on the NIM outlook. Just wondering on the SOFR transition away from LIBOR, are there any impacts we should be thinking about in your asset liability management and how to think about the trajectory of impacts from here as rates change versus what was happening under the old construct?Joe FisherNo. So that was actually baked into our original guidance that we had provided, so I don't have any changes to the guidance at this point. And we have obviously changed our systems, implemented the change from LIBOR to SOFR, and things are going smoothly at this point.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan.Richard Barry ShaneWe really appreciate the additional slides and the change to the way you guys are providing guidance. It's helpful. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Consumer Lending segment and private student lending. Two things. First, when we look at Slide 5, I'm assuming that the growth in cash flows over the next 3 years is just a reflection of in-school loans going to repayment, and that's why we see the spike in '26. And then it starts to sort of decay as you would expect with the prepayment speed.Joe FisherSo actually, there are no originations projected in those cash flow slides, so we do not get the benefit of the future originations. It's actually a cutoff as of 6/30 if we were to run the portfolio out. But it is a good call out. In terms of the increase, that actually has to do with certain financings that are taking place in those outer years. As you know, Rick, we have various repurchase facilities that we use to fund existing trusts and then borrow against that over- collateralization. So what this reflects is calling those trusts at that time and refinancing them into more traditional securitizations after paying down that debt. So it is an increase, but it has to do with the way we finance today versus new originations.Richard Barry ShaneJoe, that's really helpful. And David, I apologize. Welcome. Wanted to ask you a question related to this segment as well. As you're conducting your strategic review, if you were to go out and create a bank today, it would look very different than the way you created a bank even a decade or 2 decades ago. As you think about reentering the private student lending market and growing market share there, what do you see strategically that you will do different than perhaps the way the business was done a decade ago? Is it about chasing preferred lenders lists, or is it more about direct marketing and online? How does that business evolve if you could create it in 2023?David L. YowanThanks for the welcome, Rick, and thanks for the feedback on the slides. We appreciate that. Trying to provide information that's clear and helpful to you. Look, I think in consumer lending, you can look and see what we do today and particularly what we've done with Earnest, which is designed to provide an experience for customers upfront that is largely, if not exclusively, digital. It's a simple experience. As you know, many financial products, if you think about the marketing funnel for those, you lose a lot of people when they first engage because they need to provide information that's not readily available. And so it's about simplicity at point of sale that I think we have focused on. We don't -- it's clear we don't need to be a bank in order to be simple at point of sale.In terms of our financial structure, obviously we feel like we have a lot of capacity, cost-effective sources of capital to finance our loans. There's a history of Navient managing through a wide variety of market scenarios and environments. The team here is -- as a former treasurer, I can tell you, the team here is really good at finding capital in a really cost effective way to -- and managing the interest rates and other elements of other financial risks associated with these loans. So I think it's about simplicity at the point of sale, offering innovations in products, whether it's rate driven, payment driven, et cetera, and having a strong financial capacity to support that business. We feel like we have those today. We'll be looking for ways across all of our businesses to do better, but we feel good about the foundation of assets and capabilities that we have today that allow us to compete effectively.Richard Barry ShanePerfect. And we look forward to hearing what's next.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.Sanjay Harkishin SakhraniWelcome, Dave. Maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on the review you're undertaking. I know you mentioned you're in the process and you touched a little bit on it before. But I was also just hoping you could elaborate on the philosophy that you might apply versus what was the case before. Obviously, you were on the Board as well. So maybe you could just give us a little bit of a lay of the land in terms of how we should think about this on a go-forward basis.David L. YowanThanks, Sanjay, for the question. I think I'd call you to the imperatives that we put on the page. Those are the 4 things that I'm focused on. I think to your -- as suggested in your point, those 4 things are not new. They're focusing on our -- maximizing our cash flows, enhancing the value of growth, being more simple and more efficient, and distributing capital to shareholders while retaining a strong balance sheet growth.I think what any change in leadership does is when you look at things with a different lens and perhaps a wider aperture than we've had before, that's how I would sort of characterize the way I'm thinking about looking at those 4 imperatives. I think those are the right 4 imperatives for the company. I don't see those changing as we think about this. But I think any new leader looks at, in my experience, you have a different lens, and so you look at things in a different way. I'm charged with the Board in what I would describe as having a wider aperture to think about. So sort of nothing is off the table. I'm not here to put anything on the table because it's too soon to do that.I talked a little bit at the end on -- about some of my thinking here. This is a company that has undergone some pretty significant changes in its footprint, whether it's the acquisition of the Business Processing Segment, the beginning, some would say resumption if you go back to the Sallie Mae days, of being a loan originator, and our decision to exit the ed servicing contract, that, as you can imagine, that significantly changed the scope and scale of our loan servicing operations. And so I talked about making sure that the scale of our business, our operations is aligned with the scale of our current and future business needs.I also talked about trying to variabilize expenses. I think that's critical whether you're growing or whether, as in some parts of our business like FFELP, revenue is declining. And here, the company has a record of doing that. We sold our servicing platform a couple of years ago and effectively converted that fixed expense into a pay-by-the-drink expense. I think that's a good example of what we've done historically, and we're going to look for more opportunities to do things like that.Sanjay Harkishin SakhraniGot it. And I guess along those same lines, that CFPB litigation is still sort of looming out there. I'm just curious sort of where we're at, how amenable you might be to have a different outcome in some ways in terms of the process. I mean maybe you can just update us on that as well.David L. YowanYes, sure. So as you know, both parties filed motions for summary judgments in May of 2020. Those motions have been briefed. No trial or hearing date has been set for those motions. We feel really confident about the strength of our case. But having said that, I think we are certainly open and would like to find a solution that's acceptable to all parties that would put the matter behind us.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Courtney Bahlman with Barclays.Courtney Elizabeth BahlmanWelcome, David. Just a really quick one for me. Most of my questions have already been answered. I apologize if I missed, but is there any change to the way that you all are thinking about bond repurchases or liability management exercises in the course of operations here?Joe FisherNo, there's no change, Courtney. From our perspective, we're in a very good position in terms of our upcoming maturities. We have $1.3 billion of cash on hand. We have the future cash flows coming over the next several quarters that we described in our presentation, as well as $1.4 billion of unencumbered loans and another just over $5 billion of OC that we have the ability to borrow against. So we feel in a very good position here to address the upcoming maturities. And as I've spoken with you before, if there's opportunities to get those bonds at a discount, we certainly evaluate that. But there just haven't been as many opportunities recently.Courtney Elizabeth BahlmanUnderstood.Joe FisherThank you.OperatorOur next question is a follow-up from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners.William Haraway RyanJust a quick follow-up. There's been some proposals made on changes to IDR and debt forgiveness. What's the process by which those changes would be implemented, like what kind of time frame? And second, do you see any potential impact on your portfolios from those changes specifically in the federal loan segment?Joe FisherSure, Bill. So the way I think about just the various programs that have been announced and programs that have been announced over the years here is that there are over 56 different repayment options available to federal student loan borrowers today. So there are host of ways to reduce the payments to have forgiveness. And I view this as another option that's again more attractive. So we saw obviously prepayments increase a year ago with the -- or actually less than a year ago with just the announcement surrounding debt forgiveness. While we would anticipate some level of prepayment activity with another program, at this point, it's just too early to gauge what that would look like. But as I've said in the past, there has been significant opportunities over the years, whether it's interest rate reductions, debt forgiveness, various IBR programs. And we've just got a very well-seasoned FFELP portfolio at this time. So with each introduction, there's been less and less of an impact.William Haraway RyanOkay. And then what kind of a time frame are we thinking about if they get implemented as is? Would it be a year from now or so?Joe FisherYes, I think that's a tough one to tell, but I think your time frame is the right way to think about it.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point.Giuliano Jude Anderes BolognaCongratulations on the new role. One question I'd be curious about, and this might be a little bit of a follow-up to what Bill was just touching on. I'd be curious if you can provide a sense of what percentage of your FFELP book is enrolled in IDR plans currently, just as it is a way to think about how that could flow through to some of the newer forgiveness programs related to IDR plans.Joe FisherYes. So in terms of IDR programs today as a percent of the overall portfolio, it's about 35% of borrowers and 45% of balances.Giuliano Jude Anderes BolognaThat is very helpful. Then I realize a lot of these questions have been asked in many different forms. But I'd be curious, when you think about the opportunities in the review process, do you think there's a greater emphasis on to figure out ways to optimize the cost structure? Or on the other side, is there a greater focus on trying to figure out new growth verticals for the different businesses? Or is it kind of all inclusive? Just trying to get a sense if you think there's an enhanced focus on growth versus cost cutting or vice versa.David L. YowanYes. I think -- so thanks for the question. Again, I think at this point, it's a very broad aperture that we have. And so it definitely includes -- and under simplicity and efficiency, that includes becoming more efficient from looking at operating expenses, looking at the scale and scope of our operations really carefully, as I've indicated, finding ways to variabilize as many expenses as we can. But it also includes enhancing the value of our growth businesses. And if that requires -- the idea behind trying to increase the free cash flows from our portfolios is it gives us greater flexibility and greater capacity to invest in those growth businesses and/or -- and return capital to shareholders. Our first step is to undertake and see if we can increase those free cash flows. And then as we're able to do that, we'll share with you how we're going to deploy that. But at this point, it's too soon to make a call on one versus the other I think at this point.Giuliano Jude Anderes BolognaAll right. Maybe one quick follow-up on that thread. You obviously come from a good position with a great funding structure, capital and cash flow. I'd be curious if you'd consider looking at M&amp;A for kind of asset manufacturing platforms, or if you think you have the kind of asset growth platforms internally now or can obviously build them internally.David L. YowanI guess I'd say 2 things. I'd say first, everything's on the table, but I would say that I think we feel really good and confident about the capabilities we have to originate private education finance loans. I think Earnest has demonstrated, particularly in the low rate environment, an ability to originate refi loans, education finance loans at scale in a way that has pleased customers and in a way that has produced we feel are really good returns for our shareholders. So I think we've got -- and that platform I think has -- we think has more capacity in it. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are. I wouldn't take anything off the table, but I do feel pretty comfortable with our ability to at scale originate private education loans at the moment.Giuliano Jude Anderes BolognaThat's great. I'll turn back in the queue.OperatorI would now like to hand the conference back over to Jen Earyes for closing remarks.Jen EaryesThank you, Shannon.

This compares to earnings of $0.92 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -7.89%.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Navient: mixed.

These results were significantly better than the company's guidance due to stronger pricing on closer-in demand and further strength in onboard revenue.

We also expect to achieve record Adjusted EBITDA per APCD and Return on Invested Capital this year and are well on our way toward achieving our Trifecta goals.""Key HighlightsStrong ticket pricing from both North America and Europe itineraries, combined with strength in onboard revenue, led to better-than-expected revenues in the second quarter and the significant increase in the company's full year outlook for revenue and earnings.Second Quarter 2023:Gross Margin Yields increased 13.1% As-Reported, and Net Yields increased 12.9% in Constant-Currency (12.6% As-Reported), both compared to the second quarter of 2019.Gross Cruise Costs per Available Passenger Cruise Day (""APCD"") increased 10.9% As-Reported, and Net Cruise Costs (""NCC""), excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 9.0% in Constant-Currency (8.6% As-Reported), both compared to the second quarter of 2019. Favorable timing of operating expenses was offset by the increase in stock compensation expense due to the rise in share price and expected financial performance.Total revenues were a record $3.5 billion, Net Income was $458.8 million or $1.70 per share, Adjusted Net Income was $491.7 million or $1.82 per share, Adjusted EBITDA was a record $1.2 billion and Operating Cash Flow was $1.4 billion.Story continuesFull Year 2023 Outlook:Net Yields are expected to increase 11.5% to 12.0% in Constant-Currency and As-Reported, compared to 2019.NCC, excluding Fuel, per APCD is expected to be up approximately 7.0% in Constant-Currency (6.7% As-Reported), compared to 2019.  The increase in costs, relative to previous guidance, is driven by an increase in stock compensation  expense due to the rise in share price and expected financial performance.Adjusted Earnings per Share for the full year are expected to be in the range of $6.00 to $6.20 per share.Third Quarter 2023 Outlook:Net Yields are expected to increase 13.5% to 14.0% in Constant-Currency (14.0% to 14.5% As-Reported), compared to the third quarter of 2019.NCC, excluding Fuel, per APCD is expected to increase approximately 11.2% in Constant-Currency and As-Reported, compared to third quarter 2019. Approximately half of the cost increase compared to 2019 is related to structural costs, timing shift of operating expenses from the second quarter, and increase in stock compensation expense.Adjusted Earnings per Share for the third quarter are expected to be in the range of $3.38 to $3.48 per share.Second Quarter 2023The company reported Net Income for the second quarter of $458.8 million or $1.70 per share compared to Net Loss of $(0.5) billion or $(2.05) per share for the same period in the prior year. The company also reported Adjusted Net Income of $491.7 million or $1.82 per share for the second quarter compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $(0.5) billion or $(2.08) per share for the same period in the prior year.Second quarter revenue significantly exceeded the company's guidance due to higher pricing and higher shipboard revenue across the company's key itineraries, including the Caribbean and Europe. Load factor for the second quarter was 105%.Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 10.9% As-Reported, compared to 2019. NCC, excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 8.6% As-Reported and 9.0% in Constant-Currency, compared to 2019.  Favorable timing of operating expenses drove NCC lower, however it was offset entirely by an increase in stock compensation expense related costs due to the significant rise in share price and expected financial performance.Update on BookingsBooking volumes in the second quarter remained significantly higher than the corresponding period in 2019 and at record pricing levels. Demand for 2023 sailings has significantly exceeded expectations and bookings for 2024 sailings are up significantly versus all prior years at record prices. Demand from the North American consumer has remained incredibly strong throughout the year, and booking volumes from European consumers who are booking European cruises this summer have accelerated.The further increase in yield expectations for the year is the result of higher pricing and onboard revenue expectations for key itineraries, particularly in North America and Europe.  Consumer spending onboard, as well as pre-cruise purchases, continue to significantly exceed 2019 levels driven by greater participation at higher prices.As of June 30, 2023, the Group's customer deposit balance was at a record-high $5.7 billion.Fuel ExpenseBunker pricing net of hedging for the second quarter was $682 per metric ton and consumption was 405,000 metric tons.The company does not forecast fuel prices and its fuel cost calculations are based on current at-the-pump prices, net of hedging impacts. Based on today's fuel prices, the company has included $275 million of fuel expense in its third quarter guidance at a forecasted consumption of 408,000 metric tons, which is 55% hedged via swaps. Forecasted consumption is 54%, 60% and 40% hedged via swaps for the remainder of 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.DefinitionsSelected Operational and Financial MetricsAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the 2023 and 2022 periods, these items included (i) other (income) expense; (ii) gain on sale of controlling interest; (iii) recovery of losses from one of our equity method investees; (iv) impairment and credit losses (recoveries); and (v) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (""Adjusted EPS"") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is a non-GAAP measure that represents Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) loss on the extinguishment of debt; (ii) gain on sale of controlling interest; (iii) tax on the sale of PortMiami noncontrolling interest; (iv) Silver Whisper deferred tax liability release; (v) recovery of losses from one of our equity method investees; (vi) impairment and credit losses (recoveries); (vii) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; and (viii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses.Available Passenger Cruise Days (""APCD"") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.Constant Currency is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in ""Constant Currency"" - i.e., as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period's rates. For the 2023 periods presented, we calculate ""Constant Currency"" by applying the average 2019 period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and/or forecasted period, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis.Invested Capital represents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus Total shareholders' equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).Occupancy (""Load Factor""), in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.Passenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.Gross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.Net Cruise Costs (""NCC"") and NCC excluding Fuel are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel, fuel expenses. For the 2023 and 2019 periods presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel exclude (i) the gain on sale of controlling interest; (ii) impairment and credit losses (recoveries); (iii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (iv) incidental costs related to the Oasis of the Seas incident included within cruise operating expenses; and (v) the transaction costs related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.Gross Margin Yield represent Gross Margin per APCD.Adjusted Gross Margin represent Gross Margin, adjusted for payroll and related, food, fuel, other operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Gross Margin is calculated pursuant to GAAP as total revenues less total cruise operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.Net Yields represent Adjusted Gross Margin per APCD. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that represents operating income (loss) including income (loss) from equity investments and income taxes but excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. We use this non-GAAP measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).Return on Invested Capital (""ROIC"") represents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. ROIC is also used as a key metric in our long-term incentive compensation program for our executive officers.Trifecta refers to the multi-year Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC goals we publicly announced in November 2022 and are seeking to achieve by the end of 2025. We designed this program to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longer-term financial objectives. Under the Trifecta Program, we are targeting Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of at least $100, Adjusted EPS of at least $10, and ROIC of 13% or higher by the end of 2025.For additional information see ""Adjusted Measures of Financial Performance"" below.Adjusted Measures of Financial PerformanceThis press release includes certain adjusted financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.The presentation of adjusted financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures may be different from adjusted measures used by other companies. In addition, these adjusted measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Adjusted measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures.A reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure of all adjusted financial measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because preparation of meaningful U.S. GAAP projections would require unreasonable effort. Due to significant uncertainty, we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs. In addition, we are unable to determine the future impact of non-core business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives. These items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to this uncertainty, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful. ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(Nasdaq: ADI), a global semiconductor leader, today celebrated its more than $1 billion investment to expand its semiconductor wafer fab in Beaverton, Oregon. The Beaverton site, built in 1978, is ADI’s largest wafer fabrication facility by volume and serves customers in critical industries, such as industrial, automotive, communications, consumer, and healthcare.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726603504/en/Ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate ADI's more than $1 billion investment to expand its semiconductor wafer fab in Beaverton, Oregon. Pictured left to right: Vincent Roche, ADI’s CEO and Chair and Vivek Jain, ADI's Executive Vice President, Global Operations &amp; Technology. (Photo: Business Wire)The facility investment expands cleanroom space to about 118,000 sq-ft and nearly doubles internal manufacturing of products running on the 180-nanometer technology node and above. It is also expected to create hundreds of new, long-term employment opportunities, a significant increase to ADI’s current roughly 950 employees in Oregon.More than 10% of the total investment is for new, state-of-the-art fab tools intended to increase overall efficiency and utilize chemistries that are more environmentally friendly. Despite nearly doubling production output, the facility is targeting to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 75% and water usage per production unit by approximately 50%.""By expanding ADI’s Beaverton facility, we are increasing our production capacity in critical industries, boosting domestic manufacturing in line with the vision of the CHIPS Act, and enhancing the global resiliency of ADI’s hybrid manufacturing model,"" said Vincent Roche, ADI’s CEO and Chair. ""While our investment in Beaverton will facilitate these goals, they will be achieved through the incredible dedication and talent of ADI's existing workforce and further tapping into Oregon's strong talent pool.""Story continuesCommenting on the announcement, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said, ""Today’s good news from Analog Devices marks a significant step to ensure Oregon is taking full advantage of the federal CHIPS Act I worked to pass into law. This announcement strengthens a signature industry in Oregon by solidifying semiconductors’ place in the Silicon Forest and beyond, creating statewide impact with new good-paying jobs in Beaverton and rippling out to benefit the entire state economy.""In addition, the Beaverton facility will host the Semiconductor Advanced Manufacturing University (SAMU), a workforce development training center that will offer eight-week courses to train groups of around 25 students each on semiconductor equipment maintenance. A key driver of ADI’s efforts with the training center is providing training opportunities to many diverse groups within the local community, including U.S. military veterans, people re-entering the workforce, and existing ADI factory operators, to learn semiconductor manufacturing fundamentals and other curriculum to advance their professional development.ADI’s hybrid manufacturing model is a broad network of internal factories and external partners. This model enables effective management of ADI operations through economic cycles, enhances the resiliency of its global supply chain, and better serves its customer needs. To improve ADI-owned operations, the company has increased capital investment to a high single-digit percent of revenue in fiscal year 2022 and to date in fiscal year 2023 from its historical precedent of around four percent. These manufacturing investments span the globe, including in the states of Washington and Massachusetts, as well as in Ireland, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines.About Analog Devices, Inc.Analog Devices, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $1.17 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.97%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $1.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.12, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Silicon Labs , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $244.87 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.64%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $263.15 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Silicon Labs shares have added about 17% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19%.What's Next for Silicon Labs?While Silicon Labs has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Silicon Labs: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.09 on $253.59 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.44 on $1.01 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Embedded Finance, or the integration of financial services into non-financial platforms, brings significant possibilities for innovation and business growth within Asia Pacific, from improving the customer experience to enabling seamless access to financial services for consumers and businesses, on everyday digital platforms.(PRNewsfoto/Visa)Lending is set to emerge as the top use case for Embedded Finance (US$141 billion), followed by deposits (US$56 billion) and payments (US$41 billion)[2]. SMB lending alone will comprise the majority of the opportunity within embedded lending, unlocking more than US$115 billion of addressable market value.""Embedded Finance represents a transformative opportunity for financial service and technology providers as well as software and digital providers in Asia Pacific. Financial institutions are not only taking notice, they are investing in building a new and differentiated Embedded Finance experience today across verticals such as embedded issuing, lending and payments,"" said TR Ramachandran, Head of Products and Solutions, Asia Pacific, Visa. ""We will continue to expand our offerings and partner with banks, fintechs, platform providers and merchants across the value chain, ensuring cost-efficiency while capturing growth opportunities and driving innovation. Together, we can pave the way for sustainable growth and shape what's next for consumers and businesses in the Embedded Finance space.""Enhancing overall customer experience through seamless integration of financial servicesCustomer expectations for relevant and user-friendly financial services have resulted in traditional banks, merchants and platforms embracing the Embedded Finance space to stay competitive.Story continuesSetting up core banking products within non-financial platforms enables businesses to enhance the customer journey by providing supplementary products or services that may not have been previously accessible to customers. For instance, banks can embed their services into popular non-financial platforms such as ride-sharing, messaging or business software applications. This accelerates expansion into new customer segments beyond those accessible via their traditional banking channels and is also an alternate distribution network that drives scale and a more cost-effective acquisition strategy for banks.Additionally, merchants and business-facing platforms can leverage Embedded Finance solutions to offer customers more seamless experiences – eliminating the need for customers to navigate to external channels to complete payments or sign up for new financial services separately.Navigating challenges on the path to growth and innovationWhile a dynamic market opportunity exists, industry players must adeptly navigate this burgeoning space in light of growing responsibilities in areas such as data privacy, regulatory requirements, and drop in brand saliency and differentiation. Navigation through these areas is critical to maximising the valuable opportunities presented by Embedded Finance.Bringing Embedded Finance to lifeMost recently, Visa announced a partnership with SAP to embed payments into the SAP ecosystem through SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), enabling further automation and efficiency of business-to-business (B2B) payments for businesses in Asia Pacific. Visa estimates that opportunities to digitise B2B payment flows today represent more than US$50 trillion across Asia Pacific[3].""Over the next few years, we foresee that financial institutions will need to redefine their go-to-market strategy to meet evolving customer needs and tap into the massive market opportunity provided by Embedded Finance,"" said Prateek Sanghi, Head of Visa Consulting and Analytics, Asia Pacific, Visa. ""For banks and businesses to stay competitive in this new era of financial services, they must strike the right partnerships to drive scale while building best-in-class solutions for customers and businesses.""With Visa's robust capabilities and strategic partnerships, all participants of the Embedded Finance ecosystem, from banks, non-financial institutions, fintechs, merchants to solution providers, have access to a comprehensive suite of financial solutions to support their diverse needs to capitalise on the rapid growth of Embedded Finance in Asia Pacific.About VisaVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

(Operator Instructions) At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.Craig A. LampoThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Our second quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions.As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.The company closed the second quarter with sales of $3,054 million and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 and $0.72, respectively. Second quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and organically -- and 4% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.Orders in the quarter were $3,044 million, which was down 12% compared to the second quarter of 2022, but up 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. GAAP operating income was $620 million in the second quarter of 2023, which included $4 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $624 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.3% and 20.4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of '22, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. And on an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially.This modest year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong downside conversion on the sales -- lower sales volumes as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions, which are currently operating below the corporate average. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels.Our team continues to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. During the second quarter, we were excited to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of RFS. The value of the net assets we acquired were in excess of the RFS purchase price. And as a result, we recorded a noncash gain of $5 million in the second quarter, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. In the third quarter of 2023, we expect to incur restructuring costs associated with RFS, which we estimate will be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. These costs will be excluded from our third quarter adjusted EPS results and are excluded from our Q3 2023 guidance.Breaking down second quarter results by segment, relative to the second quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $889 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, and segment operating margin was 27%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1,162 million and declined by 16% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 20.5%.Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1,003 million and increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.5%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.9% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 23.3% and 24.5% in the second quarter of 2022, respectively.GAAP diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.74 compared to $0.76 in the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased -- decreased 4% to $0.72 compared to $0.75 in the second quarter of 2022.Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $536 million or 120% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $442 million or nearly 100% of adjusted net income. We are very pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield.From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87, 71 and 48 days, respectively. Through the focused attention of our management team during the quarter, we were able to bring inventory days back in line with our normal range.During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $77. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2023 was $280 million. Total debt on June 30 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.8 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.Second quarter 2023 EBITDA was $736 million, and at the end of the second quarter of '23, our net leverage ratio was 0.9x. We are very pleased that the company's financial position remains extremely strong by any measure.I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.Story continuesRichard Adam NorwittWell, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today on this beautiful summer day here in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I do hope that all of you on the call, together with your family, friends and colleagues are enjoying a little bit of your summer thus far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I'll then spend a few moment to discuss our trends and the progress across our served markets and make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And then obviously, we'll have time for questions at the end.With respect to the second quarter, our results were better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales declined 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency reaching $3,054 million, with growth in commercial air, military and automotive end markets as well as contributions from our acquisitions, slightly more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, IT datacom and mobile devices segments. On an organic basis, sales did decline by 4%. We're very pleased that the company booked orders in the quarter of $3.044 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of 1:1.As Craig described, our margins in the quarter, adjusted operating margins were 20.4%, which was down 30 basis points from prior year, but which improved by 30 basis points from the first quarter sequentially. I'm very pleased that our margins in the second quarter once again reflected outstanding execution by our global management team, who continue to quickly adjust to changing demand and costs amidst these very dynamic times.Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter of $0.72 declined 4% from prior year but increased 4% from the sequential prior quarter. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow of $536 million and $442 million in the second quarter, yet another demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings.I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of our Amphenolian entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment.We're pleased to announce today that we closed the previously announced acquisition of the North American cable and global base station antenna business of RFS. Despite some current moderation in the mobile networks market, we remain excited about the long-term prospects of RFS as part of the Amphenol family. We now expect this acquisition to generate roughly $30 million of sales in the second half of 2023. In addition, we're pleased that just in the last few days, we closed on the acquisition of EBY Electro. EBY is based in the state of New York in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $15 million. And EBY is a designer and distributor of terminal block interconnect products to the North American industrial market. The addition of EBY further expands our offering of high-technology interconnect products into the diversified industrial market.As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new organizations into the Amphenol organization remains a core competitive advantage for us.Now turning to the trends and progress across our served markets. We're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad, in particular, in this very dynamic times, Amphenol's end market diversification continues to create great value for the company. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew by a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and this is really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these robust second quarter levels.I just have to say that we remain very encouraged by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We continue to make targeted investments to expand our capacity and look forward to supporting this increased demand with our broad product offering.Turning to the Commercial Aerospace market. This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and we had another very strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 40% in U.S. dollar and organically from prior year, as we benefited from both the continued recovery in global aircraft production as well as our ongoing efforts to expand our position within this market. Sequentially, our sales grew 9% from the first quarter, which was much better than expectations coming into the Q2.We're also very pleased that in the second quarter, our Commercial Air business was able to reach its highest ever level of quarterly sales. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these strong second quarter levels. And I'm just truly grateful to our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives in 2023 and beyond.The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market were flat in U.S. dollars and local currencies, but did decline by 7% organically, as growth in medical, transportation, oil and gas, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments was more than offset by moderations across the other segments of the industrial market together with lower sales to the distribution channel.On a sequential basis, sales declined 3% from the first quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations. This reflected some incremental slowing of demand from certain customers, in particular, in factory automation and heavy equipment. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these second quarter levels. Nevertheless, and despite this positive demand, I'm very proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.The automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, and this was slightly better than our expectations coming into Q2. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the second quarter. And I'm just really proud of our team working in automotive. And their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And this includes electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications.The mobile device market represented [8%] of our sales in the quarter, and our sales did moderate by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically in the second quarter, as strength in smartphones and related products was more than offset by declines in tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 3%, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-teens decline that we had coming into the quarter. As we now look into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase sequentially in the mid-teens from these second quarter levels on seasonal strength.While there's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets, our team once again in the second quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the second half of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond.The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 24% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically as we manage through the expected and broad-based weakness in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter declined by 6%, which was a touch better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect sales to remain at roughly similar levels as we achieved here in the second quarter.Look, there's no doubt that it's a challenging short-term wireless investment environment. But nevertheless, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. With now the addition of RFS together with our already broad array of products, when customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.The IT datacom market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. And while sales did decline by 24% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually better than we had expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, sales increased by 6%, which was in excess of our expectations for sales to be flat. This sequential uptick in sales was driven by a surge in demand from customers accelerating their investments in AI-focused systems or alternative intelligence -- artificial intelligence, which offset somewhat weaker demand in more traditional markets. We also saw robust orders for AI-related applications, which is a strong affirmation of our team's success in positioning Amphenol as a true leader in the interconnect systems that support AI. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels.While we are continuing to manage through the inventory adjustment in the broader IT market, we are more encouraged than ever by the company's position in this important space. Whether enabling the current surge in AI-related installations, or the broader range of Internet-enabling networks, our team has done an outstanding job developing leading high-speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for Amphenol.The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were flat from prior year and up just 1% organically as broadband operators tempered their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 2%, which was modestly better than our expectations. Now looking into the third quarter, we do expect a mid-single digit sequential decline in sales as operators moderate their spending following several quarters of strong demand and investments. Regardless of this momentary pause in demand, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, there remains a significant amount of government-funded initiatives, particularly in North America, which gives us confidence for the future of the broadband market.Now turning to our outlook and assuming the current market environment does not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $3.040 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. This would represent a sales decline of 6% to 8% and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 8% to 10% compared to the third quarter of 2022.I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our composition while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term.Finally, and really most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter.And operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Luke Junk with Baird.Luke L. JunkAdam, given all of the attention on AI recently. Just was hoping you can help us better understand the materiality to Amphenol based on what you've booked so far amid what you're calling the surge, I guess. Quantitatively, I'm thinking in terms of percentage of sales, either relative to IT datacom or maybe even relative to the company, overall? And then qualitatively, just any perspective on sizing the longer -- longer-term opportunity from your point of view given what's clearly very early innings right now? And just understanding how it's scaling in the business near term would be very helpful?Richard Adam NorwittWell, Luke, thank you very much. Look, without putting specific numbers on to subsegments of our 8 end markets, I will just tell you that as we came into the second quarter, we had a certain expectation to be flat. And I would tell you that kind of the underlying IT business was maybe even a touch weaker as customers continue to manage through inventory that they had built up over the last couple of years. Yet we ended up growing sequentially by 6%. And really, all of that upside -- more than just that upside came really from the near-term demand that we're seeing from a variety of customers who are building out their AI-related systems. In addition, we had a book-to-bill overall for the company of 1:1, but we had a very strong book-to-bill in our IT datacom market. I would tell you, it was about 1.1:1 in IT datacom, where we saw just really strong bookings which gives us confidence as we guided in the third quarter to be sequentially up.And so I'd say that it's -- while it's not the dominant thing in our IT datacom market far from it because it's really -- as you say, the early innings. We see the investments in AI as being a real significant dynamic for our company in the future -- in the near term and in the future. And to think about why that is you really have to get to the architecture of these AI systems. In particular, as customers build out these very intensive systems with these GPUs and otherwise, they built them out in a structure that requires just an enormous amount of interconnect. They call it kind of a fabric, if you will, of interconnect, where you have -- you're creating effectively a neural network. And in the neural network, everything has to connect to everything else, and it has to do that with high speed and low latency, while using as little power as possible. And that just puts an enormous premium on the highest of technology, high-speed products, on the most efficient interconnect -- power interconnect, and these are all things where Amphenol has a strong leadership position in the industry.Look, long term, I think we're in the early euphoria of AI right now. And I don't want to say kind of try to prognosticate what AI will mean, let alone what it will mean sort of ethically and morally, metaphysically and all of those things. But what we know for sure is it requires a lot of interconnect today. And as our customers are building on these networks, we stand ready to react to them in real time to make sure that they can stay competitive in a world that has become a real -- a significant dynamic for our customers. Many of them see this kind of existentially. And when they need us the most is when we step up to the plate always as Amphenol and are there for our customers. And I think that means that as they continue those investments long term, they'll continue to turn to us as really their first phone call.OperatorThe next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.Samik ChatterjeeI guess I'm just curious about the Industrial segment and this segment you were not very long ago doing double-digit organic growth. It's obviously moderated since then. This quarter, I think you had a decline is what you said. I mean how much of this is attributable to inventory digestion of the distributors versus essentially some of the demand -- direct demand from the end markets -- some of the end markets starting to turn negative? And any thoughts in terms of when you start to sort of cycle past those individual drivers in terms of timing?Richard Adam NorwittYes. Thank you very much, Samik. I think we talked at least last quarter about the fact that we started to see some signs of a little bit of -- some early signs of a little bit of inventory in the industrial market, including with our distributors. And no doubt about it, when we look at our results here in the second quarter, where we were in U.S. dollars flat, but organically, we were down by 7%. There is some element of that which comes from distributors managing a bit more of their inventory across the industrial market.And then there are a few segments of the industrial market where I think it's been well reported that there's a bit of softness in area like factory automation, on a year-over-year basis, something like instrumentation, where even if there's been this euphoria around semiconductor capital equipment, for example, there have also been pockets of that market where you have seen real pullbacks in CapEx. I think it's a market where long term, there's a great degree of optimism about the long term in semiconductor equipment, but there are some short-term vacillations that have been going on in the last quarter or 2.Those are areas that maybe I would highlight. I think that our position in industrial remains very broad. We continue to have parts of the industrial market that are performing extremely well. In fact, we saw great growth in areas like rail mass transit, alternative energy, even oil and gas, believe it or not. Medical continues to be a very strong area for us. And a credit to our team for never going kind of all in on any one segment of the industrial market, but rather continuing that long-term drive to be as present as possible with the broadest range of products as possible. And to the extent that -- to your question about how long that cycle, may be? Hard for me to guess. I mean I think we've had similar questions about IT datacom in the past. Here, I think you have certainly some correction that is happening with distributors, whether that is a 1, 2, 3 quarter, hard for me to guess and we'll certainly let you know as soon as we have a better view of that.OperatorThe next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.Mark Trevor DelaneyIs there anything in particular that has been helping gross margins such as price/cost mix or the integration of acquisitions or the gross margin in 2Q was at the highest in about 5 years, even as a handful of end markets are still soft. So I'm hoping to better understand what may be positively impacting margins? And then any color you can share on how to expect either gross or EBIT margins to trend going forward?Craig A. LampoYes. Thanks, Mark. Yes. No, we're -- I mean, we're really just proud of kind of this overall profitability here in the second quarter. I mean we converted on a sequential basis, just under 35%, which is certainly far exceeding kind of our 25% kind of goal on higher sales. And year-over-year, the negative version is 30%, which was certainly roughly kind of what we kind of expect on the downside. But if you actually peel acquisitions away from that, it's really even much better than this 30% that we certainly reported in U.S. dollars here. So I think overall, the profitability just of the company just continues to be very robust and really just -- is really because of this great work of the management team to be able to continue to protect the bottom line when we have some markets like communications market, specifically IT datacom that has, on a year-over-year basis, really seen some significant declines in mobile networks and mobile devices and all sort. So this is really just a great representation of the agility of the entire team to be able to have these robust margins in this environment.I mean specific to gross margins, we typically don't necessarily measure ourselves on gross margins or SG&amp;A. We really do look at operating margin, which is kind of looking at all aspects of cost. But certainly, to your point, gross margins have -- were higher this quarter than they have been over certainly the recent past. And I think that if you look at kind of the mix of our markets, our markets certainly do have -- our businesses that serve that certain markets do have sometimes higher gross margins or in high SG&amp;A or lower gross margin and lower SG&amp;A to kind of get to those operating margins that we expect. And so sometimes the mix of the sales in those markets could have an impact on the overall mix that you're talking about from a gross margin or SG&amp;A perspective. I think we're seeing some of that in our business in the second quarter, where places like military and commercial air certainly very strong.But I think overall, regardless of how they fluctuate kind of what we're focused on here is operating margin. So I think that -- whether or not gross margin SG&amp;A fluctuates a bit on a quarterly basis, I wouldn't necessarily be concerned or be super focused on that. But at the end of the day, I think, really, what we're focused on is making sure that our operating margins continue to drive good robust leverage on the higher sales. And I think that's exactly what we're seeing. And as we move forward, even our guidance implies really as strong. I think conversion and leverage going into here the third quarter.And certainly, I think pricing over the last year has helped a bit with that. But I think that's kind of necessarily a new story. I think we talked about us kind of catching up on pricing kind of later last year. So I wouldn't call that a 2023 story in terms of pricing. I think pricing cost at this point is relatively neutral and certainly, we'll react to anything that happens in the cost environment if that changes. But certainly, very happy with the overall margins, and we're going to continue to march forward on that front.OperatorThe next question is from Abdullah Khan with Evercore.Abdullah KhanI wanted to ask about autos and specifically, we've seen some auto OEMs take down inventories that were built up during the worst crisis of the supply chain. And so I wanted to get your perspective on that, if you have an estimate of how much inventory is overbuilt, if there is any, and as well as the various percentages around the end market?Richard Adam NorwittThank you very much, Abdullah. Honestly, we don't have a good read on the auto OEM inventory, whether that's overbuilt or whether they're taking it down. I think what we know is that what our customers are taking from us and what we're able to support them with. And in the quarter, we were able to have a very strong -- yet another very strong quarter in automotive, growing by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. And I think that's just a testament to our team's continued success in developing new products that go on new applications in the car. And so -- to the extent that there is some vacillation that should come, if automakers decide to take more inventory or less inventory if they sell more cars or less cars, I mean these are kind of things that are what they are. But what we can control is our position on these new applications on things like electrified drivetrains, on things like advanced safety, on things like advanced communication and so many other new applications that are going into cars.I mean I just got a new car recently, and I still, after a couple of weeks, haven't figured out half of what the darn thing can do. And it just reminds me how many new systems are put into these cars, how many new applications and how much content for new products that weren't previously in a car. And we're seeing products being sold into cars that in the past, we were selling things that went into computers or to other advanced systems, and all of a sudden, they're being repackaged and repurposed to go into these cars where the continued growth in content is really explosive. And so I don't know, was inventory going down a little bit this quarter when we were going up 11% organically, maybe others have a better read on that than we do. But for sure, we continue to see strong momentum in automotive. And I think next quarter, we have once again a strong outlook in this market, and that's after several years of real outperformance to any comparable measure.OperatorThe next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.Wamsi MohanAdam, I know you mentioned it's a hard market to nail down seasonality. But if you think about seasonality in mobile devices and where you're guiding to in the mid-teens, that's the lowest level since 2016. It's at least 15 points below what you typically guide or well, typically achieve anyway. And when I sort of look at even 2016, that was a year where 2Q grew in the mid-teens, and you were coming off a much stronger base. So can you help us think through maybe what you're seeing today in terms of what seasonality it feels as though, at least from what we hear, at least on the PC side, there is a sequential improvement. So just wondering what the puts and takes are that you're seeing that's causing you to guide to good mid-teens over here.Richard Adam NorwittYes. Wamsi, thanks so much. I mean, look, I'll put this maybe in a couple of contexts. One is that we came into the second quarter with an expectation for the market to be actually down in the mid-teens. And we ultimately achieved on a sequential basis, close to 20 points better than that, growing by 3% sequentially. Yes, still down on a year-over-year basis, but very strong compared to our expectations. And that strength really did come out of smartphones, in particular. And as we look at our guidance here for the third quarter, I think you're arithmetically correct, that 17% sequential in the third quarter is maybe a touch lower than what we've seen in years past, maybe 2016 to the contrary notwithstanding.But if we break that down a little bit, I can just tell you this, that our expectation for our sales into smartphones is actually very robust, actually, I would say, even a little bit above our normal seasonality. And that's offset by a more modest expectation in areas like tablets and laptops and other computing devices. And look, I don't know what the PC forecasts are, how those relate to, to the various devices that we're selling into. But one dynamic is, for sure, is that with COVID happening over the recent 3 years, there was a surge in demand for those products that were really used for home -- by people who are studying and working and otherwise communicating from home. And that kind of put a little bit of a hitch in the typical replacement cycle of a lot of these devices.And I think we're still seeing a bit of a hangover from that right now in terms of the overall demand for those devices. Meanwhile, the smartphone products, our position on smartphones remains very robust, and we see strong growth potential in smartphones going forward into the third quarter. And that ultimately comes all together with this mid-teens expectation that we have on a sequential basis for the third quarter.Look, I mean, you can get pretty gray hair pretty quickly by trying to guess all the ins and outs of where the mobile device market is headed. And we do our best job as we can in giving an outlook for that. But then once we give that outlook, as you know, our team is not resting on their laurels. They're ready at any time to capitalize on any upside that may come along or to manage through a downside that make it along as well, and it remains our hardest market to forecast and guide to. And it remains our team that is the most agile of any that I've ever seen in the industry. So I'm confident going forward, that our team will continue to create great success and that our robust position in this market will continue to create great value for Amphenol.OperatorThe next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.Matthew John SheerinAdam, I wanted to asked about the military market. You've had some very strong double-digit growth here for a few quarters and your outlook continues to be strong. Could you talk about some of the drivers and maybe some of the programs and the diversification within those end markets?Richard Adam NorwittYes. Thanks very much, Matt. No doubt about it, our team working in the military aerospace market or defense market, as I actually call it a little bit often these days, is doing a great job. And it's interesting. We track, I don't know, kind of 10 or a dozen different subsegments of that market. And about 3/4 or even closer to like 8 out of 10 of those markets grew in very strong double digits on a year-over-year basis, last quarter, with just a couple of them, a little bit lower performance. And it just reflects the real breadth of our position and the breadth of investments that countries around the world are making in new defense technologies.I mean, look, I look every day at what's happening with the tragedy in Ukraine. I looked with some anxiety at some of the other geopolitical tensions that are around the world. At the same time, I think we at Amphenol look in the mirror, and we feel very positive about the role that our team is directly playing in ensuring that the free people of the world get to remain free. And that reactivity of our team to grow by 19% organically on a year-over-year basis in a market with a product set that is not an easy product set to scale. I mean, these are products that are very complex to manufacture. They require an immense amount of qualifications and adherence to standards. They're very vertically integrated.And so to flex one's capacity, in this market, as we have done, is really an extraordinary [feel] and one that is not lost on our customers in terms of our ability to really do what it takes and our willingness to invest when need be and to flex whenever possible to satisfy this really kind of existential demand that we're seeing in many cases.As I look forward in the defense market, I think for better or for worse, I think we are in an era today of more anxiety, more dynamics where more and more, the nations that are allied with our country, with the Europeans and others are having to invest more significantly than ever before in next-generation defense technologies. And it's the broadest manufacturer of those products -- both having the broadest product line in the deepest technologies, we're ready and able to support that as much as possible. We'll see. I mean we're guiding here in the third quarter to a kind of similar levels in what is traditionally a softer third quarter from a seasonality perspective. And our team stands ready to react whenever needed. And every day we watch the pictures coming from Ukraine. And while we have a tear in one eye, we also have a pride in our belly of the part that we're doing to help those people stay free.OperatorThe next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.Steven Bryant FoxAdam, I was just hoping to circle back a little bit more on the industrial markets. I mean the macro data is looking worrisome, but I'm trying to understand how much of your sales on to like(inaudible) plant floors is under pressure, maybe where there's some good signs and how long of a pipeline you're thinking at just industrial factory.Richard Adam NorwittThanks very much, Steven. Look, I think we talked a little bit about factory automation as one area that I highlighted that we did see on a year-over-year basis, some downturn. And also on the sequential system, I think it's been broadly reported that there's some moderation in demand around that area. How long that's going to last? It's really hard, Steven, for me to give a prognosis on. I think that we have a very strong position here. I think that the adoption of electronics in factories. The underlying trend of that, I think, is a very positive trend in the short, medium and in particular, the long term.As countries and companies around the world deal with labor shortages, and I mean, gosh, you can't pick up a newspaper these days without seeing something about some either labor shortage or labor strike that is happening in the world over, there's no doubt that the adoption of electronic -- automation, robotics, next-generation factory management systems, I mean, these are really accelerating broadly. And the fact that we go through right now, let's call it, a kind of temporary pause in that for a variety of reasons. It does not take away from the very long-term prognosis for factory automation, which I think is quite a positive over the long term.OperatorThe next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS.Christopher M. SnyderI wanted to follow up on some of the AI commentary from earlier. It certainly seems to be an opportunity right in the company to real house and obviously, great to see meaningful revenue impact already. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the competitive landscape for these high-power, low latency data center applications and Amphenol's competitive positioning within that. I would assume there's not too many companies that can deliver this technology.Richard Adam NorwittYes. Thanks so much, Chris. I mean, look, these are really hard products to make, let's start from that. To have a high-speed interconnect product, be it a cable assembly, an IO connector, a backplane connector, a cable backplane system, whatever it may be, these are extraordinarily complicated products to make where the underlying technology to make them take years to develop. The manufacturing processes are extremely challenging to make these things. And so you're correct. There is a very small universe of companies, and we have strong competitors. There's no doubt about it, who we respect, no question. But it is a relatively confined universe of companies who ultimately have put in the decades, and I call it really decades of investments in the engineering competency, the test and the validation of those products and all of those things, which ultimately allow one to make a reliable product that can support these next-generation complicated AI learning systems.Our position, look, we are the world leader in high-speed interconnect technology. That's something that we're very proud of and that we continue to be very carefully building upon over the years and that position, I think, is a robust one for as AI investments continue.OperatorThe next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.Joseph Craig GiordanoJust curious if you can give some color or kind of update on how your mix in auto regionally has shifted over time. Just given the growth that you've had over the last several years, just commentary like you expect 3Q to be kind of similar to 2Q, but production is supposed to be down sequentially like 5%. So I'm just curious if some of that is just content you're winning or some of that is regional shifts and you're participating more in faster growth markets than you used to. Just any color there would be helpful.Richard Adam NorwittYes. Thanks very much, Joe. Look, I think if you look over a very long time period, the mix of our auto business has changed quite dramatically. I remember, gosh, when I first became CEO, and that's 15 years ago, not to mention when I first join the company which was 25 years ago yesterday, our auto business was a predominantly European business. And even in my first quarter as CEO, I think it was roughly 2/3 was European and the rest was sort of split evenly between Asia and North America. And today, I would tell you that the 3 regions are relatively balanced with maybe a touch more in Asia, followed by Europe and North America. So that has changed a lot.And I think part of that change has been really this revolution electrification where our team has done a fabulous job in taking advantage of that revolution electrification, and where the largest markets for that, at least so far, have been in Asia, and we've done an excellent job of positioning ourselves on a broad basis with companies who are really driving electrified and hybrid electrified vehicles.And so if I look at last quarter, we grew organically really in all 3 regions. I would say Europe actually grew the strongest last quarter, but we did realize growth in all 3 regions. And I think we have a very robust position across all regions for the automotive market. And to the extent that those dynamics change, there's new companies, accelerating their performance in other regions. I'm confident that our team is going to do a good job of positioning ourselves there to benefit from that.OperatorAnd our last question comes from Will Stein with Truist Securities.William SteinI'd like to ask about the broadband end market. it's been fairly well discussed among companies and in the media that there are several big projects in the U.S. like RDOF and other countries as well, to deliver broadband to more rural areas. And I wonder if you can describe how that's been influencing demand in that end market and your anticipated performance over the next few quarters?Richard Adam NorwittYes. Thanks very much, Will. Look, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that while we do see a temporary pause, I mean, we've had really strong growth in broadband over the last year. I mean, last year alone, we grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically. And yes, I mean, in the second quarter, we were flat and we guided it to be a little bit down sequentially in the third quarter. But no doubt about it, we are benefiting not just from the demand for customers around the world for higher speed connectivity to their homes and businesses, but also from the government funding that is going into this. And in particular, you mentioned RDOF, there's also BEAD, both of these initiatives in North America are very significant. And by the way, long overdue from my perspective.I mean we live in a world where connectivity to the Internet becomes not just a nice thing to have, but it is really -- it is a kind of thing that you must have. It's like electricity and access to water and indoor plumbing, having the plumbing to the Internet is so critical. You try to look for a job if you don't have the Internet. Try to apply for a government benefit if you don't have access to the Internet. It's essentially impossible these days. And so I think it's a really noble cause that is there to build access some of the remotest areas of our country, so that all people can have equal access to high-speed, low-latency Internet and all what comes along with that. And we're very happy to play our part in that, and to benefit from that over the long term.And this temporary pause that is going on right now, I think, is just that. And we look forward over -- in the coming years as that money does necessarily get spent by governments as well as by the private sector that will be a strong participant and enabler of the broadband revolution.OperatorAnd I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks.Richard Adam NorwittWell, thank you all so much for your time today. We appreciate everybody's time on this hot summer day. And I hope it's not too late to wish all of you a nice summer. And I hope that you'll have a little bit of chance to get some downtime as we get into the end of July and August. And we look forward to speaking to all of you in the fall in just 90 days. Thanks so much.Craig A. LampoThanks, everybody.OperatorThank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.]"

Its profit forecast of 72 cents to 74 cents per share was in line with analysts' estimates.Companies involved in the defense industry have in the past year benefited from higher spending in next-generation technologies by nations across the globe amid mounting geopolitical tensions.That has helped Amphenol cushion a decline in demand from the consumer electronics market, which came under pressure due to lower spending on devices such as laptops and tablets.Amphenol, which manufactures products including sensors, antennas, cables and connectors, posted revenue of $3.05 billion for the second quarter ended June 30, compared with estimates of $2.95 billion.Its profit came in at 72 cents per share, higher than expectations of 68 cents.During the pandemic, some of Amphenol's products were used in equipment like ventilators, thermometers and monitoring assets used by the pharmaceutical industry to develop COVID-19 vaccines.(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)]"

Price and EPS Surprise  The Aaron's Company, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Aaron's Company, Inc.

Aaron’s newly acquired appliance and electronics retailer, BrandsMart, is likely to have strengthened its market position and expanded its customer base in the quarter under review.However, AAN has been witnessing high inflation and other challenging economic conditions that continue to impact its customers. Both its segments should have been impacted by continued softness in customer demand, particularly in its core product categories, including appliances, furniture and electronics, in the first half of the year.The company has been witnessing sluggishness in the Aaron’s Business segment due to smaller average lease portfolio size and lower lease renewal rate, coupled with fewer exercises of early purchase options and weak retail sales.

Although fears of the economy slipping into a recession linger, many are now confident that the worst can now be avoided and the economy will soon rebound.This saw consumer confidence jumping further in July. The Conference Board said on Jul 25 that consumer confidence jumped to 117 in July to hit its highest level in two years. The July reading also easily surpassed analysts' expectations of a reading of 112 and was also way above June's revised reading of 110.1.More importantly, consumers' expectations or the Expectations Index, which measures the outlook for business, income and labor market conditions over the upcoming six months, climbed to 88.3 in July from 80 in June. A reading of below 80 indicates a recession in the coming year.Consumer confidence is making a steady and solid rebound as inflation has eased over the past few months and the Fed's aggressive interest rate hike stance finally seems to bear fruit. The Fed increased interest rates, totaling 500 basis points, on 10 straight occasions from March 2021.June’s consumer price index (CPI) reading and retail sales data indicate that consumers continued to spend more than they did a month ago as inflation eased. CPI increased 3% in June after rising 4% in May, to hit its lowest level since March 2021. Retail sales also grew 0.2%, indicating that people are spending more due to cooling commodity prices.The central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged in June for the first time after 15 months but Fed officials are expected to go for a 25-basis point rate hike on Jul 26. Even then, confidence among Americans is high as they believe that this could be the last of the hikes before the Fed ends its current monetary tightening cycle.Moreover, the U.S. labor market is still resilient, adding to household confidence. The economy added 209,000 jobs in June, while annual hourly wages increased 4.4%.Story continuesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in consumer discretionary stocks.Our ChoicesTherefore, from an investment perspective, we have identified five stocks from this sector that are likely to capitalize on the rebound in consumer confidence.

339,17c62a01-86ea-3e77-a8e3-c0566e61adf5,VZ,2023-07-27,Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-nyse-vz-reinvesting-120106892.html,1690459266,STORY,['VZ'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Verizon Communications:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.094 = US$31b ÷ (US$380b - US$51b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Telecom industry average of 6.9%. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Verizon Communications compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Verizon Communications.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Verizon Communications doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 9.4%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesIn Conclusion...Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Verizon Communications' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 16% in the last five years. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.Like most companies, Verizon Communications does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.02%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.23%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.12%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 9.08% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.63% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.14% in that time.Nvidia will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 23, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $2.06 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 303.92%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $11.02 billion, up 64.35% from the prior-year quarter.NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.79 per share and revenue of $42.78 billion.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.3%.Revenues are expected to be $69.91 billion, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.77% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McKesson?For McKesson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McKesson would post earnings of $7.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.19, delivering a surprise of +0.42%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McKesson appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Don't Ignore These 2 Medical Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130007714.html,1690376407,STORY,"['MRNA', 'MCK']","[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Moderna (MRNA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 eight days from its next quarterly earnings release on August 3, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$3.61 a share.Moderna's Earnings ESP sits at 5.9%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$3.61 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$3.84.MRNA is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is McKesson (MCK).McKesson, which is readying to report earnings on August 2, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.96 a share, and MCK is seven days out from its next earnings report.For McKesson, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.85 is 1.93%.Story continuesMRNA and MCK's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence And The Stock MarketThe stock market has been through a lot in the past few years, what with geopolitical tensions, interest rates and inflation, and a pandemic to boot, all being fast on its tail. Despite these significant challenges, the markets have managed to bounce back in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 having risen by 1.47 points or 0.032%, the Nasdaq Composite rising by 27.49 points or 0.20%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average being up by 2.51 points or 0.007%, all on July 24. The success of the markets has largely been based on a larger narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), specifically generative AI and other similar technology. Considering the wide-ranging impact of AI on the markets, investors and finance-minded individuals, in general, are looking at this technology as a way to make the most money they can while they still have the chance.On July 10, CNBC quoted Matt Higgins, a self-made millionaire and the CEO of investment firm RSE Ventures, as commenting that ""AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history."" According to Higgins, this technology has no regard for an individual's background or anything else, giving the global public a chance to try their own hand at making money without any barriers holding them back. Higgins is also not the only person to believe in AI as a money-making technology, as people all across the world are becoming engaged in things like freelancing and entrepreneurship with the help of AI today. At the same time, investors are considering this technology as the turning point in the business journeys of many companies. AI is presenting all sorts of possibilities to a variety of companies today, allowing them to innovate and come up with different products and services that can get them back in demand with consumers and investors alike. This is why many stocks that have remained under the radar for investors for a long time are now beginning to make a name for themselves again.Story continuesHow Are Overlooked Stocks Playing The AI Boom?Many companies, like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), have been using AI to their advantage. These moves have started to garner support for these companies in light of their stellar financial profiles and their efforts to play the AI boom in their favor. Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), for instance, has been using AI to track plants across different weather, soil types, and sun exposure to see the impact of these different conditions on plants for its agricultural operations. The company's latest earnings report from the second quarter also showed that it beat EPS estimates by $1.18 with its $9.65 EPS, while its revenue of $16.08 billion also beat estimates by $1.21 billion. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) has a similar story with a $9.38 EPS in the first quarter beating estimates by $0.18, and revenues of $26.74 billion, also beating estimates by $344.84 million, while the company is also engaged in AI operations.Stocks like these have solid profiles, and their recent ventures in the AI space are making professionals consider them to be some of the best under-the-radar stocks to buy if you're looking to pick up stocks that can play the AI boom. Considering the immense growth potential companies like these seem to have, they may even be considered to be some of the best undervalued stocks to buy now or some of the top undervalued stocks in the S&amp;P 500 overall. Keeping this in mind, we have compiled a list of 11 such stocks below.11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe first picked 25 stocks named by other sources online as some of the top under-the-radar stocks on the market today.

Their total stake value in the company was $2.2 billion.Here's what LVS Advisory said about Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also modestly added to our position in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in the mid-$70s. We initiated our Interactive Brokers position last summer and published a write-up in September 2022. Interactive Brokers continues to trade at a discounted multiple as investors are skeptical that the company will continue to sustain the current level of net interest income beyond the near future. However, recent reports showing strength in the US economy and labor market suggest that interest rates won’t be cut in the near term. The company publishes monthly KPI metrics and investors appear to be ignoring recent strength in trading volume and margin loans. The current market environment of rising stock prices and elevated interest rates is a goldilocks environment for the company. With this last buy, we have now reached our limit of investing 10% of our portfolio at cost in the stock and can no longer increase the holding size.”7. LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:LPLA) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is the largest independent broker-dealer in the U.S. Following a strong run in 2022, the stock detracted in the quarter. The weakness was largely driven by turmoil in the banking industry after the failure of SVB, which caused investors to sour on financial stocks in general. We believe LPL is immune from most of the issues facing banks. LPL is not a bank itself, has a relatively small balance sheet, and has a low-risk, short-duration securities portfolio. The banking crisis has caused investors to take a more dovish view on the path of interest rates, which is a headwind to LPL’s earnings as the economics on a large portion of client cash is tied to floating rates. However, we believe the company has an attractive growth profile even in a lower interest rate environment.”6. Expedia Group, Inc.

357,af2cd84b-fff7-3538-b733-1c07235f9ccb,CHRW,2023-07-27,Analysts Estimate C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-c-h-robinson-140221611.html,1690380141,STORY,"['CHRW', 'MATX']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis trucking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -66.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.65 billion, down 31.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.88% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for C.H. Robinson?For C.H. Robinson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that C.H. Robinson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that C.H. Robinson would post earnings of $1.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.98, delivering a surprise of -2.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.C.H. Robinson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerMatson (MATX), another stock in the Zacks Transportation - Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.26 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -76.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $774.89 million, down 38.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Matson has been revised 34.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Matson will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at $1.13 and $4.35 billion, respectively.For the second quarter, the consensus estimate for BWA’s earnings per share has moved south by a cent in the past seven days. Its bottom-line estimates imply a rise of 7.6% from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 15.8%.Over the trailing four quarters, BWA surpassed earnings estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 15.32%. This is depicted in the graph below:BorgWarner Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBorgWarner Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBorgWarner Inc. price-eps-surprise | BorgWarner Inc. QuoteQ1 HighlightsIn the first quarter of 2023, BWA reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, up from $1.05 recorded in the prior-year quarter, but it fell short of the consensus metric of $1.13.The company reported net sales of $4,180 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,214 million. The top line, however, moved up 7.9% year over year.Things to NoteBorgWarner is on track to achieve more than $5.6 billion in revenues by 2025 through eProducts sales, owing to new business awards and strategic actions.The buyout of Rhombus Energy, completed in August 2022, complements BorgWarner’s existing European charging footprint and expands the firm’s portfolio in North America. The acquisition of the charging business of SSE in China will expand BorgWarner's footprint beyond Europe and North America. BWA’s strategic action and growing footprint are likely to have aided its results in the quarter under review.On the flip side, BorgWarner has been bearing the brunt of high SG&amp;A costs over the past several quarters and the trend is likely to have clipped margins in the quarter under review. The company expects a $60-$70 million increase in e-products R&amp;D investment in 2023.High research and development costs, associated with electrification-related programs and e-product growth, are likely to have limited its margins in the second quarter.Here's a sneak peek at the firm’s revenues and EBIT projections for the to-be-reported quarter.Our estimate for BorgWarner’s Air Management segment’s second-quarter sales is pegged at $1,958.5 million, suggesting a drop from $1,979 million reported in the previous quarter. EBIT from the segment is estimated at $294.1 million, suggesting a rise from $285 million recorded in the previous quarter.For the second quarter, our forecast for the Drivetrain &amp; Battery Systems segment is pegged at $1,013 million, suggesting a rise from the $955 million registered in the preceding quarter. Also, the segmental EBIT estimate of $122.5 million marks a rise from $110 million generated in the first quarter of 2023.Our forecast for the ePropulsion segment is pegged at $520 million, suggesting a rise from the $487 million registered in the previous quarter. Our estimate for loss before interest and taxes is pegged at $28.3 million, narrower than the loss of $34 million incurred in the first quarter of 2023.We estimate the Fuel System unit’s quarterly sales at $611.1 million, up from $568 million reported in the first quarter. The EBIT for the segment is pegged at $61.2 million, indicating a rise from $48 million.Our estimate for quarterly sales from the Aftermarket unit is pinned at $349.6 million, indicating a rise from $330 million recorded in the previous quarter. The EBIT for the segment stands at $54 million, indicating a rise from $45 million.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the original equipment manufacturer for the quarter to be reported as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Walt Disney:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.042 = US$7.4b ÷ (US$205b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, Walt Disney has an ROCE of 4.2%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Entertainment industry average of 9.2%. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney roceIn the above chart we have measured Walt Disney's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Walt Disney here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Walt Disney's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 18% over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Our Take On Walt Disney's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Walt Disney. However, despite the promising trends, the stock has fallen 22% over the last five years, so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. So we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the trends look encouraging.Story continuesIf you're still interested in Walt Disney it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(AP) — After years of contentious negotiations, the board of Walt Disney World's governing district now made up of Gov. Ron DeSantis appointees approved a contract for its firefighters on Wednesday and also proposed reducing property taxes.The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District voted unanimously to approve the three-year contract that covers 200 firefighters and paramedics in the Reedy Creek Professional Firefighters' Association.The contract, among other provisions, would increase wages by 5%, including raising the starting annual wage for firefighter and paramedics from $55,000 to $66,000. It also would provide $5,000 signing bonuses for workers with three or more years working for the department and $2,500 bonuses for everyone else.“This issue has been around for some time ... and there have been some contentious negotiations,” Martin Garcia, chairman of the oversight district's board, said at a meeting. “We feel this is a fair, generous and fiscally responsible agreement.”The old contract expired more than four years ago, and the firefighters declared themselves at an impasse last year with the district’s board when it was still controlled by Disney supporters. Members of the firefighters union have warned for years that they are understaffed, adding that posed a public safety risk as the central Florida theme park resort grows bigger.The firefighters were among the few employees who publicly welcomed the takeover of the Disney World governing board by DeSantis appointees earlier this year after haggling over a contract for years with a board controlled by Disney supporters. But a delay this summer in approving the contract had threatened that support.“We were able to get it wrapped up,"" union official Aaron Colburn told reporters after the meeting.Glenton Gilzean, the district's new administrator, said at Wednesday's meeting that the district's new budget would cut property taxes by nearly 7%. The cut was made possible by cost savings, including deciding to no longer pay overtime for deputies used exclusively to patrol Disney property, an amount that had grown to $8 million, district officials said.Story continuesThe DeSantis appointees took over the Disney World governing board earlier this year following a yearlong feud between the company and the Florida governor. The fight began last year after Disney, beset by significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But before the new board came in, the company made agreements with previous oversight board members made up of Disney supporters that stripped the new supervisors of their authority over design and construction.Disney sued DeSantis and the five-member board, asking a federal judge to void the governor’s takeover of the theme park district, as well as the oversight board’s actions, on grounds that they were violations of company’s free speech rights.The board sued Disney in state court in an effort to maintain its control of construction and design at Disney World. Disney asked a judge almost two weeks ago to dismiss the case, and a decision is still pending.Board members on Wednesday met behind closed doors to discuss the lawsuits.DeSantis has touted his yearlong feud with Disney in his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, often accusing the entertainment giant of being too “woke.”___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

To skip our detailed analysis of investing moves today, you can go directly to see the 5 Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love.Investing in stocks will always be a tricky exercise. The market is plagued with high volatility, especially in times of economic crisis with the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and high inflation. Many industries and companies have been feeling the heat turned on by the Fed as a result. In these market conditions, many investors are opting to play it safe rather than be left sorry, as they continue to be wary of stocks and sectors that have either been performing poorly over the past couple of years or those that have the potential to be beaten back in the face of a rapidly transforming market with everchanging trends. At the same time, billionaires and investors in the US are making their own moves as they track the market to pick the best time to cash in their shares and turn a profit.Latest Insider TradesOn July 11, CNBC's Robert Frank reported the latest moves made by top billionaires and CEOs in this market. He noted that during the first half of 2023, about $9 billion worth of shares had been sold by these individuals. They included the Waltons, the family behind Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), who had sold shares of the company worth $4.39 billion year-to-date as of July 11. Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), also cashed in his company's shares worth $893 million year-to-date. Oracle Corporation's (NASDAQ:ORCL) CTO, Larry Ellison, also added another $848 million to his wealth by cashing in the company's shares. Safra Catz, the CEO of Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), also cashed in $470 million by selling her company's shares at a prime moment. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) also saw its CEO selling its shares worth $302 million during the first half of the year. Finally, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) also joined the selling frenzy, making about $210 million with his sale of the company's stock.Story continuesAccording to Frank, this flurry of insider selling has been primarily motivated by questions of valuation. He noted that many of the stocks in question above saw 52-week highs at the start of the year, making this an opportune moment to get out of the trade and make a profit. Yet while the market is seeing many stocks such as these performing at record high levels, there are also many companies whose stocks have been taking a hit during this year. One example is Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), a stock that is down by 8.65% over the past year as of July 14. This stock has been continuing a downward spiral for the past five years, over which period it has fallen by 49.40%. Other well-known stocks that have fallen out of favor over the past few years include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the former being down by 3.54% over the past year and 20.53% over the past five years, while the latter is down by 17.61% over the past five years.What Are Hedge Funds Up To?Many factors are responsible for the worrying performance of these reputable companies, and some would assume that this performance would result in investors and hedge funds alike fleeing their positions in them. However, we have seen over the first quarter that numerous hedge funds have continued to stick by these stocks despite their poor performance, leading one to think twice before they abandon their stakes in these companies. This seems to imply that hedge funds today may be betting on companies such as the one mentioned above in the long run in hopes of making back their money and perhaps even turning a profit at the end of their trade. Considering this, we have compiled a list of 12 stocks that have similarly been performing poorly enough to lose the support of the broader market but have managed to retain the confidence of the hedge funds investing in them. Some may argue that several of these stocks are even some of the best undervalued stocks to buy today or some of the top cheap undervalued stocks on the market.12 Out of Favor Stocks that Hedge Funds LoveOur MethodologyWe first listed down all large-cap stocks that have fallen significantly in value over the past 24 months. From these stocks, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors according to Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love12. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Two-year performance: -76.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a communication services company also operating digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses.

Sea declined due to rising investor concerns around e-commerce competition from TikTok in Southeast Asia during a period of subdued gross merchandise value growth, while the gaming business continues to struggle.”11. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Two-year performance: -52.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Chiodo holds a Neutral rating on Shopify Inc.

Their total stake value in the company was $2.5 billion.Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is an information technology company providing and e-commerce platform and services. It is based in Ottawa, Canada.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP): Shopify shares were a top contributor in the quarter as the market focused on the company’s recent price increases and its ongoing market share gains in e-commerce gross merchandise volumes (GMV). Earlier in the quarter the company reported better-than-expected 4Q results, with 26% revenue growth and $248 million of FCF (at a 14% margin), significantly better than the Street consensus of -$109 million.Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels. We believe that the overall growth of e-commerce, combined with the development of new products and services, such as its digital wallet Shop Pay and its pick, pack and ship Shopify Fulfillment Network, should continue to drive revenue growth of about 20% per year over the next several years, accompanied by re-acceleration of operating margin growth and FCF generation.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a stock that has managed to retain its popularity with hedge funds despite its recent performance.10. Pinterest, Inc.

The company posted better-than-expected third quarter results and forward guidance was in line with Street estimates. Pinterest expects significant margin improvement after a relatively heavy investment cycle.”9. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Two-year performance: -15.26%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a biotechnology company working on neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and their treatments.

(NYSE:FIS) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio holdings most directly impacted by the bank failures of the first quarter were Charles Schwab and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), both top detractors for the quarter. Banking software provider FIS’s shares were also collateral damage as investors looked to shed any exposure to the small and regional banks that FIS serves. This, after several quarters of underwhelming operating results, lands FIS as our top detractor for the fiscal year period as well. Our FIS experience has been disappointing to be sure. But having re-underwritten our investment thesis and lowered our business value estimate, we believe investors have exacted too steep a penalty on FIS shares. From this lowered price, we are optimistic that new management can reestablish credibility with investors and unlock value through the planned separation of the banking software and merchant services businesses.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a stock that many elite hedge funds are piling into this year.7.

370,5f7aa44e-6144-3c8d-b6ac-2af7e32ef9a4,EXC,2023-07-27,Exelon (EXC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exelon-exc-expected-beat-earnings-140218128.html,1690380138,STORY,['ES'],"[Exelon (EXC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.8%.Revenues are expected to be $4.4 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.44% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon?For Exelon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Exelon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of $0.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering a surprise of +6.06%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Exelon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Eversource Energy (ES) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.87 billion, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Eversource has been revised 1.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.55%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Eversource will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by increased interest rates and rising operating costs. Further, cost management, customer growth, systematic investment to strengthen infrastructure to increase the resilience of the system and new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.With the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four utilities, namely Exelon Corporation EXC, Consolidated Edison ED, Public Service Enterprise Group PEG and Atmos Energy ATO, which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Utilities sector’s second-quarter earnings started on a positive note, with NextEra Energy reporting an earnings surprise.Factors That Likely Impacted PerformancesDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are concentrating on cost management and the implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand, and assisting the utilities. Investments in strengthening the infrastructure are allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations. The performances of the utilities are likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities continue to invest smart capital that assists in cutting operating and maintenance expenses, and fuel costs, in turn, keeping the utility bills affordable for customers.Utilities have been adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios. Weather in the second quarter was mild and adversely impacted the use per customer during the quarter.Story continuesExpected OutperformersExelon is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity.

T reported relatively healthy second-quarter 2023 results as solid wireless traction and customer additions was partially offset by lower demand for legacy voice and data services. The company recorded solid subscriber growth backed by a resilient business model and robust cash flow position driven by a diligent execution of operational plans. AT&amp;T expects to continue investing in key areas of 5G and fiber and adjust its business according to the evolving market scenario to fuel long-term growth, while maintaining a healthy dividend payment and actively pruning debt.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, AT&amp;T reported net income of $4,437 million or 61 cents per share compared with $4,105 million or 57 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant year-over-year rise was primarily attributable to top-line growth and lower operating expenses.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share compared with 65 cents in the year-earlier quarter.

QuoteQuarter DetailsQuarterly GAAP operating revenues increased 0.9% year over year to $29,917 million, largely due to higher Mobility, Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by lower revenues from Business Wireline services. The top line missed the consensus mark of $30,087 million.Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $6,395 million compared with $5,897 million in the prior-year quarter. This resulted in respective adjusted operating income margins of 21.4% and 16.7%. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $11,053 million from $10,330 million.AT&amp;T witnessed solid subscriber momentum with 464,000 post-paid net additions.

Postpaid phone-only average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 1.5% year over year to $55.63 due to improved international roaming and shift to higher-priced unlimited plans. AT&amp;T is currently covering 175 million people with mid-band 5G spectrum, while its nationwide 5G is reaching out to more than 290 million people.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceCommunications: Total segment operating revenues were up to $28,845 million from $28,695 million as decline in Business Wireline (down 5.6% to $5,279 million) was offset by a gain in the Mobility business (up 2% to $20,315 million) and Consumer Wireline (up 2.4% to $3,251 million). However, the segment revenues fell short of our estimates of $29,160.8 million.Service revenues from the Mobility unit improved 4.9% to $15,745 million driven by solid subscriber gains, while equipment revenues declined 7.2% year over year to $4,570 million driven by lower volumes owing to challenging macroeconomic environment. Revenues from Consumer Wireline business were up due to gain in fiber broadband. AT&amp;T recorded net fiber additions of 251,000 and has the ability to serve 20.2 million consumer and more than 3 million business customer locations in more than 100 U.S. metro areas with fiber. Revenues from Business Wireline were down due to decline in legacy products as customers shifted to more advanced IP-based offerings.Segment operating income was $7,177 million compared with $6,683 million in the year-ago quarter for respective operating margin of 24.9% and 23.3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $11,490 million compared with $10,798 million in the year-ago quarter.Latin America: Total operating revenues were $967 million, up 19.7% year over year, due to growth in service and equipment revenues driven by favorable currency impact and higher sales.

As of Jun 30, 2023, AT&amp;T had $9,528 million of cash and cash equivalents with long-term debt of $128,012 million. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was about 3.1x.Moving ForwardWhile optimizing operations, AT&amp;T is aiming to increase efficiencies to lower operating costs, while focusing on 5G and fiber-based connectivity along with expanded reach of software-based entertainment platforms. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to be in the vicinity of $16 billion due to cost savings. The company is also aiming to reduce its debt burden by monetizing non-core assets.

(NYSE: HP) reported net income of $95 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $724 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to net income of $164 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $769 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The net income per diluted share for the third and second quarters of fiscal 2023 include $(0.16) and $0.29 of after-tax losses and gains, respectively, comprised of select items(1). For the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, select items were comprised of:Story continues$0.05 of non-cash after-tax gains related to the change in estimates of certain liabilities$(0.21) of after-tax losses related to the non-cash change in the fair value of certain contingent liabilities, the sales of rigs and related equipment that were held for sale and the scrapping of excess equipment, and non-cash fair market adjustments to our equity investmentsNet cash provided by operating activities was $293 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which included $37 million in tax payments, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $141 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, which included $114 million in tax payments.President and CEO John Lindsay commented, ""H&amp;P's financial results for the third fiscal quarter were significant for a few reasons. First, they demonstrate that we are achieving economic returns in the low-to-mid teens which are just above of our cost of capital. Second, these financial results were achieved during a period when rig activity was declining primarily due to weak natural gas prices, so our emphasis on contract economics rather than market share drove the Company's financial performance this quarter. Finally, the results reflect a behavioral change that has transpired broadly within the energy industry, and is guided by fiscal prudence and capital allocation.""Uncertainty around the macro-outlook for crude oil and natural gas prices maintained an underlying sense of apprehension in the U.S. drilling market during the quarter. Recently however, some of this uncertainty has receded, and we are starting to see signs of optimism on the horizon. In the near term, we believe that U.S. rig activity declines will likely continue into the September ended quarter, albeit at a more modest pace than experienced thus far this calendar year. These declines appear to be more of a function of customer budget and production discipline rather than a reaction to short-term commodity price movements. For the quarter ending in December, we expect to see an increase in contracting activity as our customers refresh their capital budgets for 2024, and we have already received indications they may increase activity. Looking forward into the medium to longer term, we believe there will be an increase in the demand for rigs relative to current levels due to fundamental supply and demand dynamics inherent in the industry.""In the face of recent rig count declines, we have been able to remain firm on our contractual economics by working with customers on alternative contracting models, such as performance contracts. Having the operational confidence in our ability to consistently execute enables H&amp;P to enter into alternative contractual arrangements, which can result in win-win economics for both the customer and H&amp;P. Even with these ongoing efforts, we are anticipating our NAS margins in the fourth fiscal quarter to regress slightly as the rigs idled during the second half of our fiscal year have been mainly in the spot market and had contractual margins above the overall average. The absence of those rigs and their associated margins will contribute to, what we believe will be, a nominal decline for NAS margins in the upcoming quarter. We anticipate this decline will be transitory based on expectations for rig additions and some term contract rollovers benefiting margins in the December ended quarter.""Expanding our international footprint remains a core strategy for the Company, although one that is unfolding at a slower pace which is typical in international markets compared to the U.S. Our rig in Australia is scheduled to commence drilling soon, and we look forward to demonstrating our expertise in drilling efficiencies and providing value-added drilling solutions to our customer. Additionally, we are sending a second rig to the Middle East in anticipation of hearing results regarding our participation in a recent tender. Activities in our other international markets look to remain relatively steady for the foreseeable future.""Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, ""Macro-economic issues experienced earlier this calendar year lingered during our third fiscal quarter and were reflected at the company level by a declining rig count. Notwithstanding, the Company kept the focus on generating economic returns despite this market backdrop and executing our capital allocation strategy, including the 2023 Supplemental Shareholder Return Plan. In addition to the planned base and supplemental dividends during the third fiscal quarter, we continued to opportunistically repurchase shares. Specifically, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares for roughly $103 million in the fiscal quarter, bringing the total fiscal 2023 year-to-date share repurchases to approximately 6.5 million shares for roughly $249 million, representing approximately 6% of the shares outstanding.""Looking ahead, we are still very early in the process of establishing our fiscal 2024 capital budget, but preliminary estimates suggest our fiscal 2024 budget will be at least at this year's level considering fiscal 2023 capex deferrals, projected maintenance capex and walking rig conversions. When completed, the budget will serve as a basis for determining and refreshing our shareholder return plans for fiscal 2024. Flexibility, not only with capital allocation within a fiscal year, but from one year to the next, were important components of the inaugural design of the Company's supplemental shareholder return plan. As such, we expect the plan for fiscal 2024 will be developed taking into consideration various factors, some of which may be the same or different from those used to establish the plan for fiscal 2023.""John Lindsay concluded, ""We remain optimistic that the political and economic uncertainty over the past several quarters impacting the global crude oil and natural gas markets is indeed abating. During the third fiscal quarter, we once again achieved returns in excess of our cost of capital and moving forward, our focus will remain on maintaining these levels of returns by delivering better well economic outcomes for our customers. This level of performance is possible because of the service attitude of our people and their ability to deliver value through drilling efficiencies and technology in collaboration with our customers.""Operating Segment Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023North America Solutions:This segment had operating income of $169.5 million compared to operating income of $182.1 million during the previous quarter. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decline in activity levels during the quarter, which also caused direct margin(2) to decrease by $19.2 million to $276.9 million sequentially. Despite the absolute decreases in operating income and direct margin(2), revenue per day and direct margin(2) per day showed sequential increases quarter over quarter.International Solutions:This segment had an operating loss of $1.4 million compared to operating income of $4.0 million during the previous quarter. The decline in operating income was mainly due a lower active rig count and the associated direct margins(2). Direct margin(2) during the third fiscal quarter was $3.3 million compared to $8.6 million during the previous quarter.Offshore Gulf of Mexico:This segment had operating income of $4.7 million compared to operating income of $6.7 million during the previous quarter. Direct margin(2) for the quarter was $7.3 million compared to $9.3 million in the prior quarter as a rig demobilized as expected.Operational Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023North America Solutions:We expect North America Solutions direct margins(2) to be between $230-$250 millionWe expect to exit the quarter between approximately 141-147 contracted rigsInternational Solutions:We expect International Solutions direct margins(2) to be between $8.0-$11.0 million, exclusive of any foreign exchange gains or lossesOffshore Gulf of Mexico:We expect Offshore Gulf of Mexico direct margins(2) to be between $6.0-$8.0 millionOther Estimates for Fiscal Year 2023Gross capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $400 million, exclusive of ongoing asset sales that include reimbursements for lost and damaged tubulars and sales of other used drilling equipment that offset a portion of the gross capital expenditures and are now expected to total approximately $70 million in fiscal year 2023Depreciation for fiscal year 2023 is now expected to be approximately $385 millionResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2023 are still expected to be roughly $30 millionGeneral and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2023 are still expected to be approximately $205 millionCash taxes for fiscal year 2023 are now expected to be approximately $180-$205 million, of which $156 million has been paid through June 30, 2023Select Items(1) Included in Net Income per Diluted ShareThird quarter of fiscal year 2023 net income of $0.93 per diluted share included $(0.16) in after-tax losses comprised of the following:$0.05 of non-cash after-tax gains related to the change in estimates of certain liabilities$(0.03) of non-cash after-tax losses related to the change in the fair value of certain contingent liabilities$(0.04) of after-tax losses related to the sales of rigs and related equipment that were held for sale and the scrapping of excess equipment$(0.14) of non-cash after-tax losses related to fair market value adjustments to equity investmentsSecond quarter of fiscal year 2023 net income of $1.55 per diluted share included $0.29 in after-tax gains comprised of the following:$0.29 of non-cash after-tax gains related to fair market value adjustments to equity investmentsConference CallA conference call will be held on Thursday, July 27, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) with John Lindsay, President and CEO, Mark Smith, Senior Vice President and CFO, and Dave Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations, to discuss the Company’s third quarter fiscal year 2023 results.

Select items are excluded as they are deemed to be outside the Company's core business operations. See Non-GAAP Measurements.(2) Direct margin, which is considered a non-GAAP metric, is defined as operating revenues (less reimbursements) less direct operating expenses (less reimbursements) and is included as a supplemental disclosure. We believe it is useful in assessing and understanding our current operational performance, especially in making comparisons over time. See Non-GAAP Measurements for a reconciliation of segment operating income(loss) to direct margin. Expected direct margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is provided on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to calculate the most comparable GAAP measure is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the future financial statement impact of certain items. Therefore, as a result of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future items and adjustments, which could be significant, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of expected direct margin to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort.(3) During the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023, H&amp;P repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares for roughly $103 million;

The Company considers segment operating income (loss) to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company’s core businesses. This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods. The Company believes that segment operating income (loss) is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, segment operating income (loss) has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company’s operating performance in future periods.The following table reconciles operating income (loss) per the information above to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:Three Months EndedNine Months EndedJune 30,March 31,June 30,June 30,June 30,(in thousands)20232023202220232022Operating income (loss)North America Solutions$169,499$182,149$57,353$496,945$29,757International Solutions(1,397)3,955(6,550)4,132651Offshore Gulf of Mexico4,7056,6875,87218,13816,616Other2,1046,8231,96513,6049,061Eliminations4,470(2,267)(2,140)4,513(5,453)Segment operating income$179,381$197,347$56,500$537,332$50,632Gain on reimbursement of drilling equipment10,64211,5749,89537,94021,597Other gain (loss) on sale of assets(4,504)2,5193,0753942,762Corporate selling, general and administrative costs, corporate depreciation and corporate restructuring charges(36,777)(36,235)(35,748)(107,496)(106,497)Operating income (loss)$148,742$175,205$33,722$468,170$(31,506)Other income (expense):Interest and dividend income10,7485,0555,31320,50811,301Interest expense(4,324)(4,239)(4,372)(12,918)(14,876)Gain (loss) on investment securities(18,538)39,752(14,310)6,12355,684Loss on extinguishment of debt————(60,083)Other(685)(743)(1,148)(2,088)(2,166)Total unallocated amounts(12,799)39,825(14,517)11,625(10,140)Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes$135,943$215,030$19,205$479,795$(41,646)SUPPLEMENTARY STATISTICAL INFORMATIONUnauditedU.S. LAND RIG COUNTS &amp; MARKETABLE FLEET STATISTICSJuly 26,June 30,March 31,Q3FY23202320232023AverageU.S. Land OperationsTerm Contract Rigs939510199Spot Contract Rigs56587867Total Contracted Rigs149153179166Idle or Other Rigs84805467Total Marketable Fleet233233233233H&amp;P GLOBAL FLEET UNDER TERM CONTRACT STATISTICSNumber of Rigs Already Under Long-Term Contracts(*)(Estimated Quarterly Average — as of 6/30/23)Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2SegmentFY23FY24FY24FY24FY24FY25FY25U.S. Land Operations90.778.344.739.728.313.26.4International Land Operations8.78.06.05.73.63.02.4Offshore Operations——————Total99.486.350.745.431.916.28.8(*) All of the above rig contracts have original terms equal to or in excess of six months and include provisions for early termination fees.NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTSNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION OF SELECT ITEMS AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME(**)Three Months Ended June 30, 2023(in thousands, except per share data)PretaxTaxNetEPSNet income (GAAP basis)$95,293$0.93(-) Fair market adjustment to equity investments$(18,548)$(4,419)$(14,129)$(0.14)(-) Loss related to the sale of rigs and related equipment$(6,025)$(1,555)$(4,470)$(0.04)(-) Change in the fair value of contingent liabilities$(4,050)$(1,045)$(3,005)$(0.03)(-) Change in estimates of certain liabilities$6,396$1,650$4,746$0.05Adjusted net income$112,151$1.09Three Months Ended March 31, 2023(in thousands, except per share data)PretaxTaxNetEPSNet income (GAAP basis)$164,040$1.55(-) Fair market adjustment to equity investments$39,583$9,755$29,828$0.29Adjusted net income$134,212$1.26(**)The Company believes identifying and excluding select items is useful in assessing and understanding current operational performance, especially in making comparisons over time involving previous and subsequent periods and/or forecasting future period results.

Direct margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is useful in assessing and understanding our current operational performance, especially in making comparisons over time.

FFIV shares closed 5.8% higher on Tuesday after the cloud security company reported impressive third-quarter fiscal 2023 results. The company’s latest quarterly performance reflected the improving demand for its software solutions, which had been hurt by tightened IT spending amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainties for the past few quarters.Software Demand Highlights PositivityThough the F5 Software segment’s revenues declined 2.8% year over year to $174 million, it grew 32% sequentially. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the division’s revenues had fallen 13% year over year and 21.3% sequentially to $131.9 million due to customers’ tight budgets amid macroeconomic uncertainties. Third-quarter Software sales were also higher than the first-quarter level of $167.5 million.Within the Software segment, F5’s Subscription Software sales increased 4% year over year and reached a record high of $152 million. Strong growth in renewals, stabilization in new-term subscriptions and interim expansions mainly aided Subscription Software’s revenue growth.The acceleration in BIG-IP and NGINX subscription software deals remained a major growth driver during the quarter. BIG-IP’s data point performance, automation capabilities and the lower cost of ownership helped F5 win multiple deals in the third quarter, including wins at a major American airline, a major UK retail and commercial bank and a multi-national automobile manufacturer.F5 also witnessed the strong demand for its NGINX subscription as large enterprises continue to adopt the solution for their cloud and Kubernetes workloads. During the last reported quarter, the company struck a multi-million-dollar term-based subscription renewal for its NGINX solution.F5, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseF5, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | F5, Inc. QuoteQ3 Result HighlightsIn the third quarter, F5 managed to fare better than its guidance ranges for key metrics. The company’s revenues for the third quarter increased 4.2% year over year to $702.6 million and came well above the midpoint of management’s guidance range of $690-$710 million. However, the top line was slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $703.2 million.Story continuesThe company’s third-quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 82.5% was higher than management’s forecast of approximately 82%, while non-GAAP operating expenses of $346 million came in lower than the guidance range of $348-$360 million.This Seattle, WA-based company’s non-GAAP earnings of $3.21 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.86. The bottom line increased 24.9% from the year-ago quarter’s $2.57 per share and was way higher than management’s guided range of $2.78-$2.90 per share.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderF5 currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on F5's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for F5 How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for F5 is:12% = US$332m ÷ US$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of F5's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, F5 seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 11%. However, while F5 has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 9.5% . Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesHowever, when we compared F5's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 34% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for FFIV? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is F5 Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?F5 doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.SummaryOverall, we feel that F5 certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

The move sparked some profit taking in oil markets, amid concerns that high interest rates will pressure crude demand.But the Fed also signaled that the U.S. may not see a recession this year - a scenario that bodes well for oil demand, especially if local economic activity recovers from recent lulls.This notion, coupled with a drop in the dollar following the Fed decision, helped support oil prices.Brent oil futures rose 0.9% to $83.33 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 1% to $79.53 a barrel by 22:07 ET (02:07 GMT). Both contracts were now once again close to three-month highs.Oil buoyed by tighter supply outlookOil prices are expected to increase in the coming months, tracking tightness in global markets following supply cuts by the world’s largest producers.Saudi Arabia and Russia both recently signaled lower production levels for August, with analysts expecting the supply cuts to potentially stretch into end-September.The prospect of weaker supply helped offset a series of soft readings on U.S. inventories, with data on Wednesday showing that U.S. crude stockpiles shrank less than expected in the week to July 21.But U.S. gasoline inventories contracted for a fourth straight week, while gasoline production also weakened more than expected, indicating that fuel demand in the world’s largest oil consumer remained steady.Promises of more stimulus measures in China also buoyed oil prices this week, on hopes that fuel demand in the world’s largest oil importer will recover from COVID-era lows,Story continuesMore rate hike risks on tapBeyond the Fed, focus this week is also on central bank meetings in Europe and Japan.The European Central Bank is widely expected to hike rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, and could signal more rate hikes due to sticky euro zone inflation.The Bank of Japan is expected to keep rates at ultra-low levels. But some traders are positioning for a potentially hawkish surprise from the central bank, given that Japanese inflation has also remained sticky in recent months.Related ArticlesOil prices rebound tracking weak dollar, tighter supply outlookOil up as supply tightness view offsets concerns from rate hikesGold prices rise as dollar dips after Fed hikes rates]"
384,8bdc753f-8354-3d50-9a0c-37efff679e5a,CL,2023-07-27,"Oil down first time in a week as U.S. draws disappoint, Fed hawkish",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-down-first-time-week-155103302.html,1690386663,STORY,"['UCO', 'CL', 'NYF', 'SCO', 'HO=F', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com -- The oil market has thrown its own wrench into the crude rally after disappointing U.S. inventory draws last week.The Federal Reserve’s resumption of a hawkish stance with a quarter point rate hike for July — versus June’s pause — also put crude prices on the backfoot.New York-based West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, for delivery in September settled down 85 cents, or 1.1%, at $78.78 a barrel. In the previous session, the U.S. crude hit a three-month high of $79.90. Even with Wednesday’s slide, WTI was up more than 2% for the current week and poised to end July up almost 12%.London-based Brent for October delivery settled down 72 cents, or 0.9%, at $82.92 per barrel after surging to an April high of $83.88 on Tuesday. The global crude benchmark was up 1.7% on the week and about 10% on the month.Wednesday’s reversal in crude prices came after government data showed U.S. crude inventories fell by just a quarter of expected levels last week despite an end to supply injections from the national reserve.Fuel inventories also fell less than expected for the week ended July 21, the Weekly Petroleum Status Report from the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, showed, raising questions about demand in a summer travel period that should logically see large draws.The U.S. crude inventory balance fell by 0.6 million barrels during the week ended July 21, versus the 2.348M-barrel decline forecast by industry analysts polled by local media. In the week to July 14, crude stockpiles slid by 0.708M barrels after a build of 5.946M the prior week — the most in a month.Interestingly, the weak crude draw reported by the EIA did not come with what had been the market’s caveat for months — release of crude from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Prior to this, weekly drawdowns from the reserve had been a point of contention for oil bulls, who said the additional oil had often suppressed crude prices from rallying. The so-called SPR draws stopped two weeks ago. With just days to the end of July, both US crude and Brent oil prices are carrying a 12% gain on the month, on the notion of high oil demand.Story continuesThe lower-than-expected crude draw for last week also came on the back of the million-barrel-per-day production cut announced by the Saudis for all of July.On the gasoline inventory side, the EIA reported a draw of 0.786M barrels for last week. Analysts had expected the agency to cite a decline of 1.678M barrels instead, after a drop of 1.066M the prior week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 US fuel product.Finished motor gasoline products delivered to the marketplace — an indication of demand at the pump — stood at 8.855M barrels versus the prior week’s 8.756M. Typically, at this time of year, more than 9.0M barrels of gasoline or more are supplied to the market each week.In the case of distillate stockpiles, the EIA reported a drop of 0.245M barrels. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.301M barrels last week, against a previous build of 0.014M.

Both gasoline and distillate balances dropped less than forecast, raising questions about demand in a summer travel period that should logically see large draws.The U.S. crude inventory balance fell by 0.6M barrels during the week ended July 21, versus the 2.348M-barrel decline forecast by industry analysts tracked by Investing.com. In the prior week to July 14, crude stockpiles slid by 0.708M barrels after a build of 5.946M the prior week — the most in a month.Interestingly, the weak crude draw reported by the EIA did not come with what had been the market’s caveat for months — release of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Prior to this, weekly drawdowns from the reserve had been a point of contention for oil bulls, who said the additional oil had often suppressed crude prices from rallying. The so-called SPR draws stopped two weeks ago, leaving open the question of whom those long oil would blame if crude prices drop hereon. With just days to the conclusion of July, both U.S. crude and Brent are carrying a 12% gain on the month — all on the notion that demand for oil would just fly.The lower-than-expected crude draw for last week also came on the back of the much ballyhooed million-barrel-per-day production cut supposedly carried out by the Saudis for all of July — again raising questions on who would bear blame for poor market optics.On the gasoline inventory side, the EIA reported a draw of 0.786M barrels for last week. Analysts had expected the agency to cite a decline of 1.678M barrels instead, after a drop of 1.066M the prior week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.Story continuesFinished motor gasoline products delivered to the marketplace — an indication of demand at the pump — was at 8.939M, higher than the previous week's 8.855M, but still below the seasonal norm, which sees 9.5M barrels of gasoline or more supplied to the market each week.In the case of distillate stockpiles, the EIA reported a draw of 0.245M barrels. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.301M barrels last week, against a previous build of 0.014M.

(NYSE:JNPR) By 27%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-juniper-networks-inc-153339494.html,1690385619,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Juniper Networks fair value estimate is US$40.94Juniper Networks is estimated to be 27% undervalued based on current share price of US$29.82 Analyst price target for JNPR is US$35.74 which is 13% below our fair value estimateDoes the July share price for Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Juniper Networks The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.08bUS$1.12bUS$1.03bUS$983.5mUS$958.0mUS$946.6mUS$944.8mUS$949.5mUS$958.8mUS$971.5mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -4.61%Est @ -2.59%Est @ -1.18%Est @ -0.19%Est @ 0.50%Est @ 0.98%Est @ 1.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$994US$947US$804US$706US$633US$575US$528US$489US$454US$423(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.6bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$971m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.1%) = US$15bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$15b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$6.6bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$13b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$29.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Juniper Networks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.102. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Juniper NetworksStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as year/year basis point changes.Revenue for Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms was consistent with the prior year period. Growth in residential connectivity revenue was driven by domestic broadband revenue due to higher average rates; international connectivity revenue due to an increase in wireless revenue, reflecting higher sales of devices and wireless services, as well as an increase in broadband revenue; and domestic wireless revenue due to an increase in the number of customer lines. The growth in residential connectivity revenue was offset by a decrease in video revenue due to a decline in the number of video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates; other revenue primarily due to lower voice revenue, driven by a decline in the number of residential wireline voice customers; and advertising revenue primarily due to a decline in domestic political advertising and overall market weakness.Adjusted EBITDA for Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms increased due to lower operating expenses. Programming expenses decreased primarily due to the decline in the number of domestic video customers, partially offset by domestic contractual rate increases and an increase in programming expenses for international sports channels. Non-programming expenses decreased primarily due to lower spending on marketing and promotion, lower technical and support costs, lower fees paid to third-party channels relating to advertising sales and lower customer service costs. These decreases were partially offset by increased direct product costs associated with our wireless service, resulting from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving our wireless service.

The decrease in domestic advertising revenue was primarily due to lower revenue at our networks, partially offset by an increase in revenue at Peacock. International networks revenue increased primarily reflecting an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports channels. Domestic distribution revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue at Peacock, driven by an increase in paid subscribers, partially offset by lower revenue at our networks.Adjusted EBITDA for Media decreased primarily due to higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher programming costs at Peacock, as well as increased international sports programming costs driven by the shift of certain European football matches and the related programming expense to the first half of 2023 due to timing of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, partially offset by a decrease in content costs for our entertainment television networks.

The decrease in operating expenses reflected lower programming and production expenses, primarily due to lower costs associated with lower content licensing sales, partially offset by higher spending on recent theatrical releases.Theme Parks($ in millions)2nd Quarter20232022ChangeRevenue$2,209$1,80422.4%Operating Expenses1,3761,17317.4%Adjusted EBITDA$833$63231.8%Revenue for Theme Parks increased driven by higher revenue at our international theme parks, which had COVID-19 related restrictions in the prior year period. Domestic theme parks revenue remained consistent primarily due to higher revenue at our theme park in Hollywood driven by the opening of Super Nintendo World, offset by lower revenue at our theme park in Orlando which continues to be above pre-pandemic levels.Adjusted EBITDA for Theme Parks increased, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher costs primarily associated with increased guest attendance.Headquarters &amp; OtherContent &amp; Experiences Headquarters &amp; Other includes overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives.

Revenue eliminations were $1.4 billion, consistent with the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $14 million compared to a loss of $36 million in the prior year period.Notes:1We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.2We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure.3All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.4We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure.5Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses, Connectivity &amp; Platforms and Content &amp; Experiences. We have updated certain historical information as a result of these changes, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky's results across the Connectivity &amp; Platforms and Content &amp; Entertainment segments, and Corporate &amp; Other.6Constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. See Table 6 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.7Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships outside of the Connectivity &amp; Platforms markets.8Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of profit or loss for our segments. From time to time, we may present Adjusted EBITDA for components of our reportable segments, such as Peacock. We believe these measures are useful to evaluate our financial results and provide a basis of comparison to others, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA for components are generally presented on a consistent basis with the respective segments and include direct revenue and operating costs and expenses attributed to the component operations.Numerical information is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding.Conference Call and Other InformationComcast Corporation will host a conference call with the financial community today, July 27, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).

397,278c9572-bb6b-3951-adf9-caa84f21e692,PRU,2023-07-27,Earnings Preview: MetLife (MET) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-metlife-met-q2-140212476.html,1690380132,STORY,"['MET', 'MET-PF', 'PRU']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when MetLife (MET) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5%.Revenues are expected to be $17.19 billion, down 6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MetLife?For MetLife, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MetLife will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MetLife would post earnings of $1.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.52, delivering a surprise of -17.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MetLife doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPrudential (PRU), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.04 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +74.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $12.7 billion, down 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Prudential has been revised 1.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Prudential will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

High-quality CLOs offer one of the best relative value trades in the fixed income market today given their attractive yield potential, floating rate coupons, and credit protection in AAA tranches,"" according to Edwin Wilches, co-portfolio manager of the PGIM AAA CLO ETF. In addition to Wilches, the ETF is managed by Gabriel Rivera and Connor Byrnes.Competitively priced with a net expense ratio of 0.19%, PAAA seeks to maximize total return through a combination of current income and capital appreciation, investing primarily in U.S. CLOs rated AAA or equivalent. The Fund will invest predominantly in the senior tranches of CLOs which ordinarily have the highest ratings, the lowest level of risk and the lowest relative yields.Story continues""As we remain in a period of economic uncertainty with tighter financial conditions and corporate defaults expected to increase, high-quality CLOs have the potential to insulate an investor’s portfolio while providing diversification benefits with less idiosyncratic risk and the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns,"" Wilches added.In addition to PAAA, PGIM has also launched the PGIM Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond ETF (Cboe BZX: PSDM), which seeks to provide total return, allocating its investments across different sectors of the fixed income market with an average portfolio duration of three years or less. The fund closely mirrors the existing $2.9 billion PGIM Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund.Both the mutual fund and ETF are managed by Gregory Peters, Robert Tipp and Richard Piccirillo.""Active ETFs are one of the fastest growing segments of the ETF market today. PGIM will continue to aggressively expand its suite of products to meet this client demand by either offering new ways to access the market or expanding access to our flagship strategies,"" added Stuart Parker, president and CEO of PGIM Investments.With the addition of these new funds, PGIM Investments now offers investors 10 actively managed ETFs across fixed income, equities, and multi-asset solutions.

For more information, please visit news.prudential.com. Consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information about the fund. Contact your financial professional for a prospectus and summary prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results.Investing in mutual funds and ETFs involves risks. Some funds have more risk than others. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold may be worth more or less than the original cost and it is possible to lose money. Diversification and asset allocation do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There is no guarantee that a Fund’s objectives will be achieved. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund’s respective prospectus.Fixed income investments are subject to credit, market, and interest rate risks (including duration risk and prepayment risk), and their value will decline as interest rates rise; call and redemption risk, where the issuer may call a bond held by the Fund for redemption before it matures and the Fund may lose income; liquidity risk, which exists when particular investments are difficult to sell; and emerging markets risk, which exposes the Fund to greater volatility and price declines.The new Funds are actively managed exchange traded funds (ETFs); the Funds are subject to risks involved with: actively and frequently trading; ETF shares trading risk (including the risk of the shares trading at a premium or discount to net asset value or the lack an active trading market); authorized participant concentration risk; the risk of transacting in cash versus in-kind; as well as the risk of increased expenses and the cost of buying or selling shares through a broker. As new and relatively small funds with limited operating history, the Funds are subject to the risk that its performance might not represent how it may perform long term and investments may have disproportionate impact on performance.Large shareholders could subject the Funds to large scale redemption risk. The risks associated with the Funds are more fully explained in the prospectus and summary prospectus. These risks may increase the Funds’ share price volatility. There is no guarantee the Funds’ objective will be achieved.PGIM AAA CLO ETF FUND RISKSThe Fund invests primarily in collateralized loan obligations (""CLOs"") which are subject to credit, interest rate, valuation, and prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. CLO managers may have limited operating histories and may be subject to conflicts of interest. The Fund is subject to covenant-lite risk, which means the loans or obligations contain fewer financial maintenance covenants than other loans or obligations (in some cases, none) and do not include terms which allow the lender to monitor the borrower’s performance and declare a default if certain criteria are breached; call and redemption risk, where the issuer may call a bond held by the Fund for redemption before it matures and the Fund may lose income; market risks, including economic risks, as well as market disruption and geopolitical risks (the value of investments may decrease, and international conflicts and geopolitical developments may adversely affect the U.S. and foreign financial markets, including increased volatility); liquidity risk, which exists when particular investments are difficult to sell (loans are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale); reference rate risk, in which the Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that recently transitioned from using or continue to use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value; management risk in which the subadviser will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but the subadviser’s judgments about the attractiveness, value or market trends affecting a particular security, industry or sector or about market movements may be incorrect; and interest rate risk in which the value of your investment may go down when interest rates rise. A rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of longer term or duration debt securities. The Fund may lose money if short-term or long-term interest rates rise sharply or in a manner not anticipated by the subadviser. The Fund may invest in derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; emerging markets, which typically have economic and political systems that are less fully developed, and can be expected to be less stable, than those of more developed countries; and foreign or non-U.S. securities, which are subject to the risks of currency fluctuation and political uncertainty. The Fund is non-diversified for purposes of the 1940 Act.. Investing in a non-diversified fund involves greater risk than investing in a diversified fund because a loss resulting from the decline in value of any one security may represent a greater portion of the total assets of a non-diversified fund.PGIM SHORT DURATION MULTI-SECTOR BOND ETF FUND RISKSThe Fund is subject to currency risk, in which the Fund’s net asset value could decline as a result of changes in exchange rates, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments in currencies, or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues related to, currencies, or in derivatives that provide exposure to currencies; debt obligation risk, in which the Fund’s holdings, share price, yield and total return may also fluctuate in response to bond market movements; call and redemption risk, where the issuer may call a bond held by the Fund for redemption before it matures and the Fund may lose income; and liquidity risk, which exists when particular investments are difficult to sell; management risk in which the subadviser will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but the subadviser’s judgments about the attractiveness, value or market trends affecting a particular security, industry or sector or about market movements may be incorrect; reference rate risk, in which the Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that recently transitioned from using or continue to use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value;; and interest rate risk in which the value of your investment may go down when interest rates rise. A rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of longer term or duration debt securities. The Fund may invest in high yield (""junk"") bonds, which are subject to greater credit and market risks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment, extension, and interest rate risks; floating rate loans, which subjects the Fund to the risk that the Fund’s ability to receive payments in connection with loans depends on the financial condition of the borrower (failure to receive such payments may reduce the value of the Fund’s assets); the value of adjustable and floating rate securities may lag behind the value of fixed rate securities when interest rates change; certain loans or obligations in which the fund may invest may be ""covenant-lite"" meaning they contain fewer financial maintenance covenants than other loans or obligations; and derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks. To the extent the Fund invests in U.S. government and agency securities, its potential for capital appreciation may be limited. The Fund is subject to market risks, including economic risks, as well as market disruption and geopolitical risks (the value of investments may decrease, and international conflicts and geopolitical developments may adversely affect the U.S. and foreign financial markets, including increased volatility). These risks may increase the Fund’s share price volatility. The Fund may not be invested in all sectors at a given time.

This compares to earnings of $1.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.70%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil and natural gas producer would post earnings of $0.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of -8.93%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Antero Resources , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, posted revenues of $953.31 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.2 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Antero Resources shares have lost about 21% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19%.What's Next for Antero Resources?While Antero Resources has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Antero Resources: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.07 on $1.08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.53 on $4.63 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States is currently in the bottom 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Devon Energy (DVN), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 1.This oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -53.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Devon Energy's revenues are expected to be $3.81 billion, down 32.4% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

400,30b9dd6e-0737-3793-9316-1beb30b541ca,DVN,2023-07-27,Earnings Preview: PDC Energy (PDCE) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-pdc-energy-pdce-140209042.html,1690380129,STORY,['DVN'],"[The market expects PDC Energy (PDCE) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40.5%.Revenues are expected to be $796.62 million, down 30% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.78% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PDC Energy?For PDC Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PDC Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PDC Energy would post earnings of $2.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.61, delivering a surprise of -10.31%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PDC Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsDevon Energy (DVN), another stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.21 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -53.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.81 billion, down 32.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Devon Energy has been revised 11.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -3.72%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Year-over-year, fleet productivity declined 2.0% while average original equipment at cost (""OEC"") increased 25.5%. On a pro forma basis, including the pre-acquisition results of Ahern Rentals, rental revenue increased 12.4% year-over-year, supported by a 12.5% increase in average OEC and a 2.1% increase in fleet productivity.Used equipment sales in the quarter increased 132.9% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the normalization of volumes and the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition. The used equipment sales generated $382 million of proceeds at a GAAP gross margin of 51.3% and an adjusted gross margin7 of 57.3% compared to $164 million at a GAAP gross margin of 59.1% and an adjusted gross margin of 62.2% for the same period last year. The year-over-year declines in the GAAP and adjusted gross margins primarily reflect the expected normalization of channel mix, including the expanded use of wholesale channels, and the impact of sales of equipment acquired in the Ahern Rentals acquisition.Net income for the quarter increased 19.9% year-over-year to a second quarter record of $591 million, while net income margin decreased 120 basis points to 16.6%. On a pro forma basis, including the pre-acquisition results of Ahern Rentals, second quarter net income margin was flat year-over-year. The decrease in the company's reported net income margin was primarily driven by the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition on rental and used equipment gross margins, increased restructuring charges related to the Ahern Rentals acquisition, and higher interest and income tax expenses, partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expense as a percentage of revenue. Interest expense increased $48 million, or 42.5%, primarily due to increased average debt related to the funding of the Ahern Rentals acquisition, and higher variable debt interest rates. The effective income tax rate increased by 450 basis points to 23.4%, primarily due to one-time discrete benefits in the year-ago period.Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 29.3% year-over-year to a second quarter record of $1.695 billion, while adjusted EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points to 47.7%. On a pro forma basis, including the pre-acquisition results of Ahern Rentals in the year-ago period, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points year-over-year. The increase in the company's reported adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflected reduced SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower gross margins from used equipment sales, as discussed above._______________6.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed below.7.Used equipment sales adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of the fair value mark-up of fleet acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold, as explained further in the tables below.General rentals segment rental revenue increased 22.5% year-over-year, including the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition, to a second quarter record of $2.189 billion. On a pro forma basis, including the pre-acquisition results of Ahern Rentals, second quarter rental revenue for general rentals increased 10.7% year-over-year. Rental gross margin decreased by 270 basis points year-over-year to 36.0%, primarily due to the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition, representing an improvement from the 320 basis point decline to a 32.9% margin in the first quarter of 2023. On a pro forma basis, second quarter rental gross margin declined 70 basis points year-over-year due primarily to the impact of higher depreciation expense related to the Ahern Rentals acquisition.Specialty rentals segment rental revenue increased 17.3% year-over-year to a second quarter record of $792 million. Rental gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 48.6%, primarily due to better cost performance and fixed cost absorption on higher revenue.Cash flow from operating activities increased 9.2% year-over-year to $2.228 billion for the first six months of 2023, and free cash flow, including merger and restructuring related payments, decreased 15.1%, from $964 million to $818 million. The decrease in free cash flow was mainly due to a $299 million increase in net rental capital expenditures, partially offset by higher net cash from operating activities.Capital management. The company's net leverage ratio was 1.8x at June 30, 2023, as compared to 2.0x at December 31, 2022. Year-to-date through June 30, 2023, the company repurchased $500 million8 of common stock under its $1.25 billion8 share repurchase program and paid dividends totaling $205 million. It remains the company's intention to repurchase $1.0 billion8 of common stock during 2023. Additionally, the company's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, payable on August 23, 2023 to stockholders of record on August 9, 2023. During the second quarter, the company also amended its accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing its size by $200 million to $1.3 billion, and amended and extended its uncommitted short-term repurchase facility, pursuant to which it may borrow up to $100 million.Total liquidity was $2.706 billion as of June 30, 2023, including $227 million of cash and cash equivalents.Return on invested capital (ROIC)9 increased 190 basis points year-over-year, and 30 basis points sequentially, to a record 13.4% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023. The year-over-year and sequential improvements primarily reflect increased after-tax operating income.Conference CallUnited Rentals will hold a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, July 27, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call number is 800-451-7724 (international: 785-424-1226). The replay number for the call is 402-220-2565. The passcode for both the conference call and replay is 67803. The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call._______________8.A 1% excise tax is imposed on ""net repurchases"" (certain purchases minus certain issuances) of common stock. The repurchases noted above (as well as the total program size and expected 2023 repurchases) do not include the excise tax, which totaled $3 million year-to-date through June 30, 2023.9.The company’s ROIC metric uses after-tax operating income for the trailing 12 months divided by average stockholders’ equity, debt and deferred taxes, net of average cash. To mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the company’s tax rate from period to period, the U.S. federal corporate statutory tax rate of 21% was used to calculate after-tax operating income.Non-GAAP MeasuresFree cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment and intangible assets. The equipment and intangible asset purchases and proceeds represent cash flows from investing activities. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the restructuring charges, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the restructuring charges, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. See the tables below for further discussion of these non-GAAP measures.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort (as specified in the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K). The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.About United RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the impact of global economic conditions (including inflation, increased interest rates, supply chain constraints, potential trade wars and sanctions and other measures imposed in response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) and public health crises and epidemics on us, our customers and our suppliers, in the United States and the rest of the world; (2) declines in construction or industrial activity, which could adversely impact our revenues and, because many of our costs are fixed, our profitability; (3) rates we charge and time utilization we achieve being less than anticipated; (4) changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix; (5) excess fleet in the equipment rental industry; (6) inability to benefit from government spending, including spending associated with infrastructure projects; (7) trends in oil and natural gas, including significant increases in the prices of oil or natural gas, could adversely affect the demand for our services and products; (8) competition from existing and new competitors; (9) the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate and the industries of our customers, such as those in the construction industry; (10) costs we incur being more than anticipated, including as a result of inflation, and the inability to realize expected savings in the amounts or time frames planned; (11) our significant indebtedness, which requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service and can constrain our flexibility in responding to unanticipated or adverse business conditions; (12) inability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us, including as a result of volatility and uncertainty in capital or credit markets or increases in interest rates, or at all; (13) incurrence of additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness; (14) noncompliance with financial or other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in our lenders terminating the agreements and requiring us to repay outstanding borrowings; (15) restrictive covenants and the amount of borrowings permitted under our debt instruments, which can limit our financial and operational flexibility; (16) inability to access the capital that our businesses or growth plans may require, including as a result of uncertainty in capital or credit markets; (17) the possibility that companies that we have acquired or may acquire could have undiscovered liabilities, or that companies or assets that we have acquired or may acquire could involve other unexpected costs, may strain our management capabilities, or may be difficult to integrate, and that we may not realize the expected benefits from an acquisition over the timeframe we expect, or at all; (18) incurrence of impairment charges; (19) fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases or pay dividends in the time frames and/or on the terms anticipated; (20) our charter provisions as well as provisions of certain debt agreements and our significant indebtedness may have the effect of making more difficult or otherwise discouraging, delaying or deterring a takeover or other change of control of us; (21) inability to manage credit risk adequately or to collect on contracts with a large number of customers; (22) turnover in our management team and inability to attract and retain key personnel, as well as loss, absenteeism or the inability of employees to work or perform key functions in light of public health crises or epidemics; (23) inability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all, as a result of supply chain disruptions, insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors; (24) increases in our maintenance and replacement costs and/or decreases in the residual value of our equipment; (25) inability to sell our new or used fleet in the amounts, or at the prices, we expect; (26) risks related to security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, failure to protect personal information, compliance with data protection laws and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; (27) risks related to climate change and climate change regulation; (28) risks related to our ability to meet our environmental and social goals, including our greenhouse gas intensity reduction goal; (29) the fact that our holding company structure requires us to depend in part on distributions from subsidiaries and such distributions could be limited by contractual or legal restrictions; (30) shortfalls in our insurance coverage; (31) increases in our loss reserves to address business operations or other claims and any claims that exceed our established levels of reserves; (32) incurrence of additional expenses (including indemnification obligations) and other costs in connection with litigation, regulatory and investigatory matters; (33) the costs of complying with environmental, safety and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other risks associated with non-U.S. operations, including currency exchange risk, and tariffs; (34) the outcome or other potential consequences of regulatory matters and commercial litigation; (35) labor shortages and/or disputes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, which may impact our productivity and increase our costs, and changes in law that could affect our labor relations or operations generally; and (36) the effect of changes in tax law.For a more complete description of these and other possible risks and uncertainties, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as to our subsequent filings with the SEC.

Specifically, we seek to optimize the interplay of rental rates, time utilization and mix in driving rental revenue. Fleet productivity aggregates, in one metric, the impact of changes in rates, utilization and mix on owned equipment rental revenue.We believe that this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of our decisions on rates, time utilization and mix, particularly as they support the creation of shareholder value.

See below for further detail on each special item. Management believes that earnings per share - adjusted provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, earnings per share - adjusted is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, earnings per share - adjusted should not be considered an alternative to GAAP earnings per share. The table below provides a reconciliation between earnings per share – GAAP, as-reported, and earnings per share – adjusted.Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30,June 30,2023202220232022Earnings per share - GAAP, as-reported$8.58$6.90$15.04$11.93After-tax (1) impact of:Merger related intangible asset amortization (2)0.550.451.260.96Impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment (3)0.300.260.620.36Impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet (4)0.250.050.690.12Restructuring charge (5)0.20—0.210.01Asset impairment charge (6)—0.02—0.02Loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities (7)—0.18—0.18Earnings per share - adjusted$9.88$7.86$17.82$13.58Tax rate applied to above adjustments (1)25.3%25.3%25.3%25.3%(1)The tax rates applied to the adjustments reflect the statutory rates in the applicable entities.(2)Reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the major acquisitions completed since 2012 that significantly impact our operations (the ""major acquisitions,"" each of which had annual revenues of over $200 million prior to acquisition).

The increase in 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the Ahern Rentals acquisition.(5)Primarily reflects severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. We only include such costs that are part of a restructuring program as restructuring charges. The designated restructuring programs generally involve the closure of a large number of branches over a short period of time, often in periods following a major acquisition, and result in significant costs that we would not normally incur absent a major acquisition or other triggering event that results in the initiation of a restructuring program. Since the first such restructuring program was initiated in 2008, we have completed six restructuring programs. In the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a restructuring program following the closing of the Ahern Rentals acquisition, which is our only open restructuring program as of June 30, 2023. The increase in 2023 reflects charges associated with the restructuring program initiated following the closing of the Ahern Rentals acquisition.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the restructuring charges, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. See below for further detail on each adjusting item. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30,June 30,2023202220232022Net income$591$493$1,042$860Provision for income taxes181115324231Interest expense, net161113311207Depreciation of rental equipment5924571,167892Non-rental depreciation and amortization10491222188EBITDA$1,629$1,269$3,066$2,378Restructuring charge (1)181191Stock compensation expense, net (2)25364960Impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet (3)2356411Adjusted EBITDA$1,695$1,311$3,198$2,450Net income margin16.6%17.8%15.2%16.2%Adjusted EBITDA margin47.7%47.3%46.8%46.3%(1)Primarily reflects severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs.

Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.

To skip our detailed analysis of investing moves today, you can go directly to see the 5 Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love.Investing in stocks will always be a tricky exercise. The market is plagued with high volatility, especially in times of economic crisis with the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and high inflation. Many industries and companies have been feeling the heat turned on by the Fed as a result. In these market conditions, many investors are opting to play it safe rather than be left sorry, as they continue to be wary of stocks and sectors that have either been performing poorly over the past couple of years or those that have the potential to be beaten back in the face of a rapidly transforming market with everchanging trends. At the same time, billionaires and investors in the US are making their own moves as they track the market to pick the best time to cash in their shares and turn a profit.Latest Insider TradesOn July 11, CNBC's Robert Frank reported the latest moves made by top billionaires and CEOs in this market. He noted that during the first half of 2023, about $9 billion worth of shares had been sold by these individuals. They included the Waltons, the family behind Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), who had sold shares of the company worth $4.39 billion year-to-date as of July 11. Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), also cashed in his company's shares worth $893 million year-to-date. Oracle Corporation's (NASDAQ:ORCL) CTO, Larry Ellison, also added another $848 million to his wealth by cashing in the company's shares. Safra Catz, the CEO of Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), also cashed in $470 million by selling her company's shares at a prime moment. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) also saw its CEO selling its shares worth $302 million during the first half of the year. Finally, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) also joined the selling frenzy, making about $210 million with his sale of the company's stock.Story continuesAccording to Frank, this flurry of insider selling has been primarily motivated by questions of valuation. He noted that many of the stocks in question above saw 52-week highs at the start of the year, making this an opportune moment to get out of the trade and make a profit. Yet while the market is seeing many stocks such as these performing at record high levels, there are also many companies whose stocks have been taking a hit during this year. One example is Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), a stock that is down by 8.65% over the past year as of July 14. This stock has been continuing a downward spiral for the past five years, over which period it has fallen by 49.40%. Other well-known stocks that have fallen out of favor over the past few years include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the former being down by 3.54% over the past year and 20.53% over the past five years, while the latter is down by 17.61% over the past five years.What Are Hedge Funds Up To?Many factors are responsible for the worrying performance of these reputable companies, and some would assume that this performance would result in investors and hedge funds alike fleeing their positions in them. However, we have seen over the first quarter that numerous hedge funds have continued to stick by these stocks despite their poor performance, leading one to think twice before they abandon their stakes in these companies. This seems to imply that hedge funds today may be betting on companies such as the one mentioned above in the long run in hopes of making back their money and perhaps even turning a profit at the end of their trade. Considering this, we have compiled a list of 12 stocks that have similarly been performing poorly enough to lose the support of the broader market but have managed to retain the confidence of the hedge funds investing in them. Some may argue that several of these stocks are even some of the best undervalued stocks to buy today or some of the top cheap undervalued stocks on the market.12 Out of Favor Stocks that Hedge Funds LoveOur MethodologyWe first listed down all large-cap stocks that have fallen significantly in value over the past 24 months. From these stocks, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors according to Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love12. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Two-year performance: -76.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a communication services company also operating digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses. It is based in Singapore.There were 65 hedge funds long Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.Sachin Salgaonkar at BofA maintains a Neutral rating and a $90 price target on Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) shares as of May 17.Cheyne Capital was the most prominent shareholder in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) at the end of the first quarter, holding 48,800 shares in the company.Here's what Artisan Partners said about Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Bottom contributors to performance for the quarter included Southeast Asian Internet leader Sea Limited (NYSE:SE). Sea declined due to rising investor concerns around e-commerce competition from TikTok in Southeast Asia during a period of subdued gross merchandise value growth, while the gaming business continues to struggle.”11. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Two-year performance: -52.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Chiodo holds a Neutral rating on Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) shares as of July 14, alongside a $55 price target.Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) was spotted in the portfolios of 66 hedge funds during the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.5 billion.Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is an information technology company providing and e-commerce platform and services. It is based in Ottawa, Canada.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP): Shopify shares were a top contributor in the quarter as the market focused on the company’s recent price increases and its ongoing market share gains in e-commerce gross merchandise volumes (GMV). Earlier in the quarter the company reported better-than-expected 4Q results, with 26% revenue growth and $248 million of FCF (at a 14% margin), significantly better than the Street consensus of -$109 million.Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels. We believe that the overall growth of e-commerce, combined with the development of new products and services, such as its digital wallet Shop Pay and its pick, pack and ship Shopify Fulfillment Network, should continue to drive revenue growth of about 20% per year over the next several years, accompanied by re-acceleration of operating margin growth and FCF generation.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a stock that has managed to retain its popularity with hedge funds despite its recent performance.10. Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS)Two-year performance: -60.06%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66A total of 66 hedge funds were long Pinterest, Inc.

(NYSE:PINS) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Slightly countering that decline was the 4% gain for Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), an image-based social media company. The company posted better-than-expected third quarter results and forward guidance was in line with Street estimates. Pinterest expects significant margin improvement after a relatively heavy investment cycle.”9. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Two-year performance: -15.26%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a biotechnology company working on neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and their treatments.

(NYSE:FIS) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio holdings most directly impacted by the bank failures of the first quarter were Charles Schwab and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), both top detractors for the quarter. Banking software provider FIS’s shares were also collateral damage as investors looked to shed any exposure to the small and regional banks that FIS serves. This, after several quarters of underwhelming operating results, lands FIS as our top detractor for the fiscal year period as well. Our FIS experience has been disappointing to be sure. But having re-underwritten our investment thesis and lowered our business value estimate, we believe investors have exacted too steep a penalty on FIS shares. From this lowered price, we are optimistic that new management can reestablish credibility with investors and unlock value through the planned separation of the banking software and merchant services businesses.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a stock that many elite hedge funds are piling into this year.7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Two-year performance: -3.41%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Sciencast Management held the most shares in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) at the end of the first quarter, holding 11,900 shares in the company.Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified banking company.

(Nasdaq: MU) today announced it has begun sampling the industry’s first 8-high 24GB HBM3 Gen2 memory with bandwidth greater than 1.2TB/s and pin speed over 9.2Gb/s, which is up to a 50% improvement over currently shipping HBM3 solutions. With a 2.5 times performance per watt improvement over previous generations, Micron’s HBM3 Gen2 offering sets new records for the critical artificial intelligence (AI) data center metrics of performance, capacity and power efficiency. These Micron improvements reduce training times of large language models like GPT-4 and beyond, deliver efficient infrastructure use for AI inference and provide superior total cost of ownership (TCO).The foundation of Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) solution is Micron’s industry-leading 1β (1-beta) DRAM process node, which allows a 24Gb DRAM die to be assembled into an 8-high cube within an industry-standard package dimension. Moreover, Micron’s 12-high stack with 36GB capacity will begin sampling in the first quarter of calendar 2024. Micron provides 50% more capacity for a given stack height compared to existing competitive solutions. Micron’s HBM3 Gen2 performance-to-power ratio and pin speed improvements are critical for managing the extreme power demands of today’s AI data centers. The improved power efficiency is possible because of Micron advancements such as doubling of the through-silicon vias (TSVs) over competitive HBM3 offerings, thermal impedance reduction through a five-time increase in metal density, and an energy-efficient data path design.Micron, a proven leader in memory for 2.5D/3D-stacking and advanced packaging technologies, is proud to be a partner in TSMC’s 3DFabric Alliance and to help shape the future of semiconductor and system innovations. As part of the HBM3 Gen2 product development effort, the collaboration between Micron and TSMC lays the foundation for a smooth introduction and integration in compute systems for AI and HPC design applications. TSMC has received samples of Micron’s HBM3 Gen2 memory and is working closely with Micron for further evaluation and tests that will benefit customers’ innovation for the next-generation HPC application.Story continuesThe Micron HBM3 Gen2 solution addresses increasing demands in the world of generative AI for multimodal, multitrillion-parameter AI models. With 24GB of capacity per cube and more than 9.2Gb/s of pin speed, the training time for large language models is reduced by more than 30% and results in lower TCO. Additionally, the Micron offering unlocks a significant increase in queries per day, enabling trained models to be used more efficiently. Micron HBM3 Gen2 memory’s best-in-class performance per watt drives tangible cost savings for modern AI data centers. For an installation of 10 million GPUs, every five watts of power savings per HBM cube is estimated to save operational expenses of up to $550 million over five years.“Micron’s HBM3 Gen2 technology was developed with a focus on unleashing superior AI and high-performance computing solutions for our customers and the industry,” said Praveen Vaidyanathan, vice president and general manager of Micron’s Compute Products Group. “One important criterion for us has been the ease of integrating our HBM3 Gen2 product into our customers’ platforms. A fully programmable Memory Built-In Self Test (MBIST) that can run at the full specification pin speed positions us for improved testing capability with our customers, creates more efficient collaboration and delivers a faster time to market.”“At the core of generative AI is accelerated computing, which benefits from HBM high bandwidth with energy efficiency,” said Ian Buck, vice president of Hyperscale and HPC Computing at NVIDIA. “We have a long history of collaborating with Micron across a wide range of products and are eager to be working with them on HBM3 Gen2 to supercharge AI innovation.”Micron developed this breakthrough product by leveraging its global engineering organization, with design and process development in the United States, memory fabrication in Japan and advanced packaging in Taiwan. Today’s announcement is another milestone in Micron’s technology leadership in the industry. Micron previously announced its 1α (1-alpha) 24Gb monolithic DRAM die-based 96GB DDR5 modules for capacity-hungry server solutions and today introduced the1β 24Gb die-based 24GB HBM3 offering. In the first half of calendar 2024, the company plans to make available its 1β 32Gb monolithic DRAM die-based 128GB DDR5 modules. These offerings demonstrate Micron’s leading-edge technology innovations for AI servers.Visit micron.com/HBM3 for more information.Resources Section:HBM3 web pageSix Five Insider Podcast Interview with Girish CherusseryAbout Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions, transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

To skip our detailed analysis of investing moves today, you can go directly to see the 5 Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love.Investing in stocks will always be a tricky exercise. The market is plagued with high volatility, especially in times of economic crisis with the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and high inflation. Many industries and companies have been feeling the heat turned on by the Fed as a result. In these market conditions, many investors are opting to play it safe rather than be left sorry, as they continue to be wary of stocks and sectors that have either been performing poorly over the past couple of years or those that have the potential to be beaten back in the face of a rapidly transforming market with everchanging trends. At the same time, billionaires and investors in the US are making their own moves as they track the market to pick the best time to cash in their shares and turn a profit.Latest Insider TradesOn July 11, CNBC's Robert Frank reported the latest moves made by top billionaires and CEOs in this market. He noted that during the first half of 2023, about $9 billion worth of shares had been sold by these individuals. They included the Waltons, the family behind Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), who had sold shares of the company worth $4.39 billion year-to-date as of July 11. Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), also cashed in his company's shares worth $893 million year-to-date. Oracle Corporation's (NASDAQ:ORCL) CTO, Larry Ellison, also added another $848 million to his wealth by cashing in the company's shares. Safra Catz, the CEO of Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), also cashed in $470 million by selling her company's shares at a prime moment. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) also saw its CEO selling its shares worth $302 million during the first half of the year. Finally, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) also joined the selling frenzy, making about $210 million with his sale of the company's stock.Story continuesAccording to Frank, this flurry of insider selling has been primarily motivated by questions of valuation. He noted that many of the stocks in question above saw 52-week highs at the start of the year, making this an opportune moment to get out of the trade and make a profit. Yet while the market is seeing many stocks such as these performing at record high levels, there are also many companies whose stocks have been taking a hit during this year. One example is Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), a stock that is down by 8.65% over the past year as of July 14. This stock has been continuing a downward spiral for the past five years, over which period it has fallen by 49.40%. Other well-known stocks that have fallen out of favor over the past few years include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the former being down by 3.54% over the past year and 20.53% over the past five years, while the latter is down by 17.61% over the past five years.What Are Hedge Funds Up To?Many factors are responsible for the worrying performance of these reputable companies, and some would assume that this performance would result in investors and hedge funds alike fleeing their positions in them. However, we have seen over the first quarter that numerous hedge funds have continued to stick by these stocks despite their poor performance, leading one to think twice before they abandon their stakes in these companies. This seems to imply that hedge funds today may be betting on companies such as the one mentioned above in the long run in hopes of making back their money and perhaps even turning a profit at the end of their trade. Considering this, we have compiled a list of 12 stocks that have similarly been performing poorly enough to lose the support of the broader market but have managed to retain the confidence of the hedge funds investing in them. Some may argue that several of these stocks are even some of the best undervalued stocks to buy today or some of the top cheap undervalued stocks on the market.12 Out of Favor Stocks that Hedge Funds LoveOur MethodologyWe first listed down all large-cap stocks that have fallen significantly in value over the past 24 months. From these stocks, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors according to Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love12. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Two-year performance: -76.6%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a communication services company also operating digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses. It is based in Singapore.There were 65 hedge funds long Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.Sachin Salgaonkar at BofA maintains a Neutral rating and a $90 price target on Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) shares as of May 17.Cheyne Capital was the most prominent shareholder in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) at the end of the first quarter, holding 48,800 shares in the company.Here's what Artisan Partners said about Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Bottom contributors to performance for the quarter included Southeast Asian Internet leader Sea Limited (NYSE:SE). Sea declined due to rising investor concerns around e-commerce competition from TikTok in Southeast Asia during a period of subdued gross merchandise value growth, while the gaming business continues to struggle.”11. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Two-year performance: -52.5%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Chiodo holds a Neutral rating on Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) shares as of July 14, alongside a $55 price target.Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) was spotted in the portfolios of 66 hedge funds during the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.5 billion.Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is an information technology company providing and e-commerce platform and services. It is based in Ottawa, Canada.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP): Shopify shares were a top contributor in the quarter as the market focused on the company’s recent price increases and its ongoing market share gains in e-commerce gross merchandise volumes (GMV). Earlier in the quarter the company reported better-than-expected 4Q results, with 26% revenue growth and $248 million of FCF (at a 14% margin), significantly better than the Street consensus of -$109 million.Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels. We believe that the overall growth of e-commerce, combined with the development of new products and services, such as its digital wallet Shop Pay and its pick, pack and ship Shopify Fulfillment Network, should continue to drive revenue growth of about 20% per year over the next several years, accompanied by re-acceleration of operating margin growth and FCF generation.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a stock that has managed to retain its popularity with hedge funds despite its recent performance.10. Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS)Two-year performance: -60.06%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66A total of 66 hedge funds were long Pinterest, Inc.

The company posted better-than-expected third quarter results and forward guidance was in line with Street estimates. Pinterest expects significant margin improvement after a relatively heavy investment cycle.”9. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Two-year performance: -15.26%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a biotechnology company working on neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and their treatments.

(NYSE:FIS) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The portfolio holdings most directly impacted by the bank failures of the first quarter were Charles Schwab and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), both top detractors for the quarter. Banking software provider FIS’s shares were also collateral damage as investors looked to shed any exposure to the small and regional banks that FIS serves. This, after several quarters of underwhelming operating results, lands FIS as our top detractor for the fiscal year period as well. Our FIS experience has been disappointing to be sure. But having re-underwritten our investment thesis and lowered our business value estimate, we believe investors have exacted too steep a penalty on FIS shares. From this lowered price, we are optimistic that new management can reestablish credibility with investors and unlock value through the planned separation of the banking software and merchant services businesses.”Like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a stock that many elite hedge funds are piling into this year.7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Two-year performance: -3.41%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Sciencast Management held the most shares in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) at the end of the first quarter, holding 11,900 shares in the company.Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified banking company.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis banking and payment technologies company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.7 billion, down 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fidelity National?For Fidelity National, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Fidelity National will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fidelity National would post earnings of $1.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.29, delivering a surprise of +7.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fidelity National appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsGlobal Payments (GPN), another stock in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.58 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +9.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.18 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Global Payments has been revised 0.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.90%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Global Payments will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities. Restaurants in Russia were treated as permanently closed as of April 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable guest counts beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyperinflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, McDonald's excluded results from Argentina and Lebanon in the calculation of comparable sales due to hyperinflation (Venezuela continues to be excluded). Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.RELATED COMMUNICATIONSThis press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information related to the Company's results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023.McDonald's Corporation will broadcast its investor earnings conference call live over the Internet at 7:30 a.m. (Central Time) on July 27, 2023.

I'll now hand the call over to Dave for opening remarks.Story continuesWilliam David MosleyThank you, Shanye, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you being here with us on today's call. Amid a tough business environment, Seagate delivered fourth quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, while holding non-GAAP operating margin at 3.5% to narrow our non-GAAP loss per share to $0.18. These results demonstrate financial leverage and our focus on returning to profitability. Importantly, we continue to generate positive free cash flow, achieving $168 million for the quarter and $626 million for the fiscal year, reinforcing Seagate's solid operational and financial execution amid the business backdrop we have seen in fiscal 2023. This past fiscal year has been shaped by macro and end market conditions that have tested our resilience in addition to our financial performance. I'm proud of our team's perseverance and execution. As a result of our proactive actions, we've lowered our cost structure by more than $350 million on an annualized basis. We've enhanced balance sheet flexibility taking out nearly $800 million of debt funded largely by monetizing nonmanufacturing facility assets. We reduced production output by approximately 25% compared with peak volume in order to drive better supply/demand dynamics and enhance profitability as the markets recover. And all of these accomplishments were made while delivering on our 30-plus terabyte HAMR product development and qualification milestones with volume ramp on track to begin in early calendar 2024. Looking ahead, we expect the macro end-to-end market conditions that we have flagged throughout fiscal 2023 to continue weighing on demand through at least December. Consistent with our track record of managing what is within our control, we are taking additional measures to weather the near-term business environment. First, we are adjusting pricing, which we believe will help to ensure a healthy industry supply chain for our customers over the long term. And second, we are carefully managing our manufacturing capacity through a build-to-order approach for certain areas of the business to align our future production output with customer qualifications and demand plans. It will take time to bring production capacity and associated support resources back online. Therefore, it is crucial that we balance lead times for mass capacity products with our ability to reramp production. We expect these efforts will enable Seagate to efficiently manage supply for our customers as demand improves. I'll now share some perspectives on near-term demand factors, in particular in the mass capacity markets, starting with our business in China. As expected, sales in China improved sequentially off of the March quarter lows, driven by increased demand in the VIA markets and certain regional cloud and enterprise OEM customers. While these trends are pointing in the right direction, sales are still well below historical levels. Since the strict COVID protocols were eased last December, the pace of economic recovery in China has been uneven. For now, we are forecasting sales into China to remain relatively stable for the balance of the calendar year. We are encouraged to see Chinese authorities begin to inject more stimulus to reaccelerate economic growth. Based on customer input, economic improvement is expected to catalyze e-commerce, drive cloud-related ad revenue and spur new smart city projects. Seagate's VIA and nearline products are positioned to benefit from these anticipated improvements in the end market demand. Outside of China, nearline demand from enterprise OEM customers has remained soft. CIOs continue to operate under tighter budgets in response to near-term macroeconomic uncertainties, ongoing efforts to optimize existing workloads, both on-prem and in the cloud, are helping enterprise customers defer mass storage deployments. These trends have slowed the pace of inventory absorption among most of our U.S. cloud customers. We have significantly reduced shipments to several large cloud customers in order to accelerate inventory absorption and protect our financial returns. We project it will take another couple of quarters for inventory levels to normalize. We also believe the timing for demand recovery could be affected by spending priorities focused on accelerating the build-out of compute-intensive AI infrastructure. While AI and ML have been around for quite some time, generative AI has quickly emerged as the next megatrend. This megatrend makes us as excited as ever about the long-term growth drivers for Seagate. In addition to the ongoing migration of workloads to the cloud, which we believe is far from over, gen AI is expected to be a catalyst for data creation, underpinning future demand for mass capacity storage. In today's earliest stages of gen AI development, you're seeing the necessary first steps of building and training of AI models. These efforts require significant investment in compute architectures, and we're seeing that investment ramp today. The next stage of development will yield enterprise-specific use cases that leverage trained AI models to convert data into value-enhancing applications. As this phase plays out, cost-effective mass storage will be critical and we see HDD as a long-term beneficiary. We are already seeing examples of content creators generating high-definition images from text, which is growing in use as evidenced by 4 of the top services [totaling] 20 million images each day. Development is well underway to create data-intensive videos and animations simply from voice commands. The adoption of AI-generated video bodes well for mass capacity storage. For context, today, nearly 4 million videos are uploaded daily to YouTube and their file sizes can be thousands of times larger than a single image. Additionally, we believe that predictive AI will lead to advances in many fields, including science and health care. For example, predictive AI can be used to analyze large collection of medical images, many created by Gen AI to provide insight for early detection, prevent disease progressions and develop patient-specific treatments. Mass capacity data storage will remain both an enabler and beneficiary of these trends working in harmony with flash and DRAM memories to bring AI applications to bear. While flash will continue to feed high-performance compute engines, mass capacity HDDs will remain the most cost-efficient storage media to house the enormous volumes of data being generated and used for predictive analytics. Even in today's unsustainably low NAND pricing environment, HDDs are still roughly 5x more cost-efficient and comparable flash solutions on a per bit basis, and we do not project that gap to close in the next decade. This level of conviction is due in large part to our leading technology road map. Seagate is leveraging magnetic recording technology innovations such as HAMR across our mature [10-disc] HDD platform, positioning us very well to meet increasing demand, including from data-intensive AI applications. Given the current business climate, Seagate is focused on product development, execution and helping our customers qualify next-generation drive capacities. We are executing well on both fronts. We continue to deliver areal density and TCO advancements through our conventional PMR hard disk drive products. Development efforts on what may be our last PMR product are nearing completion and will extend drive capacities into the mid- to upper 20 terabyte range. As mentioned earlier, our 30-plus terabyte product launch plan is fully intact and initial customer qualifications are progressing well. We are on track to begin volume ramp in early calendar 2024. We are also preparing qualifications with a broader number of customers, including testing for lower capacity drives targeting VIA and enterprise OEM workloads. While there's always work to do, I am pleased with the progress the product development teams have made during fiscal year 2023. Overall, Seagate has consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly adjust and execute at a high level on every factor within our control. We remain diligent in managing through near-term business conditions. At the same time, I'm excited by the tremendous long-term opportunities ahead brought about by existing and emerging megatrends underpinned by data. Cost-effective mass capacity storage is a critical enabler and Seagate is poised to deliver with strong technology road maps and improving financial leverage. I'll stop there and hand it over to Gianluca.Gianluca RomanoThank you, Dave. Amidst the current industry down cycle, we delivered results that demonstrate our ability to maintain disciplined production output and strong cost control measures. For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $1.6 billion, in line with our recent public commentary and non-GAAP loss of $0.18 per share, slightly better than the midpoint of our guided range. Total hard disk drive revenue declined 14% sequentially to $1.4 billion, with shipment of 91 exabytes. Mass capacity revenue declined 20% sequentially to $1 billion, reflecting softer demand in the cloud nearline market, partially offset by an improvement in the VIA business. Shipment into the mass capacity markets totaled 75 exabytes compared with 104 exabytes in the March quarter. Mass capacity shipments as a percentage of total HDD exabyte was roughly 82% compared to the March quarter 88%. The expected slowdown in our cloud business led to nearline shipments of 55 exabytes, down 37% sequentially. As Dave outlined earlier, we anticipate that it will take a couple more quarters for CSPs to consume inventory and demand to improve. Specific to the VIA market, revenue was up sequentially from what we believe was a demand drop in the March quarter. We expect a relatively stable VIA demand environment in the second half of the calendar year, although still below the run rate before the downturn. Within the legacy market, revenue was $401 million, up 8% sequentially, reflecting higher demand for mission-critical products. The client and consumer markets were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, typical for a June quarter. Finally, revenue for non-HDD business decreased 15% sequentially to $218 million. As anticipated, current IT spending behavior in light of economic uncertainties impacted our enterprise system business. We expect this headwind and the purchase timing for a couple of large customers to result in a meaningful decline in our system revenue in the September quarter. Importantly, we shipped our first HAMR-based Corvault system for revenue as planned during the June quarter. We expect broader availability of these Corvault systems by the end of calendar 2023. Moving to our operational performance. Non-GAAP gross profit in the June quarter was $313 million, down 10% sequentially, reflecting lower revenue and a less favorable mix partially offset by lower underutilization costs. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 80 basis points sequentially, approaching 20%. Underutilization cost decreased to approximately $40 million in the June quarter as we temporarily increased production to build long lead time components. Based on the current business outlook that Dave outlined, we expect higher [underutilization] costs in the September quarter. However, we expect gross margin to modestly increase as our cost structure improvements are fully realized and we implement pricing adjustments in certain markets during the second half of calendar 2023. We reduced non-GAAP operating expenses to $258 million, down $91 million year-over-year and $24 million sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects our cost structure improvement actions to date, lower variable compensation as well as disciplined cost management. We expect non-GAAP OpEx in the September quarter to be similar to the June quarter, reflecting nearly full realization of cost savings from restructuring efforts announced in April, offsetting an increase related to the recent sales and leaseback of 3 nonmanufacturing sites. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the June quarter with liquidity level of approximately $2.3 billion, including our revolving credit facilities of $1.5 billion, which was lowered by $250 million as previously disclosed in the credit agreement amendment. Inventory was down $60 million quarter-over-quarter at $1.14 billion and we will continue to focus on reducing our own inventory in the coming quarters. Capital expenditure totaled $50 million in the June quarter, down 7% sequentially. Fiscal year '23 CapEx was $316 million or roughly 4% of revenue. We target lower CapEx in fiscal year '24 as we maintain our focus on shifting to a build-to-order factory loading, balancing supply to demand and still supporting our innovation-driven product road map. Free cash flow generation was $168 million for the quarter, and $626 million for the fiscal year, reflecting solid operational execution and efficiency in working capital management. We expect free cash flow to be lower in the September quarter as we incur a majority of the cash payments associated with the restructuring charges announced in April. We used $145 million for the quarterly dividend and exited the quarter with 207 million shares outstanding. There were no share repurchases during the quarter. Our debt balance equity in the quarter was $5.5 billion, down $507 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting the 2023 notes retirement. This debt reduction was mostly funded to the sales and leaseback of the 3 facilities noted earlier. Additionally, we raised $1 billion in new notes and used the proceeds to prepay $450 million of existing term loans and retired the March 2024 notes of $500 million. As a result of these actions, we now have less than 12% of total debt coming due over the next 2 fiscal years. Interest expense in the June quarter was $84 million and is expected to increase slightly for the September quarter, reflecting a full quarter of the debt restructuring actions that I just described. Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months totaled $974 million, resulting in a net debt leverage ratio of 4.8x, well below our amended credit agreement terms. Turning to our September quarter outlook. For the hard drive business, we expect incremental improvements in mass capacity to offset declines in the legacy market. For non-HDD, revenue for the system business is expected to decrease sequentially due in part to demand timing among a couple of our large system customers, as noted earlier. With that as context, we expect September quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.55 billion, plus or minus $150 million. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, which includes the proactive measure we discussed today, partially offset by higher underutilization cost in the range of $70 million. And we expect a non-GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.16 plus or minus $0.20. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.William David MosleyThanks, Gianluca. I'm proud of the perseverance and agility as we continue to proactively respond to the market environment we have faced over this past year. Entering fiscal 2024, we are leaner. Our balance sheet is healthier and our product road map is stronger. All of these factors enhance our ability to weather near-term market conditions, deliver financial leverage and position the company to capture attractive long-term opportunities for mass capacity storage. As we conclude our prepared remarks, I would like to thank our employees, suppliers, customers and shareholders once again for their support. Thanks for joining us, and let's open up the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from [Chris Shankar] with TD Cowen.Hadi M. OrabiThis is Eddy for Chris from TD Cowen. I understand you won't guide for December, but curious to know your thoughts on December nearline exabyte shipments. Like do you see them growing sequentially from September, more like flat or maybe slightly down. I'm asking because in case we remain at current revenue of $1.6 billion per quarter into next year. I'm wondering if there would be a risk to the dividend in case, especially you guys continue to invest in the business.William David MosleyYes. Thanks, Eddy. So we aren't guiding for December. I think we expect at this point to hold the line on overbuilding. And so that's one of the reasons we're being very cautious. But there will be some -- there's an indication of some natural flow-through at the cloud service providers, for example. So we expect it to slowly start trending back up from here. I don't expect a big hockey stick rebound. I mean I could be wrong on that, but -- and we do expect it to slowly go back up mainly because we're not pushing in a bunch of our own inventory. And relative to the dividend, we're planning for all this in all of our plans right now. And I think the way we execute this plan, we should be just fine and we want to continue to be the person for all of our stakeholders that we've always been before, we've got laser focus on that right now.OperatorThe next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.Wamsi MohanI was wondering, Dave, if you could flush out a little bit to the points that you made in your prepared remarks, one on adjusting pricing strategy in certain markets. What specifically are you doing in these markets? And then secondarily, the reduced production output through this build-to-order and lower CapEx comments that you made. How exactly will this build-to-order work? Is this specifically for mass capacity, what kind of lead times would you require? And are your customers? And what do you expect follow-through from customers and also from a competitive standpoint?William David MosleyThanks, Wamsi. Yes, it is complicated because there's a number of different markets in play here. So for example, a distribution channel or some of the classic markets we have consumer client server, you just don't move things very quickly. But some places, it's relatively easier to raise prices and have that flow through into the system. On mass capacity drives, generally speaking, we do the price increases through transitions of products. So we'll say this is the changing economics, we need to make sure that we get paid for that. So as we go through the next product generation, there's still a TCO benefit to the end customer to drive through that product transition, but the economics have to change, largely so that we can go back and pay our suppliers and keep everybody healthy. There's been such a profound downturn in demand that we have to make sure that the entire supply chain is treated properly. But exactly what you said, different markets are behaving very differently and accept things very differently. And this is the direction we're pushing at this point.Gianluca RomanoYes. On the cost side, Wamsi and on the production that is, of course, driving under utilization. We had a little bit higher production in the June quarter, mainly on the wafer side and a little bit on the media, but I would say more on the wafer. We will not need to do that level of production right now. So the under utilization charges were declined in the June quarter from almost $80 million to $40 million. It's probably going up a little bit in September. We estimated about $70 million. But of course, through the quarter, that could change a little bit.OperatorThe next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.Timothy Michael ArcuriI also had a question on pricing and sort of how you think about it versus market share. We've heard examples of you raising prices 10% to 15%. It's obviously a little bit counterintuitive in such a soft market. So I guess 2 questions. One, how are customers reacting to that? And then also, are you willing to lose share as you kind of look out, is there like a line in the sand on share that you're going to draw where you wouldn't raise pricing if you lost share? Or are you willing to lose share to get pricing reset to a more acceptable level?William David MosleyYes. Thanks, Tim. So yes, you are right. It's a weak demand environment, but I think also there's generally speaking, the whole industry is underwater. So I mean, we have to make sure we protect ourselves, we protect the supply base as we talked about earlier. And it's different in different products across the market, obviously, the different markets, obviously. How is it being accepted. There's -- you can imagine the entire [ponopoly] of different responses. Some people are worried about supply longer term. They do believe that supply will be short and demand will come back. And so -- and especially with the long, long lead times that there are on mass capacity products right now. I think it's something that people are very much in tune with. And so it's forcing good discussions. There's other people for various reasons that need to make tactical procurement decisions and they'll take whatever deals that are out in front of them. And I get that. I mean, that happens from time to time in the business. That's one of the big reasons why we don't want to overbuild. We want to make sure we hold as much as we possibly can. And as we continue to play this forward, I think we'll see and adjust accordingly to make sure that we defend our products. I think the optimism for us is that we can actually go through the product transitions, get to the higher capacity points to provide a better TCO proposition, get components out of the supply chains and so on. And then we didn't dilute or extend the problem any by overbuilding or dilute the problem by continuing to overbuild and then lowering price. And that's what we have to hold on to.OperatorThe next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.Erik William Richard WoodringAwesome. Dave, I just wanted to ask if you could flesh out the comment you made in your prepared remarks about the timing of the demand recovery being delayed by AI investments. Just in the context of you talking about market conditions, weighing on demand through December, are you telling us we shouldn't expect sequential growth in capacity shipped until calendar '24? Just if you could help us connect some of these thoughts, that would be great.William David MosleyThanks, Erik. Yes. And I think I mentioned in one of the earlier comments that there will be slight capacity growth. But the way I read through most of the results that are already coming through in the cloud and in most of my conversations as well, I think it's fairly consistent that there's priorities being put on data center infrastructure, new data center build-out, power infrastructure that was already kind of -- things were biased that way instead of mass capacity storage, the mass capacity being something that would come later. And we all know about the great new capabilities that there are in some of the compute technologies and how those new technologies are being applied in new applications. So that's AI. And that's a high priority for cloud service providers and people doing stuff on-prem as well. We think data follows behind that. Predicting it is going to be really tough, but we do think that, that's going to be a [bow wave] at some point, there will be competition for the data that actually feeds the AI engines, if you will. Right now, there's a big battle to get the AI engines up and running and show those applications as being meaningful, and I think that's an interesting space to watch. Behind it, there's going to be a lot of data that actually has to feed those AI engines every day, every day, every day, and we think that's mass capacity infrastructure net positive.OperatorThe next question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays.Thomas James O'MalleyIn the deck, you guys mentioned that you were extending your PMR platform into the mid- to upper 20 TB capacities. Could you talk about where your original plan was to extend into the mid-20s and where that is now and why you made that decision?William David MosleyYes, Tom, there's no real change. We've been talking about it, I think, for about a year. We said we can get PMR into the mid-20s. And the product that we have now -- let me -- I'll talk about it very quickly here. We believe that with SMR variants that can get in the high 20s, the product is in the mid-20s, but it's highly, highly leveraged. It's almost identical electronics and mechanics that takes us to HAMR. So it's almost the same product you swap out the heads and disks for HAMR and a couple of other component changes that have to happen. So we're going to get a lot of leverage from that. That platform has been planned for a long, long time. We called it a 10-disk platform in the prepared remarks. So I have a lot of confidence that we can solution PMR anywhere that the customer wants to stay there in the mid-20s or we can go to HAMR variants with the same bag of parts or very, very similar bag of parts. I do think that there's a lot of confusion out in the market, I'll say it this way about what capacity point, is it 24, 25, 26. Look, there's customers who need all kinds of different variants. And I think we confuse people, frankly, by kind of amalgamating all these things. All I will say is that I think those products that we have are very, very competitive in the market. Right now, the issue is if I added -- I'm not going to try to force it into the market into a space that people don't need the product simply because that poisons the well for that product maybe 2 quarters out or 3 quarters after when people do need it, and it would erode the value proposition for the HAMR products when they come. So we've got to run the business the way we are right now.Gianluca RomanoYes. Let me add to that just for clarity, when we say the mid-20s is in the CMR version, if you go to the SMR version of that drive, of course, we are in the mid- to high 20s.OperatorThe next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.William David MosleyAaron, sorry, we can't hear you.Aaron Christopher RakersYes, sorry about that. I just wanted to unpack some of the kind of considerations we should be thinking about in terms of gross margin as we move forward. Appreciating that you're not guiding explicitly. But I guess, first of all, if I look at the pricing discussion, based on the math, it looks like your mass capacity dollar per terabyte was up by about 10% sequentially. I guess as we look forward, should we be thinking that the ASP on that basis continues to trend higher? Or how much of that capacity shift, have you already kind of imposed price increases upon? And then also, when we look at the capacity shift in total with a 25% reduction in production capacity, do we take prior peak capacity shipment levels and take 25% of that, and that should be a level for which you think you would get back to kind of that 30% gross margin level? I know there's a lot in that, but I'm just trying to think about some of the variables, looking out just not this current quarter, but beyond.William David MosleyThanks, Aaron. I'll take my cut, and then I'll give it to Gianluca to answer. I think as I look in at the tactics of what's going on right now, I think it's dangerous to say what changed quarter-over-quarter and extrapolate from there. You can draw straight lines, but I'm not sure that -- like whether we take a deal at the end of a quarter or not is a good way to think about what's going to happen over the long haul. We've said that pricing needs to go up or stabilize, depending on the different capacity points, the product transitions that we're going through, whether or not suppliers still want to stay around for a certain product line. I mean, there's a lot of different things to unpack there, to your point. Relative to our manufacturing capacity, we talked about 25%. Of course, that's not perfect across every single factory we have, nor is it perfect across the supply chain. And we're only as good as our weakest link. We have to make sure those weakest links are still well cared for. And so that's largely what's driving that. The ability to go put that capacity back online would -- is severely hampered because it's not just the capital, if you will, that we haven't invested in enough for peak capacity, but it's also the people we'd have to bring back. I mean, unfortunately, our people and a lot of people in the supply chain have been dramatically taken down. So do you want to add something, Gianluca?Gianluca RomanoYes, Aaron, you were asking about the price per terabyte in particular in Q4. That is a result also of the mix. So we have a reduction in cloud. That, of course, is our higher capacity that usually has the lowest price per terabyte, but also the lowest cost per terabyte. And we have an increase in VIA. So mid-capacity drives with, again, higher price per terabyte and a little bit higher cost per terabyte. So there is a mix that is impacting, of course, when the volume is not very high. Just a few exabyte difference in the different segments can swing those price and cost per terabyte. In terms of capacity, Aaron, the 25%, I would not take the peak of where we were probably more than a year ago. We have done a lot of restructuring, a lot of adjustments. And as they said, we will need time to eventually rebuild that capacity also in terms of employees.William David MosleyYes. We don't need to get back to the full capacity in order to get back into our margin model because we've taken so many cost actions across the business. I think we've been very, very aggressive on that, knowing that our footprint had to change. I think we'll be able to scale much better from a margin perspective as some of the demand comes back.OperatorThe next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Kurt Swartz] on for C.J. Open to delve into generative AI implications for both HDD and SSD demand. What is the perceived time line for storage demand uplift as data creation accelerates? And is there any concern regarding more workloads moving from HDD to flash within an AI data center paradigm?William David MosleyYes, thanks. I don't think of things that way that people in data centers are not making decisions like you would make for example, if you're building your own PC, this or that or this combination. Instead, they know how to manage data across multiple tiers and geographies very, very well. And make sure that the right data gets the right place at the right time. There are some gen AI discussions that are very transactional and probably don't need a whole lot of HDD and there's a lot that are very video-intensive and want data to be sequestered in a certain tank and so that nothing else can touch it. And we believe that's going to be that normal tier that you see today. So I think it's a win-win for memory and storage long term. Obviously, it's win for compute. And I think as some of these new applications are lit up, I'm really excited to see it. We haven't seen it yet. I mean, unless you start to look back at some traditional cloud service provider capabilities and say that all along that was AI. But I do think there's a whole host of new tools coming. It will be a very competitive space. And the data tiering infrastructure will become a critical part of that as we go forward.OperatorThe next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP.Karl AckermanI have 2 questions. First, I may have missed this, but why did average capacity per drives for the mass capacity area of your business shrink this quarter? And then second, I guess, how should we think about mass capacity unit growth from here? And where do you believe we are in the replacement cycle and whether that should continue to elongate or whether that returns to some form of normal from a unit perspective?William David MosleyThanks, Karl. So the -- we are not overbuilding, especially the high capacity drives are trying to push out into some of the cloud service providers. We're waiting until the inventory actually goes down. And so I think that's why -- and I made reference to this earlier, that's why some of the metrics may look weird, like you just pointed out on capacity per drive diving down. I don't think that's a long-term trend either. I think, of course, that's going to go back up.Gianluca RomanoYes. The average capacity is down because of mix. So as I said before, in the June quarter, we shipped less to cloud and more to VIA. And of course, the capacity is much higher in the cloud business.William David MosleyI'm sorry, Karl, what was the second part of your question?Karl AckermanYes. Sorry about that. It's about how we should think about mass capacity unit growth from here? And where do you believe we are in the replacement cycle? I asked because it appears your mass capacity unit shipments peaked in the first quarter of 2022. So it's been about 5 consecutive quarters of decline. At the same time, the units are down over 2/3 in that same period. And so if we could just discuss perhaps the corollary between units and exabyte growth. I think it's relevant here would be helpful.William David MosleyThere are hundreds of -- sorry, hundreds of millions of cloud drives, if you will, in data centers around the world. And some of them are aging to your point. And if unit shipments go down, exabytes can still go up even though unit shipments are going down because the ones that are aging off or lower capacity points, say, 4, 8, 12 terabytes whatever. But over time, it's much more efficient. Actually, it's more efficient power-wise and for a lot of other features, system-level features to put the newer drives on. So it's about all these things in balance. And I do believe that unit shipments are down largely because of this inventory digestion that we've been talking about. That will turn again. Will it go back to the peak of where it was 5 or 6 quarters ago and how fast will it go back? These are tough questions for our customers right now. It comes down to their prioritization of their spend. But all indications are in the latest numbers. And if I think about these latest numbers that the cloud service providers are announcing versus where they were 6 to 9 months ago, there is a very positive trend. And I think to the questions about gen AI and other feature sets, we're not a peak cloud yet. So I do think it will come back fairly strongly from a units perspective when it does.OperatorThe next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.Tristan GerraCouple of questions. The first one is about the production cost curve. And if you could talk about the percentage decline per year that we should expect in the medium term on a per bit basis? And then second question about is the percentage of production that's coming from China and also the true demand that you see from China as a percentage of your revenue?William David MosleyI think the relative -- I can answer the China question first and then Gianluca can take the cost discussion. China is down quite a bit, but relatively as part of our portfolio, it's about the same relative numbers that it was even when the peak of our portfolio. So I wouldn't overly analyze China versus CSPs versus consumer spending and all these other things that have affected our revenue downturn, I think it's a fairly consistent number across the entire portfolio. And we're looking for demand upswings in every one of those sections as well as we go forward, but we're also managing the business really carefully because we don't think it's going to come back in the next 6 months, like we said in our prepared remarks.Gianluca RomanoThe cost per terabyte of course, we don't guide the full year. What I would say is in a down cycle, it depends a lot from the level of utilization that you have in your factories, so can vary a lot from one quarter to another quarter. In general, no, we are continuing to do our product road map. And as Dave said, we have a new PMR product coming out soon, higher capacity, that means lower cost per terabyte. And then we will have HAMR in just a couple of quarters. So all those new products will help us in reducing the cost per terabyte.William David MosleyI like our chances in the cost per terabyte arena going forward. And I think as we continue to work yields and scrap on these new products and so on, have the highest capacity points out there, have the ability to take that areal density to lower capacity points as well, it helps our cost per terabyte immensely.OperatorThe next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.Mehdi HosseiniYes. A couple of follow-ups. Given your lower OpEx (inaudible) around to 160, how should I think about scaling, especially on the revenue side before you would need to increase OpEx materially?William David MosleyYes, Mehdi. I think we can hold the line on where we are right now and get a lot of scale. I mean we've been through the product transition far enough on the PMR product and HAMR product that we can -- we're pretty much done with the development phases, all the experimentation and so on and so forth. So I don't think we need to grow OpEx until we build back quite a bit of revenue and so we'll get very efficient scale there. I appreciate the question.Mehdi HosseiniAnd then for Gianluca, should I assume that free cash flow would be down in September and then up in December?Gianluca RomanoWell, in general, no, we have generated good free cash flow through all our quarters. I said in the prepared remarks, September would be a little bit lower because we have to pay for the restructuring charges that we executed in end of June and during July. But no, we also said we expect every quarter to be positive.Mehdi Hosseini(inaudible) negative, just sequentially, down in September and then rebounding in December on a sequential basis.Gianluca RomanoBetter. Yes, better point. On the [OpEx], I want to -- I just clarify, we don't have variable compensation right now in our numbers. So we could have a little bit of increase in the future if the business comes back stronger, just a little bit, not much.OperatorThe next question comes from Mark Miller with the Benchmark Company.Mark S. MillerI'm just wondering if -- it sounds like the PMR is going further than I originally thought it would be. Is this a change? Or was that always in your plan?William David MosleyIt was always in the plan. Yes. I think, Mark, we've kind of been focused on 16, 20, 24 and bringing on the technology that way. We believe we have great heads of media on PMR. It's getting towards the top end of the curve, right? So it's harder and harder to squeeze things out. And we've worked really hard to make sure that the drive that was taking us there would also take us to HAMR. So we're leveraging as much as we possibly can and then only changing the areal density critical components that get us the areal density to get us into the 30s and building much more confidence on that new S curve actually as time goes on. So I'm convinced there's going to be 40 terabyte drives in the world, not too distant future. And we've talked about the capabilities of these things in the lab. We're ready to go 5 terabytes per disk. So teams incrementally more positive every time. So that's good. The teams are making progress.Mark S. MillerIs there any specific technology advance that's allowing you to push that now up to almost 30 terabytes?William David MosleySorry, you mean beyond HAMR?Mark S. MillerI mean taking the PMR up to the high 20s in terms of terabytes, anything new in the technology and any breakthroughs or advancements.William David MosleyWell, we're always working new readers designs that are applicable to go to 30 and 40 terabyte drives as well. It's not only about the right technology, if you will. There's -- because PMR is implying the write technology. That's write with the [WRITE], you know that. So it's not a HAMR just versus PMR. There's other technology things that are being worked. Technology vectors are being worked. But mid-20s is CMR, high 20s has been SMR, and there's many different kinds of SMR variants for different customers. So I think you have to be a little bit careful with picking individual capacity points. And by the way, HAMR can use SMR as well on top of it. So when we get into the 30s, there might be that same kind of spread of capacity points because of how people are choosing to deploy HAMR in their data centers.OperatorThe last question today comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.Vijay Raghavan RakeshJust quick 2 questions. Just when you look at HAMR, obviously ramping well, any way of looking at what the exabyte mix would be as you look at calendar '24 or even calendar '25?William David MosleyYes. I do think that as we -- and this is a delicate balance between the capacity we'll still have to make drives, the lead times associated with those big drives and the economic returns that we're going to be getting, so how many do we start now, how many parts do we start now to be able to answer that. But theoretically, with HAMR allowing us to jump quite a bit in exabytes per box, if the demand is strong enough, then the exabyte growth will be strong, very strong. So a lot of this first order driver is still demand, we're going to answer that call with the components that we have. We're very much leaning into the product transition on HAMR because we have that much confidence. I think the customer's qualification is going well and the customer interest is high because they see such a market TCO proposition as well. And if all that stuff lines up into good box demand, like somebody asked earlier, that means good exabyte growth. That's what we're all hoping for.Vijay Raghavan RakeshGot it. And then on the data center inventory side, any way to kind of gauge how much -- how many weeks of inventory is still there? And how that compares to the prior (inaudible) I guess, in the inventory or...William David MosleyRight. It's not an exact science. I would say we have evidence that it's going down, not only that's what people are telling us, our customers are telling us, but also we're not putting any in. So definitely, the Seagate inventory is going down. We're even managing our owned inventory down as well, I can't speak for the rest of the industry. But all indications are that things are getting healthier and -- but we don't think that it's going to be fixed overnight. We think it's going to take another couple of quarters before the upturn. And that's something that I'm very cognizant of. We didn't project originally going into this downturn that this would be this long, but I don't think it's going to last forever either. I think it will turn north again here. We just basically said not until the end of the calendar year.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.William David MosleyThanks, [Betsy]. As you heard today, Seagate is continuing to take proactive actions to navigate this tough business environment over the near term. However, we remain excited as ever for the long-term opportunities for mass capacity storage, and it's brought about by existing and emerging trends that are underpinned by data like AI, like we talked about today. Our leading technology road map positions us really well to address future demand and enhance value for both our customers and for Seagate's financial performance. I'll close by thanking all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support. Thanks for joining us today.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.These non-GAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company’s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry.SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLCRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES(In millions, except per share amounts, gross margin and operating margin)(Unaudited)For the Three Months EndedFor the Twelve Months EndedJune 30,2023July 1,2022June 30,2023July 1,2022GAAP Gross Profit$304$759$1,351$3,469Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts3—601Amortization of acquired intangible assets—134Pandemic-related lockdown charges——7—Purchase order cancellation fees——108—Share-based compensation5112938Other charges1—3—Non-GAAP Gross Profit$313$771$1,561$3,512...GAAP Gross Margin19.0%28.9%18.3%29.7%Non-GAAP Gross Margin19.5%29.3%21.1%30.1%GAAP Operating Expenses$278$399$1,693$1,514Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts—(13)(25)(13)Amortization of acquired intangible assets—(2)(3)(11)BIS settlement penalty——(300)—Restructuring and other, net8(1)(102)(3)Share-based compensation(17)(28)(86)(107)Other charges(11)(6)(29)(10)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses$258$349$1,148$1,370GAAP (Loss) Income From Operations$26$360$(342)$1,955Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts3138514Amortization of acquired intangible assets—3615BIS settlement penalty——300—Pandemic-related lockdown charges——7—Purchase order cancellation fees——108—Restructuring and other, net(8)11023Share-based compensation2239115145Other charges1263210Non-GAAP Income From Operations$55$422$413$2,142GAAP Operating Margin1.6%13.7%(4.6)%16.8%Non-GAAP Operating Margin3.4%16.1%5.6%18.4%GAAP Net (Loss) Income$(92)$276$(529)$1,649Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts3138514Amortization of acquired intangible assets—3615BIS settlement penalty——300—Net loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt17—(190)1Pandemic-related lockdown charges——7—Purchase order cancellation fees——108—Restructuring and other, net(8)11023Share-based compensation2239115145Strategic investment losses or impairment charges961012Other charges1263210Income tax adjustments—1(6)(16)Non-GAAP Net (Loss) Income$(37)$345$40$1,833GAAP Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share$(0.44)$1.27$(2.56)$7.36Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts0.010.060.410.06Amortization of acquired intangible assets—0.010.030.07BIS settlement penalty——1.45—Net loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt0.08—(0.91)—Pandemic-related lockdown charges——0.03—Purchase order cancellation fees——0.52—Restructuring and other, net(0.04)—0.490.01Share-based compensation0.110.180.560.65Strategic investment losses or impairment charges0.040.030.050.05Other charges0.060.040.150.05Income tax adjustments——(0.03)(0.07)Non-GAAP Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share1$(0.18)$1.59$0.19$8.18Shares used in diluted net (loss) income per share calculationGAAP207217207224Non-GAAP207217209224GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities$218$180$942$1,657Acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements5072316381Free Cash Flow$168$108$626$1,2761 For the three months ended June 30, 2023, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net loss per share were computed using weighted average basic shares of 207 million, as a result of the net loss reported during the period.

Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company’s acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.BIS settlement penaltyThe Company accrued a settlement penalty of $300 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 related to the alleged violations of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations between August 17, 2020 and September 29, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (""BIS""), which were subsequently resolved by a settlement agreement on April 18, 2023. This settlement penalty is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company's current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.Net loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debtFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments. The gains and losses represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished less the write-off of any unamortized debt issuance costs and discount. Fees include certain costs associated with a debt extinguishment or modification. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.Pandemic-related lockdown chargesPandemic-related lockdown charges are factory under-utilization costs incurred due to the pandemic-related lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Purchase order cancellation feesPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Restructuring and other, netRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company’s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company’s ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Share-based compensationThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company’s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.Strategic investment losses or impairment chargesFrom time to time, the Company incurs losses, gains or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Other chargesThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Income tax adjustmentsProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.Free cash flowFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance.EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDAEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net gain recognized from early redemption of debt, pandemic-related lockdown charges, purchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, share-based compensation, strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges and BIS settlement penalty. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as the total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the Company’s debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726844940/en/ContactsInvestor Relations Contact: Shanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600shanye.hudson@seagate.comMedia Contact: Gregory Belloni, (415) 235-9092gregory.belloni@seagate.com]"

On the top line, sales came in 4% above estimates at $6.24 billion.

441,c46d7a0a-c4ad-3e03-a457-bdab92b46206,UPS,2023-07-27,5 early takeaways from UPS-Teamsters agreement,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-early-takeaways-ups-teamsters-152809741.html,1690385289,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS', 'AMZN']","[Five early takeaways from UPS-Teamsters agreement (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)By Alan AmlingEditor’s note: The dust has barely settled on the tentative five-year contract reached Tuesday by UPS Inc. and the Teamsters union. There is no shortage of opinions. One of the more informed is that of Alan Amling, who spent 27 years at UPS, retiring in 2019 as vice president of corporate strategy. Today, Amling (pictured) is an assistant professor of practice at the University of Tennessee’s Haslam School of Business. Below are Amling’s five takeaways from the tentative agreement between UPS and the Teamsters union. These originally appeared on LinkedIn and have been edited to conform with FreightWaves’ style.1. There is a clear winner, and it’s not UPS or the Teamsters, it’s the US economy Anderson Economic Group, which calculates the economic impact of labor actions, estimated the impact of a 10-day strike, which was not expected to be long in duration had a work stoppage occurred, at $7 billion. The first and only UPS strike in 1997 lasted 15 days. Given the strong growth in parcel demand due to e-commerce, which barely existed in 1997, the cost to the economy would have been exponential had this work stoppage lasted longer than 10 days.UPS will try to pass on much of the increase in costs to shippers and consumers. That will be inflationary. But a settlement is not nearly as inflationary as a strike where demand would outstrip capacity in the parcel market.2. For the Teamsters, it was ‘mission accomplished’ but …The Teamsters checked all its boxes and came away with a strong contract it can leverage to organize Amazon.com Inc. warehouse workers. The Teamster rank and file will likely approve this.Current UPS Teamsters will benefit from this agreement, but few new Teamster jobs will be added. Nonetheless, this agreement will add momentum to union popularity, which already is at its highest approval rating since 1965.Teamster General President Sean O’Brien said UPS (NYSE: UPS) put in “30 billion of new money.” I’m estimating about $20 billion in new operating expenses on the high side over five years, which is significant. That’s a 35% increase over five years, or about 6% per year.Story continues3. UPS is signaling an acceleration of its ‘better not bigger’ strategy with this agreementThe most telling part of the agreement was UPS’ commitment to only add 30,000 Teamster jobs (7,500 new full-time jobs and filling 22,500 open positions) over the next five years. That is an increase of less than 2% per year. In the previous five years, UPS added 100,000 Teamster jobs, or 7% per year.Look for UPS to lean into B2B and away from B2C. If UPS wanted to be a leader in e-commerce shipping, it would have fought harder to increase its use of contractors and gig workers. The agreement gives union members the right of first refusal to use personal delivery vehicles during seasonal periods.As wages rise, the relative cost of technology decreases. Look for UPS to aggressively add automation and robotics to increase efficiency.4. FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service and regional carriers will benefit If UPS tries to raise rates in line with its cost increase, lower-cost rivals can match the increase to boost their profits. Alternatively, they can leverage their lower-cost networks with smaller rate increases to take share.There are risks to FedEx Corp., (NYSE: FDX) UPS’ chief rival. The pay disparity with UPS drivers and warehouse workers will widen. This may fuel resentment on the part of FedEx contractors and drivers and challenge the FedEx Ground independent contractor classification. It may also put into question why FedEx and UPS are governed under different labor laws. FedEx is under the Railway Labor Act, and UPS is governed by the National Labor Relations Act, under which it is easier to unionize and to take self-help actions such as a work stoppage.5. The big 3 e-commerce retailers will get bigger Amazon Logistics (NASDAQ:AMZN) already delivers more parcels per year in the U.S. than FedEx and will pass UPS over the next year as UPS continues to shed low-value e-commerce volume, including that of Amazon, UPS’ largest individual customer.Ship from store and buy online pickup in store (BOPIS) will become even more attractive. Small to midsize shippers and rural businesses and consumers will see the largest increase in shipping costs and should look hard at bundling shipments in multiple geographies to lower overall costs.The post 5 early takeaways from UPS-Teamsters agreement appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The company's workers have until Aug. 22 to vote on the tentative deal.While the delivery firm has managed to avert a strike, analysts expect the contract would raise overall labor inflation, pressuring the outlook for the year and also weighing on margins at a time when the industry is reeling from waning demand.""Considering a backdrop of meaningful inflation, we believe UPS will need to deliver on pricing gains and productivity to provide visibility to margin performance looking forward,"" UBS analyst Thomas Wadewitz said.Rival FedEx has been slashing costs to protect profits amid waning demand.BMO analyst Fadi Chamoun added that the real question is whether the industry's competitive backdrop supports sufficient pricing power to enable UPS to sustain or improve upon its current operating margins.Meanwhile, other unions cheered the outcome. Commenting on the deal, the president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union said, ""The Teamsters also put an end to tiers. Equal pay for equal work has to apply everywhere, whether you work at Big Brown or the Big Three.""UAW, which kicked off contract talks with the Detroit Three automakers earlier this month, is also pushing them to eliminate the two-tier wage system under which new hires earn as much as 25% less than veterans.

448,40af3275-9963-31a3-86ed-772bc100c9b6,AXP,2023-07-27,Here is What to Know Beyond Why American Express Company (AXP) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-american-express-130007656.html,1690376407,STORY,['AXP'],"[American Express (AXP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this credit card issuer and global payments company have returned -1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, to which American Express belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.American Express is expected to post earnings of $3.01 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.14 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.1%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.50 indicates a change of +12.2% from what American Express is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, American Express is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of American Express, the consensus sales estimate of $15.46 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The $61.01 billion and $66.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.4% and +9.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Express reported revenues of $15.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.89 for the same period compares with $2.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.34%. The EPS surprise was +3.21%.Over the last four quarters, American Express surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Express is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Express. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Never miss another market-moving headline.Target stock falls on Raymond James downgradeTarget (NYSE:TGT) was downgraded by Raymond James to Market Perform from Outperform, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.The analyst believes the retailer is losing momentum in its revenue numbers, and also voiced concerns about macro trends:Our change in opinion reflects our belief that [quarter-to-date] sales &amp; traffic trends... have remained soft after taking a step down early in the quarter and suggest Target is losing topline momentum. In addition, we have seen further indications that overall consumer discretionary spending (more important for TGT’s mix of products) was weak during F2Q— creating greater potential for a higher promotional environment and consumables mix and ultimately delaying Target’s margin recovery story (key part of our prior thesis).Earlier this month, TD Cowen cut its price target on the company to $166 from $200, noting that risks for the retailer may persist as the consumer shift is driving the downside. And last month, the company was downgraded by Citi, KeyBanc, and JPMorgan as well.Target is set to report its Q2/24 earnings on Aug 16. Street estimates stand at $1.58 for EPS and $25.62 billion for revenues.Shares lost ground in premarket trading, but were recently ticking up fractionally at $133.75 in the regular session.Goldman Sachs cut to Neutral at CitiGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) shares fell more than 1% yesterday after Citi downgraded the company to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $400.00 (from $370.00), noting that the valuation is ahead of itself.At its recent analyst day, the management set a target of 15-17% ROTCE and introduced several KPIs to monitor their progress. According to Citi, last week’s Q2 earnings results showed continued advancement in meeting these KPIs, even though the adjusted return was a moderate 9%.Story continuesWhile we view the ROTCE target as achievable, we also believe it will take time as well as a better investment banking environment where GS is very levered to in GBM (investment banking highest return business) and AWM (via higher incentive fees/harvesting of gains on its on-balance sheet investments).2 more downgrades DZ Bank downgraded American Express (NYSE:AXP) from Buy to Hold with a price target of $180.00 following last week’s Q2 results, highlighted by an EPS beat but lower-than-expected revenues. This represents the second downgrade for American Express this week.BofA Securities downgraded Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $226.00 from $270.00 ahead of the company’s Q2 earnings announcement tomorrow.We expect TSCO to report an earnings miss and cut guidance given a fading tailwind from inflation and worsening demand for discretionary categories.Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

(NYSE: MLM) (“Martin Marietta” or the “Company”), a leading national supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.Second-Quarter Highlights(Financial highlights are for continuing operations)  Quarter Ended June 30,(In millions, except per share) 2023  2022  % ChangeTotal revenues 1 $1,820.8  $1,641.7  10.9%Gross profit $560.4  $425.2  31.8%Earnings from operations 2 $463.3  $478.6  (3.2)%Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta 2 $347.6  $353.2  (1.6)%Adjusted EBITDA 3 $596.1  $478.3  24.6%Earnings per diluted share from continuing  operations 2 $5.60  $5.65  (0.9)%Total revenues include the sales of products and services to customers (net of any discounts or allowances) and freight revenues.Quarter ended June 30, 2022 earnings from operations, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations include $151.7 million, $108.1 million and $1.73 per diluted share, respectively, for a nonrecurring gain on a divestiture.Earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates, acquisition and integration expenses and a nonrecurring gain on a divestiture, or Adjusted EBITDA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta.Story continuesWard Nye, Chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “Martin Marietta delivered exceptional performance across nearly every safety, financial and operational measure in the second quarter. These impressive results, despite lower aggregates shipments, demonstrate the success of our value-over-volume commercial strategy and the durability of our business model through various macroeconomic conditions. Our second-quarter results, together with our expectations for an even stronger next six months, underpin our revised full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.0 – $2.1 billion, a 28 percent increase at the midpoint as compared with the prior year.”“As record-setting public funds for infrastructure and manufacturing begin to enter the U.S. economy, we continue to expect that aggregates demand will accelerate in the second half of 2023. This well-chronicled increased investment should largely offset the current residential construction air pocket, which we expect to bottom in the third quarter of 2023.”Mr. Nye concluded, “This scenario, combined with continued commercial momentum and moderating cost inflation, should contribute to a record-setting year in 2023 and provide a solid foundation for an even brighter 2024 and beyond. Our fidelity to safety, enterprise excellence, sustainable business practices and execution of our strategic plan reinforces our confidence in Martin Marietta’s ability to consistently deliver superior shareholder value.”Mr. Nye’s CEO Commentary and Market Perspective can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.Second-Quarter Financial and Operating Results(All financial and operating results are for continuing operations and comparisons are versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise noted)Building Materials BusinessThe Building Materials business generated record quarterly revenues $1.74 billion, an 11.6 percent increase.

In addition, these are some of the factors the Company uses in internal evaluations of the overall performance of its businesses. Management acknowledges that there are many items that impact a company’s reported results and the adjustments reflected in these non-GAAP measures are not intended to present all items that may have impacted these results. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Conference Call InformationThe Company will discuss its second-quarter 2023 earnings results on a conference call and an online webcast today (July 27, 2023).

the termination, capping and/or reduction or suspension of the federal and/or state fuel tax(es) or other revenue related to public construction; the level and timing of federal, state or local transportation or infrastructure or public projects funding and any issues arising with such federal and state budgets, most particularly in Texas, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Georgia, Minnesota, Iowa, Florida, Indiana and Arizona; the United States Congress’ inability to reach agreement among themselves or with the Administration on policy issues that impact the federal budget; the ability of states and/or other entities to finance approved projects either with tax revenues or alternative financing structures; levels of construction spending in the markets the Company serves; a reduction in defense spending and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in energy-related construction activity resulting from suspension of the fuel tax or a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns or capital spending, particularly in Texas and West Virginia; increasing residential mortgage interest rates and other factors that could result in a slowdown in residential construction; unfavorable weather conditions, particularly Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico storm and hurricane activity, wildfires, the late start to spring or the early onset of winter and the impact of a drought or excessive rainfall in the markets served by the Company, any of which can significantly affect production schedules, volumes, product and/or geographic mix and profitability; the volatility of fuel costs, particularly diesel fuel and the impact on the cost, or the availability generally, of other consumables, namely steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts, and with respect to the Company’s Magnesia Specialties business, natural gas;

increasing governmental regulation, including environmental laws and climate change regulations; transportation availability or a sustained reduction in capital investment by the railroads, notably the availability of railcars, locomotive power and the condition of rail infrastructure to move trains to supply the Company’s Texas, Colorado, Florida, Carolinas and Gulf Coast markets, including the movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan and its customers; increased transportation costs, including increases from higher or fluctuating passed-through energy costs or fuel surcharges, and other costs to comply with tightening regulations, as well as higher volumes of rail and water shipments; availability of trucks and licensed drivers for transport of the Company’s materials; availability and cost of construction equipment in the United States; weakening in the steel industry markets served by the Company’s dolomitic lime products; trade disputes with one or more nations impacting the U.S. economy, including the impact of tariffs on the steel industry; unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers that introduce volatility to earnings, including that of the Magnesia Specialties business that is running at capacity; proper functioning of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support operations; inflation and its effect on both production and interest costs; the concentration of customers in construction markets and the increased risk of potential losses on customer receivables; the impact of the level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and management of production costs on the operating leverage and therefore profitability of the Company; the possibility that the expected synergies from acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, including achieving anticipated profitability to maintain compliance with the Company’s leverage ratio debt covenant; changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such laws and/or administrative practices, including acquisitions or divestitures, that would increase the Company’s tax rate; violation of the Company’s debt covenant if price and/or volumes return to previous levels of instability;

If you want to skip the details, head straight to the 8 Most Famous Bridges in the US. The United States is home to numerous iconic bridges that have made the country's traffic flow better. Among the most famous bridges in the US, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is a symbol of innovation and resilience. Besides boasting an overpowering design, the bridge also works as a transportation link between San Francisco and Marin County. Similarly, the Brooklyn Bridge, completed in 1883, was the world's first steel-wire suspension bridge that facilitated transport between Manhattan and Brooklyn when there were limited commute means. Besides being direct commute routes, these structures often carry utilities like water pipes and power lines, contributing to the country's infrastructure backbone. In urban settings, bridges help mitigate traffic congestion by working as alternative routes or layering traffic vertically.We have recently covered 25 Most Famous Bridges In The World; explore these structural marvels to expand your knowledge of the architecture around you.Overview of The United States' Bridge and Road Infrastructure Critical infrastructure like the road network and bridges is fundamental for the United States as they contribute to economic progress. The bridge industry is a subset of the broader infrastructure sector and has been an integral element in shaping the dynamics of the transportation system. Bridge construction in the US is characterized by over 600,000 bridges that elevate the economy's connectedness and mobility. The US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has estimated that over 4 billion vehicles cross US bridges daily, signifying their crucial role in facilitating the seamless movement of goods, services, and people.Story continuesBesides serving as fundamental links for commuting, bridges act as catalysts for economic activity by reducing travel time and distance, eventually enhancing logistics and supply chain efficiency. For instance, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Brooklyn Bridge in New York are iconic structures that uplift local economies through tourism and make commuting in these densely populated areas easier. However, the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2021 Infrastructure Report Card rated the nation's bridges at a ""C,"" as 42% of these bridges are at least 50 years old. The bridges being more than 50 years old mean they are structurally deficient and need repair. The same report suggested that an estimated $125 billion is required to rehabilitate and preserve the existing inventory of bridges. As of current, the country's spending on bridge rehabilitation is $14.4 billion, which is mostly spent on surface repairs. However, in light of a detailed structural analysis, ASCE suggests that the country's budget should be $22.7 billion annually to manage bridges. Although around 37 states have increased their gas tax in the past decade, the need to uphold these old structures requires more effort. As the most famous bridges in the US age, the country's focus is on maintaining their integrity instead of adding more bridges to the network. In this aspect, companies like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM), and Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) are some of the biggest names. For instance, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) supplies crushed stone, sand, and gravel used in construction applications, including the maintenance of roads and bridges. Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) also produces asphalt and ready-mixed concrete used in infrastructure projects like bridges, overpasses, and roadways.Likewise, Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) is the United States' largest producer of construction aggregates, i.e., crushed stone, sand, and gravel. These aggregates form a significant component of construction materials used for building and maintaining infrastructure, including roads and bridges. Also, Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) produces materials for roadway construction and maintenance of paving highways, parking lots, and airport runways.  If we talk about the equipment used in road and bridge upkeep, Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) is unrivaled. Being the largest manufacturer of construction equipment, Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) is often directly or indirectly involved in ensuring these crucial structures' safety. Furthermore, the Biden administration's $1 trillion infrastructure investment plan, passed in 2021, also depicts the importance of the infrastructure industry. Out of the announced $1 trillion, $110 billion will be spent on road and bridge betterment and $66 billion for freight and passenger rail, among other projects. Which Is The Longest Bridge In The USA?Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, in Louisiana, is the longest bridge in the USA. It is a twin-span bridge consisting of two parallel structures, and its total length is approximately 23.83 miles (almost 38350 meters). Its parallel bridge configuration was adopted to facilitate better traffic flow and to allow for routine maintenance without significant disruption to commuters. The Causeway is operated by the Greater New Orleans Expressway Commission (also called the Causeway Commission), a body that was created by the Louisiana Legislature in 1952. Let's now move toward the 25 most famous bridges in the United States.25 Most Famous Bridges In The US25 Most Famous Bridges In The USOur Methodology We selected the 25 most famous bridges in the US according to their significance in history and traffic management. We believe that a structural entity's history determines its fame, and that's why we ranked the most popular US bridges according to the time they were opened for public use in ascending order of fame.So, here are the most popular bridges in the US:25. Mario Cuomo Bridge (Replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge), NY - 2017The Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that replaced the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River in New York. The bridge was completed in 2017 and was officially named in honor of the 52nd Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, father of Andrew Cuomo, who was governor at the time of the bridge's completion.24. Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, St. Louis, MO - 2014The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge is also a cable bridge across the Mississippi River between St. Clair County, Illinois, and St. Louis, Missouri. The bridge was named after Stan Musial, a baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals who was widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport and in honor of the service of all veterans.23. Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, NV/AZ - 2010The Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge is a steel and concrete arch bridge in the United States that spans the Colorado River between Arizona and Nevada. The structure was completed in 2010 and is located within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and its construction was part of the Hoover Dam Bypass project. The bridge is named for Mike O'Callaghan, the Governor of Nevada from 1971–1979, and Pat Tillman, a football player who left his career with the Arizona Cardinals to enlist in the United States Army and was later killed in Afghanistan.22. Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, Charleston, SC - 2005The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge was opened in 2005 to connect Charleston and Mount Pleasant in South Carolina. The bridge stands over the Cooper River, and its 471-meter-long main span is the third longest among cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. The bridge, which has a total length of 4000 meters, was built to replace the structurally deficient Grace Memorial Bridge and Silas N. Pearman Bridge.21. Sidney Lanier Bridge, Brunswick, GA - 2003The Sidney Lanier Bridge spans the Brunswick River in Georgia. At 148 meters in height, it is the tallest bridge in the state, and its main span is 381 meters long. The bridge was constructed to replace an older, unsafe vertical-lift bridge and resolved critical transportation issues by allowing larger vessels to navigate the shipping channel below with fewer restrictions.20. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge, Boston, MA - 2003The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge is a part of Boston's Big Dig project, one of the most extensive highway projects in the US. The cable-stayed bridge has a total length of 4,366 meters and a maximum height of 82 meters. It pays tribute to Boston's historical role in the American Revolution with its design inspired by the Bunker Hill Monument.19. Al Zampa Memorial Bridge, Vallejo, CA - 2003The Al Zampa Memorial Bridge, officially opened in 2003, is a vital suspension bridge in Vallejo, California. The structure is named in honor of ironworker Al Zampa who worked on several of the area's notable bridges and spanned 1,056 meters across the Carquinez Strait. Its inauguration resolved traffic congestion issues significantly on the old Carquinez Bridge. It is also the only bridge in the country that is named after a blue-collar worker, aimed to regard the workers' contribution to CA's infrastructure. 18. Sunshine Skyway Bridge, St. Petersburg, FL - 1987The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in the US. It has been gracing the horizon of St. Petersburg, Florida, since 1987. It's renowned for its distinctive yellow cables that make it a recognizable symbol of the region, and has a total length of 6,663 meters and a height of 131 meters. The bridge directly routes Tampa Bay and minimizes the distance between St. Petersburg and Terra Ceia.17. New River Gorge Bridge, Fayetteville, WV - 1977 The New River Gorge Bridge WAS completed in 1977 in the Appalachian Mountains of Fayetteville, West Virginia. The engineering feat stands 267 meters above the New River and has a total length of 924 meters. The completion of the bridge reduced a 40-minute drive down narrow mountain roads to a mere minute. It also holds the distinction of being one of the highest vehicular bridges in the world.16. Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, New York, NY - 1964The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in America. It spans the Narrows Strait in New York. At its opening in 1964, it was the world's longest suspension bridge, with a main span of 1,298 meters. It is named after explorer Giovanni da Verrazano and provides a critical link between Staten Island and Brooklyn. However, its construction displaced numerous residents and raised issues about the social impacts of infrastructure development.15. Mackinac Bridge, Mackinaw City, MI - 1957The Mackinac Bridge, often called ""Mighty Mac,"" is an iconic symbol of Michigan's unity that links Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas. The bridge boasts a length of approximately 8,038 meters and a maximum height of 168 meters. The five-mile-long bridge was opened in 1957 over the Straits of Mackinac to offer a year-round connection that previously relied on winter ice bridges or ferries. Despite its utility, it is known for high winds that occasionally necessitate escorts for drivers.14. Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Metairie, LA - 1956 &amp; 1969The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Metairie, LA, holds a Guinness World Record for the longest bridge over water (continuous), at 38,442 meters. It consists of two parallel bridges, built in 1956 and 1969, which reduced travel time around the lake and spurred economic growth in the region. However, it has been a focal point of discussions about sustainability and environmental impact due to concerns about coastal erosion.13. Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Annapolis, MD - 1952The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, formally known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, opened up to public in 1952. It is a key architectural marvel in Annapolis, Maryland, with a massive length of 28,300 meters. The bridge links Maryland's rural Eastern Shore region and the urban Western Shore. The dual-span bridge significantly reduced travel time across the Chesapeake Bay, but its narrow lanes often pose traffic congestion problems.12. Tacoma Narrows Bridge, Tacoma, WA - 1940/1950The Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Tacoma, Washington, is more notable for its predecessor's collapse in 1940, known as ""Galloping Gertie."" The original 1940 bridge was an engineering failure due to an aeroelastic flutter that caused a spectacular collapse merely four months post-completion. The current suspension bridge, whose length is 1810 meters, exemplifies lessons learned in bridge aerodynamics.11. Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, CA - 1937San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge one of the most famous and popular bridges in the US because it symbolizes American ingenuity. The bridge's total length is about 2,737 meters, and it was the world's longest suspension bridge at its completion. Its Art Deco design and ""International Orange"" color have made it a cultural icon. The bridge connects San Francisco to Marin County, previously only accessible by ferry. 10. San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, San Francisco, CA - 1936The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge spans 7,180 meters and connects San Francisco to Oakland, California. The double-decked suspension bridge is notable for its distinct eastern and western spans that revolutionized transportation in the Bay Area. However, the bridge's significance is marred by its vulnerability to seismic activity, a factor underscored by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which led to the replacement of the eastern span.9. Bixby Creek Bridge, Big Sur, CA - 1932Sitting 85 meters above Bixby Creek in Big Sur, California, the Bixby Creek Bridge is a reinforced concrete open-spandrel arch bridge. Its length extends to 218 meters, which were constructed to replace the treacherous Old Coast Road and significantly reduce travel time.Click to continue reading 8 Most Famous Bridges In The US.Suggested Articles:15 Most Profitable Toll Roads In The World15 Most Luxurious Airlines in the World20 Countries With The Best ArchitectureDisclosure: None. 25 Most Famous Bridges In The US is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Martin Marietta (MLM) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.85 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on July 27, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $4.85 Most Accurate Estimate and the $4.83 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Martin Marietta has an Earnings ESP of 0.41%.MLM is one of just a large database of Construction stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Howmet (HWM).Howmet, which is readying to report earnings on August 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.44 a share, and HWM is six days out from its next earnings report.Howmet's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.99% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43.Story continuesMLM and HWM's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

MLM, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Martin Marietta is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MLM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $4.85 per share for MLM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.83 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MLM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.41% heading into earnings season.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MLM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Martin Marietta, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.16 billion, down 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.76% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NiSource?For NiSource, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NiSource will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NiSource would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NiSource doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, WEC Energy Group (WEC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.17 billion, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for WEC Energy has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WEC Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

We are equally as excited about the Transformation initiatives that have taken hold this year with the compounding effects as each new wave within pricing, sourcing, operational excellence and organizational effectiveness is implemented. We are also encouraged by our innovation pipeline and how we can Make Better Essential through our products and solutions, for people and our planet by helping our customers move, improve and enjoy water.""Second quarter 2023 operating income was $209 million, up 9 percent compared to operating income for the second quarter of 2022, and return on sales (""ROS"") was 19.3 percent, an increase of 140 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2022.

This year marks the 47th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.OUTLOOKMr. Stauch concluded, ""We are increasing our EPS guidance reflecting a strong first half of 2023 driven by the diversification of our smart, sustainable water business and long-term strategy while recognizing that we continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher interest rates and inflation. While we continue to expect 2023 to be a softer year for our Pool sales due to lower demand in new pools and channel inventory correction, we believe the power of our diversified portfolio demonstrates that we can drive sustained growth and profitability. We believe Pool remains a very attractive segment led by migration to sunbelt states, automation of existing pools and energy efficient and more sustainable product offerings. I would also like to add that we are very proud of our Pentair team who has demonstrated resilience and fortitude to continuously deliver for our customers and shareholders throughout very unusual operating conditions.""The company increases its estimated 2023 GAAP EPS from continuing operations to approximately $3.27 to $3.37 and on an adjusted EPS basis to approximately $3.65 to $3.75. The company maintained full year 2023 sales guidance to be down approximately 2 percent to flat on a reported basis. The company expects full year free cash flow to approximate 100 percent of net income.In addition, the company introduces third quarter 2023 GAAP EPS from continuing operations guidance of approximately $0.77 to $0.82 and on an adjusted EPS basis of approximately $0.84 to $0.89. The company expects third quarter sales to be down approximately 7 percent on a reported basis compared to the third quarter of 2022.EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALLPentair President and Chief Executive Officer John L.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230727281593/en/Net Sales Increase of 7.2% to $4.18 Billion with Comparable Store Sales Increase of 2.5%, Led by Comparable Transaction Growth of 1.8%Diluted Earnings per Share Growth of 8.5% to $3.83Announces New Long-Term Target of 3,000 Stores in the U.S. and Plan to Increase Annual New Store Openings to 90 per Year""As has been well documented, U.S. consumer spending on goods is moderating. Additionally, our business was further impacted by seasonal underperformance, particularly in June. Consequently, our second quarter results, while solid, were below our expectations. My thanks and appreciation go out to our 52,000 Tractor Supply Team Members. Through their efforts, we delivered record customer service scores and positive comparable transaction growth in the quarter. Given our first half performance and our view that our customers will continue to be discerning in their spending for the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our full year outlook,"" said Hal Lawton, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tractor Supply.""We believe we have a robust, distinct business model in an attractive market. We have achieved remarkable growth and market share gains over the last three plus years. We remain excited about the many vectors that exist for us to expand our competitive advantages and deliver attractive growth. Today, based on market insights, we are announcing an increase to our long-term store target to 3,000 organic sites. Additionally, we are announcing our intention to increase our annual new store openings to 90 beginning in 2025 with 2024 being a transition year. With significant share opportunity in a total addressable market of more than $180 billion, we have a long growth runway ahead of us as we continue to execute on our Life Out Here strategy,"" said Lawton.Story continuesSecond Quarter 2023 ResultsNet sales for the second quarter of 2023 increased 7.2% to $4.18 billion from $3.90 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The increase in net sales was driven by contributions from the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, new store openings and growth in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales increased 2.5%, as compared to an increase of 5.5% in the prior year’s second quarter, driven by comparable average transaction count increase of 1.8% and comparable average ticket growth of 0.6%. Comparable store sales growth reflects continued strength in core year-round merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible (""C.U.E."") products which significantly outpaced the chain average. This performance offset softness in demand for seasonal goods and declines in big-ticket items.Gross profit increased 9.3% to $1.51 billion from $1.39 billion in the prior year’s second quarter, and gross margin increased 69 basis points to 36.2% from 35.5% in the prior year’s second quarter. Gross margin continued to benefit from the Company’s ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy to manage the impact of year-over-year product cost inflation. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs driven by improvement in the global supply chain and efficiencies from a new distribution center, modestly offset by negative product mix.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 10.9% to $955.4 million from $861.2 million in the prior year’s second quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 77 basis points to 22.8% from 22.1% in the second quarter of 2022. The increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the Company’s planned growth investments which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of a new distribution center. Additionally, higher medical claims contributed to the increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales.Operating income increased 6.5% to $559.3 million from $525.0 million in the second quarter of 2022.The effective income tax rate improved to 23.0% compared to 23.5% in the second quarter of 2022.Net income increased 6.2% to $421.2 million from $396.5 million, and diluted earnings per share was $3.83 compared to $3.53 in the second quarter of 2022.The Company repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock for $153.9 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $112.8 million, returning $266.7 million of capital to shareholders in the second quarter of 2023.The Company opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and three new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the second quarter of 2023.Real Estate Strategy UpdateTractor Supply announced today an update to the Company’s long-term store opportunity and several new real estate programs that leverage the strength of its balance sheet and real estate portfolio. These announcements create a longer runway for growth and strengthen the Company’s financial model.Based on its market analysis, the Company is establishing a new target of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the U.S., an increase of 200 locations from its prior guidance. Additionally, the Company anticipates accelerating its annual new store growth to approximately 90 stores per year beginning in 2025, with a step up to 80 new stores in 2024.Tractor Supply is also updating its real estate development and portfolio management strategy for its store real estate to include owned development and sale-leaseback capability. The owned development program enables the Company to capture incremental cost savings through a fixed fee model and have more control in the development process of new stores. The Company currently anticipates executing a sale-leaseback transaction of new stores built under this program within a reasonable time after construction is completed.Additionally, the Company plans to periodically execute the sale-leaseback of its existing ownership of 117 stores to fund the cash required by the new development program and to capture the value of its existing real estate. The benefit from the new development program is anticipated to more than offset the incremental rent expense from the sale-leaseback of Company’s currently owned stores. The expectation is that the sale-leaseback of existing stores would be executed routinely over approximately the next eight to 10 years, beginning this year. Given this approach, the total number of Company-owned stores is anticipated to remain relatively stable and consistent over time. For 2023, the Company expects an after-tax benefit of approximately $0.20 of diluted earnings per share anticipated in the second half of the year from the sale-leaseback of 10 to 15 stores. A similar benefit is anticipated to be achieved each year over the near term.Fiscal 2023 Financial OutlookThe Company is updating its fiscal 2023 financial guidance to reflect its performance from the first half of the year along with its expectations for the remainder of the year, including the positive impact of the updates to the real estate portfolio strategy. The updated fiscal 2023 guidance includes the benefit of the sale-leaseback.For fiscal 2023, the Company now expects the following:UpdatedPreviousNet Sales$14.8 billion - $14.9 billion$15.0 billion - $15.3 billionComparable Store Sales+1.3% - +2.5%+3.5% - +5.5%Operating Margin Rate10.2% - 10.3%10.1% - 10.3%Net Income$1.12 billion - $1.15 billion$1.13 billion - $1.17 billionEarnings per Diluted Share$10.20 - $10.40$10.30 - $10.60In light of the updates to the Company’s real estate strategy, anticipated capital expenditures for the year are now forecasted to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million, compared to its prior range of $700 million to $775 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects the implementation of the development program for new store growth that will be fully funded through the sale of existing Company-owned stores. Additionally, capital plans for 2023 include opening a total of approximately 70 Tractor Supply stores, completing the Orscheln Farm and Home conversions to Tractor Supply, continuing the Project Fusion remodels and garden center transformations, building of its 10th distribution center and opening a total of 10 to 15 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores.Conference Call InformationTractor Supply Company will hold a conference call today, Thursday, July 27, 2023 at 10 a.m. ET.

Importers of coffee, cocoa, beef, soy, rubber and palm oil must prove their supply chains aren't contributing to the destruction of forests, a cause of climate change, or be fined up to 4% of their turnover in the bloc.Several major investors told Reuters last month that concerns about their exposure to the issue could lead them to quit consumer goods makers with ""risky"" supply chains.""It will be very difficult to implement this law in practical terms, because the coffee supply chain is very complex and traceability is very difficult,"" Lavazza Group Chairman Giuseppe Lavazza told Reuters. ""We are talking to the European authorities through our association to try to find a way.""The EU rules will be hard to implement without more guidance, Lavazza said, pointing to the large number of intermediaries involved in coffee.""These inherent characteristics of the coffee supply chain make traceability at the parcel level a huge challenge for the sector, as information on geolocation and contacts may not be available for small plantations,"" he added.Christophe Hansen, who led negotiations on the law for the European Parliament, said: ""I don't think it's impossible. It will be a challenge for them for sure because coffee sector producers are often quite small.Story continues""But we have integrated into the text (of the law) the obligation of the European Commission to help especially small-holder farmers to be able to comply with the requirements.""Oreo-maker Mondelez told Reuters it is ""not clear on how they (EU authorities) will control or implement this"" law.""There should be more dialogue about how do we practically make something happen on the ground,"" Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said in an interview with Reuters last month.The EU says it introduced its landmark deforestation law because years of voluntary commitments by food companies to rid their supply chains of environmental harms had largely failed to have an impact on the ground.Non-profit organisations including Earthsight, Fern and Solidaridad said the law mostly requires companies to put into action their voluntary pledges to stop sourcing from deforested areas.""It is entirely possible to trace coffee supply chains, despite their complexity. Other sectors such as cocoa are well on their way to doing so,"" said Julia Christian, a lawyer who works on forest campaigns for Fern.A BIG QUESTIONLavazza and Mondelez did not comment on specific solutions to their concerns.Some companies say the law in its current form could hamper Europe's food supply chain. ""I don't think that's what they're looking for,"" Van de Put said.He suggested better training for farmers to help them improve crop yields and avoid cutting down forest to plant more cocoa trees.Mondelez and members of a trade group working on the cocoa industry's forestry impacts met with the EU Commission on the law this spring, an executive said.By 2025, Mondelez is aiming to source all of its cocoa from farms in a programme that will have little to no deforestation.Italian confectionary group Ferrero wants the EU to provide specific guidance on compliance for each commodity because supply chains vary greatly between them.Although this guidance is still being hammered out, the maker of Nutella spread and Ferrero Rocher chocolates said it is well positioned overall to comply with the law.""To invent a traceability system in 1-1/2 years is very difficult. Luckily we have those foundations at Ferrero,"" said Francesco Tramontin, Ferrero's vice president of public policy and EU institutional affairs.The family-owned company said all the cocoa and palm oil it sources can be traced down to the individual farm or plantation level and segregated from raw materials that are not traceable.Deforestation is the second leading cause of climate change, after the burning of fossil fuels.Several top investors remain steadfast in their support of the regulation.""This legislation is an example of something that really is likely to affect companies that have not adequately prepared and can have financial consequences,"" said Snorre Gjerde, investment stewardship manager at Norway's sovereign wealth fund, NBIM.

The interconnection process currently takes an average of five years, up from less than two years in 2008 because the process was originally oriented toward a small number of fossil fuel-powered plants each year, instead of a large volume of renewable and storage projects.27 Jul 06:30 ET / 10:30 GMTVALERO ENERGY-RESULTS/Q2 2023 Valero Energy Corp Earnings ReleaseValero's quarterly profit are expected to decline compared to last year, but the company expects to see continues to see strong demand for refined products as summer travel ramps up.27 Jul 06:30 ET / 10:30 GMTBRISTOLMYERS-RESULTS/Bristol Myers reports second-quarter earningsBristol Myers Squibb Co will report its second-quarter earnings before markets open on Thursday.

468,8ae90c27-9701-3685-834a-3296feaa1e27,OXY,2023-07-27,Earnings Preview: Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-occidental-petroleum-oxy-140244447.html,1690380164,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -74.4%.Revenues are expected to be $6.95 billion, down 35.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.96% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Occidental?For Occidental, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.46%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Occidental will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of $1.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of -16.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Occidental doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.04%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil and gas producer would post earnings of $1.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.13, delivering a surprise of 9.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Hess , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, posted revenues of $2.32 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.64%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.99 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Hess shares have added about 3.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19%.What's Next for Hess?While Hess has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Hess: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.02 on $2.56 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.91 on $10.08 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States is currently in the bottom 18% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Occidental Petroleum (OXY), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.To calculate adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income and GAAP net income attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, which include amortization expense, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), investment portfolio gains and losses, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), certain litigation-related net charges (credits), EU MDR implementation costs, debt extinguishment charges, deferred tax expenses (benefits) and discrete tax items. Amounts are presented after-tax using the company's effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-270-30, ""General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate."" Please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that we file thereafter for an explanation of each of these adjustments and the reasons for excluding each item.The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share are GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and GAAP net income (loss) per common share - diluted, respectively.To calculate operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior periods. To calculate organic net sales growth rates, we also remove the impact of acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales is net sales on a GAAP basis.Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules.Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.We believe that presenting adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, adjusted net income (loss) per share, operational net sales growth rates and organic net sales growth rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results ""through the eyes"" of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-second-quarter-2023-301887271.htmlSOURCE Boston Scientific Corporation]"

The gradual improvement in the economic scenario compared to the first quarter implies that trading volumes have risen. This is expected to be reflected in the results of the industry players. Some major industry players like Boston Scientific BSX, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings or LabCorp LH and Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation IART are set to report their results tomorrow.Q2 Preview and ScorecardPer the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results so far have improved year over year despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in the form of worldwide inflationary pressure and unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Going by the broader Medical sector’s scorecard, 3.4% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 12.3% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jul 19. Of these, 100% beat earnings and revenue estimates. Earnings improved 9.3% year over year on 14% higher revenues.However, overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 18.6% despite 3.4% revenue growth. This compares with the first-quarter earnings decline of 17.9% on revenue growth of 4%.Factors That Influenced Medical Device StocksReplicating the broader market trend, Medical Device or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth in the second quarter is likely to have been significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Through the second-quarter months, the companies, which are into international trade, are expected to have faced severe currency headwinds. During this period, the U.S. dollar remained strong compared to several foreign currencies, which is expected to have had an unfavorable impact on sales.Further, in Medical Devices, going by the industry-wide trend, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs are likely to have weighed heavily on the corporate profitability of stocks across the board. This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter.Story continuesOn a positive note, companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses. During the post-pandemic phase, the key focus of medical device R&amp;D has again shifted from COVID-related PPE, testing and distant care options to point-of-care testing, heavy as well as minimally invasive implants, elective procedures and so forth. Accordingly, legacy base business recovery and testing demand through the months of the second quarter are expected to have been impressive. Meanwhile, AI and robotics for the medical Internet of Things (IoT), which rose to the limelight during the pandemic phase, remained popular.Medical Device Stocks to WatchLet's take a look at four defense companies that are scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 earnings on Jul 27 and find out how things might have shaped up prior to the announcements.Boston Scientific: An improved scenario in terms of hospital visits and elective medical procedures, along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, poise BSX well to register decent second-quarter 2023 results. Boston Scientific is particularly expected to have registered strong growth in EMEA within structural heart, including Transcatheter aortic valve replacement, WATCHMAN and other interventional cardiology therapies. It is also expected to have recorded growth in electrophysiology divisions, fueled by ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline and strong commercial execution.(Read more: Will Boston Scientific Beat Q2 Earnings Estimates?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.50 billion for the second quarter suggests a 7.8% improvement from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for BSX’s earnings of 49 cents per share indicates an 11.4% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is exactly the case as you can see below.BSX has an Earnings ESP of +0.47% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

However, a slowdown in COVID-19 testing is likely to have hampered the sales performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. This is expected to be reflected in its second-quarter results.(Read more: LabCorp to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LabCorp’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.99 billion, which implies a plunge of 19.3% from the year-ago figure.

Further, Integra’s Tissue Technologies business is expected to report strong second-quarter sales on efficient growth strategies and a better price management policy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Integra’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $373.9 million, which implies a 6% decline from the year-ago figure.

476,927291dd-782d-3ceb-909c-fc46531c21f4,COF,2023-07-27,"FOCUS-Coffee, candy makers question EU deforestation law",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-coffee-candy-makers-eu-102806575.html,1690453686,STORY,"['MDLZ', 'FC=F', 'LC=F', 'KC=F', 'CC=F']","[(Adds further comment from Ferrero in paragraphs 21 to 23)By Richa Naidu, Maytaal Angel and Jessica DiNapoliLONDON/NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Chocolate and coffee makers including Italy's Lavazza and Cadbury-maker Mondelez are concerned about the ""practicalities"" of a new European Union law aimed at stopping deforestation.The pushback comes despite voluntary, public commitments by the companies themselves and the broader coffee and cocoa industry to clean up supply chains using audits carried out by third parties like Fairtrade.Agreed in December, the law is expected to come into force at the end of 2024. Importers of coffee, cocoa, beef, soy, rubber and palm oil must prove their supply chains aren't contributing to the destruction of forests, a cause of climate change, or be fined up to 4% of their turnover in the bloc.Several major investors told Reuters last month that concerns about their exposure to the issue could lead them to quit consumer goods makers with ""risky"" supply chains.""It will be very difficult to implement this law in practical terms, because the coffee supply chain is very complex and traceability is very difficult,"" Lavazza Group Chairman Giuseppe Lavazza told Reuters. ""We are talking to the European authorities through our association to try to find a way.""The EU rules will be hard to implement without more guidance, Lavazza said, pointing to the large number of intermediaries involved in coffee.""These inherent characteristics of the coffee supply chain make traceability at the parcel level a huge challenge for the sector, as information on geolocation and contacts may not be available for small plantations,"" he added.Christophe Hansen, who led negotiations on the law for the European Parliament, said: ""I don't think it's impossible. It will be a challenge for them for sure because coffee sector producers are often quite small.Story continues""But we have integrated into the text (of the law) the obligation of the European Commission to help especially small-holder farmers to be able to comply with the requirements.""Oreo-maker Mondelez told Reuters it is ""not clear on how they (EU authorities) will control or implement this"" law.""There should be more dialogue about how do we practically make something happen on the ground,"" Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said in an interview with Reuters last month.The EU says it introduced its landmark deforestation law because years of voluntary commitments by food companies to rid their supply chains of environmental harms had largely failed to have an impact on the ground.Non-profit organisations including Earthsight, Fern and Solidaridad said the law mostly requires companies to put into action their voluntary pledges to stop sourcing from deforested areas.""It is entirely possible to trace coffee supply chains, despite their complexity. Other sectors such as cocoa are well on their way to doing so,"" said Julia Christian, a lawyer who works on forest campaigns for Fern.A BIG QUESTIONLavazza and Mondelez did not comment on specific solutions to their concerns.Some companies say the law in its current form could hamper Europe's food supply chain. ""I don't think that's what they're looking for,"" Van de Put said.He suggested better training for farmers to help them improve crop yields and avoid cutting down forest to plant more cocoa trees.Mondelez and members of a trade group working on the cocoa industry's forestry impacts met with the EU Commission on the law this spring, an executive said.By 2025, Mondelez is aiming to source all of its cocoa from farms in a programme that will have little to no deforestation.Italian confectionary group Ferrero wants the EU to provide specific guidance on compliance for each commodity because supply chains vary greatly between them.Although this guidance is still being hammered out, the maker of Nutella spread and Ferrero Rocher chocolates said it is well positioned overall to comply with the law.""To invent a traceability system in 1-1/2 years is very difficult. Luckily we have those foundations at Ferrero,"" said Francesco Tramontin, Ferrero's vice president of public policy and EU institutional affairs.The family-owned company said all the cocoa and palm oil it sources can be traced down to the individual farm or plantation level and segregated from raw materials that are not traceable.Deforestation is the second leading cause of climate change, after the burning of fossil fuels.Several top investors remain steadfast in their support of the regulation.""This legislation is an example of something that really is likely to affect companies that have not adequately prepared and can have financial consequences,"" said Snorre Gjerde, investment stewardship manager at Norway's sovereign wealth fund, NBIM.

480,453508a5-5006-3dc6-9ae5-a5a7f2f51d47,VRTX,2023-07-27,Earnings Preview: Repligen (RGEN) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-repligen-rgen-q2-140216234.html,1690380136,STORY,"['RGEN', 'VRTX']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Repligen (RGEN) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drug developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -46.2%.Revenues are expected to be $167.15 million, down 19.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.46% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Repligen?For Repligen, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.91%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Repligen will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Repligen would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of +8.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Repligen doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.85 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.41 billion, up 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Vertex has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.12%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vertex will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business performance, however, they should be used in conjunction with GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define similarly named measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. We utilize the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this release and have provided a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for each measure:Segment ProfitSegment profit is an important measure used by our chief operating decision maker for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. Beginning in 2023, we changed how we measure our manufacturing segment operating results to exclude the non-service components of pension and postretirement income, net; LIFO inventory provision; and intangible asset amortization. This measure also continues to exclude interest expense, net for Manufacturing group; certain corporate expenses; gains/losses on major business dispositions; and special charges. The prior period has been recast to conform to this presentation. The measurement for the Finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense.Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share and OutlookAdjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude special charges, net of tax and gains/losses on major business disposition, net of tax. We consider items recorded in special charges, such as enterprise-wide restructuring, certain asset impairment charges, and acquisition-related restructuring, integration and transaction costs, to be of a non-recurring nature that is not indicative of ongoing operations.Beginning in 2023, these measures also exclude LIFO inventory provision, net of tax and Intangible asset amortization, net of tax. LIFO inventory provision is excluded to improve comparability with other companies in our industry who have not elected to use the LIFO inventory costing method. Intangible asset amortization is excluded to improve comparability as the impact of such amortization can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions and exclusion of this expense is consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP measures provided by other companies within our industry. Management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. The prior period has been recast to conform to this presentation.Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJuly 1,July 2,July 1,July 2,2023202220232022Income from continuing operations - GAAP$263$218$454$411Add: LIFO inventory provision, net of tax26134522Intangible asset amortization, net of tax791519Adjusted income from continuing operations - Non-GAAP$296$240$514$452Earnings Per Share:Income from continuing operations - GAAP$1.30$1.00$2.22$1.88Add: LIFO inventory provision, net of tax0.130.060.220.10Intangible asset amortization, net of tax0.030.050.070.09Adjusted income from continuing operations - Non-GAAP$1.46$1.11$2.51$2.072023 OutlookDiluted EPSIncome from continuing operations - GAAP$927$947$4.59$4.69Add: LIFO inventory provision, net of tax960.48Intangible asset amortization, net of tax270.13Adjusted income from continuing operations - Non-GAAP$1,050—$1,070$5.20—$5.30TEXTRON INC.Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Outlook (Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Manufacturing Cash Flow Before Pension Contributions and OutlookManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions adjusts net cash from operating activities (GAAP) for the following:Deducts capital expenditures and includes proceeds from insurance recoveries and the sale of property, plant and equipment to arrive at the net capital investment required to support ongoing manufacturing operations;Excludes dividends received from Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and capital contributions to TFC provided under the Support Agreement and debt agreements as these cash flows are not representative of manufacturing operations;Adds back pension contributions as we consider our pension obligations to be debt-like liabilities. Additionally, these contributions can fluctuate significantly from period to period and we believe that they are not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations during the period.While we believe this measure provides a focus on cash generated from manufacturing operations, before pension contributions, and may be used as an additional relevant measure of liquidity, it does not necessarily provide the amount available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations that are not deducted from the measure.Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJuly 1,July 2,July 1,July 2,2023202220232022Net cash from operating activities - GAAP$314$364$467$589Less: Capital expenditures(83)(66)(145)(114)Add: Total pension contributions11112425Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment———18Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions - Non-GAAP$242$309$346$5182023 OutlookNet cash from operating activities - GAAP$1,275—$1,375Less: Capital expenditures(425)Add: Total pension contributions50Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions - Non-GAAP$900—$1,000View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230727988640/en/ContactsInvestor Contacts: Eric Salander – 401-457-2288Cameron Vollmuth – 401-457-2288Media Contact: Mike Maynard – 401-457-2362]"

QuinceyThanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a strong start to the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. Our combination of strong, loved brands and an aligned pervasive distribution system is allowing us to win in many different operating environments. Given our strong first half results and the resilience of our business, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today. To give you the full picture of our results and our raised guidance, I'll start by discussing second quarter performance and provide perspective on the current business and consumer environment. Then I'll highlight our performance across categories, including how we are driving quality leadership throughout our portfolio. Finally, I'll touch on why we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term objectives. And then John will end by discussing our results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, competing macro forces were at play across our markets. On the positive side, many supply chain pressures eased, concerns surrounding the stability of the banking sector diminished and energy prices continue to pull back from record highs. However, global inflation was still elevated, and geopolitical tensions continue to exist in some markets. Despite this confluence of factors, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth in this quarter. Volume was flat, and after a slower start, it sequentially improved with June being our strongest month in the quarter. In the first half of 2023, we delivered volume growth that was consistent with our underlying performance since 2019. More broadly, our industry is strong, and we believe we have significant headroom to grow both volume and value. And we continue to gain share. During the quarter, we gained value share in both at-home and away-from-home channels. As we look towards the second half, the global inflationary environment is impacting consumers and our business differently across geographies. In developed markets like North America and Western Europe, inflation is beginning to moderate, and labor markets remain strong. Our elasticities continue to be relatively low. However, we have seen some willingness to switch to private label brands in certain categories. Across the sector, consumers are increasingly cost-conscious. They're looking for value and stocking up on items on sale. In these markets, our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. It's more important than ever to be consumer-centric and to partner with customers to provide affordable and premium propositions, which deliver value through basket and incidence growth. In many developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, consumers are more accustomed to persistent inflation. However, the number of markets with intense inflation has expanded. Five of our top 40 markets are currently experiencing over 20% annual inflation. In these markets, it's equally important to leverage revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization to be able to take price with local market inflation, which helps offset the currency pressures. There are, as always, a few markets affected by specific local factors. In China, economic recovery slowed in the second quarter, and inflation has declined. Consumer confidence is below pre-pandemic levels. And we continue to monitor our leading consumer indicators and take action to win in the market. In India, business was unfavorably impacted by unseasonable rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter. However, the growth outlook remains intact. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs, our business is proving to be very resilient. We have many levers to pull to manage successfully through different operating environments. And we remain consumer-centric and focused on growth. Our recipe for success is unchanged. We continue to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world-class marketing and innovation, excellence in revenue growth management and strong execution. We are raising the bar and increasing quality leadership across our portfolio. Starting with Coca-Cola. We are growing our base of Gen Z drinkers, gaining share and leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies across our system. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share by linking Coca-Cola to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. A great example is a Recipe for Magic, which was activated in more than 50 markets and celebrates consuming Coca-Cola with meals. The campaign was supported by experiences using local chefs, leveraging approximately 750 influencers globally and was brought to life through social media and recipe-focused billboards. The Coke of Meals campaign also allowed Coca-Cola to strengthen its local relevance. For instance, in the away-from-home channel in Italy, Coca-Cola has grown incidence with pizza, the #1 consumed meal with approximately 3 billion pizzas each year from 10% to 20% over the past 4 years. While the Coca-Cola brand is ubiquitous, we tailor our price pack architecture to consumption occasions and are continuing to drive both affordability and premiumization. During the second quarter, we grew basket incidents and volume per trip by double digits while increasing price per liter. Moving on to sparkling flavors. We are seeing strong engagement from consumers across our staple of brands, which include Sprite, Fanta, FRESCA and Thums Up. At the same time, we have significant headroom to drive further quality leadership across developed and developing markets. With Sprite, we are driving brand awareness by connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experience at a more granular and locally relevant levels through our global Heat Happens platform. In North America, Sprite celebrated hiphop's 50th anniversary with the launch of Sprite Lymonade Legacy and sponsorship of concert tours, exclusive experiences and collaborations with prominent artists. We partnered with local pop stars and a Grammy producer in China using our Global Sprite Limelight Music Program for Gen Z drinkers across 1,500 college locations. In South Korea, the Sprite WaterBomb Festival similarly generated strong results. In India, the Joke in a Bottle promotion allowed consumers to scan packages and receive customized and localized jokes through WhatsApp to beat the heat. In June, Sprite was awarded most resilient brand by Kantar for adding the greatest number of new households in 2022 of any FMCG brand. Turning to water, sports, coffee and tea. We are segmenting the broader opportunities and using our refreshed resource allocation capabilities, prioritized markets and subcategories that offer the highest return on our investment. We are building our edge through consumer-centricity by accelerating the speed to market our innovation, measuring results in real time and scaling successes. We continue to build excitement for Fuze Tea through the rollout of green tea in Mexico, summer limited edition in Turkey and expansion of 0 sugar offerings across Europe. Early results show promising velocities and Fuze Tea grew volume double digits during the quarter. vitaminwater is another example. During the quarter, we relaunched vitaminwater zero in North America with a new sweetness system of monk fruit and stevia, which generated value share gains. We are capitalizing on consumer needs for rapid hydration, a fast-growing subsegment within sports drinks, with the launch of BODYARMOR FLASH I.V. in the U.S. and Flashlyte in Mexico. While still early, both saw strong consumer interest during the quarter and have demonstrated promising initial results. Our juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages have delivered 9 consecutive quarters of double-digit top line growth and gained both volume and value share during the quarter. We continue to innovate and drive premiumization under the Simply trademark. Simply mixology, which provides consumers with great tasting mixes and ready-to-drink mocktails, kicked off an experiential campaign that celebrated the start of the summer and its national rollout. Also, fairlife had another exceptional quarter as both Core Power and fairlife nutrition plan continued their strong momentum. In May, we announced a $650 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility to help drive the next wave of growth. Finally, we are encouraged by what we are seeing across alcohol ready-to-drink beverages. We continue to take a measured approach through exploring and applying our learnings. While still early, Jack and Coke has shown promising results. In the Philippines, the combination of Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou delivered strong share gains. The Schweppes Mojito rollout in India is also off to a good start. And these examples illustrate how our marketing transformation is coming to life. The strength of our total beverage portfolio gives us further confidence that we can continue to deliver by providing consumers beverage choices for every occasion. Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we remain committed to building a more sustainable future for our company and the planet as we strive to grow our business. We continue to pursue progress toward our vision of a circular economy for packaging through innovation and partnerships. For example, in the U.S., we recently partnered with Republic Services to ensure we have an adequate supply of recycled plastic for our packaging. At the same time, we are embracing refillables. We recently kicked off a program with customers in 4 U.S. cities to test refillable fountain cups with plans to expand elsewhere. We successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer-centricity to drive top line momentum; two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; and three, generating U.S. dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger, and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system and employees around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.John MurphyThank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the momentum of our business and our strong second quarter results. Starting with the top line. We grew organic revenues 11%. Unit cases were flat. As James said volume for the second quarter got off to a slower start but ended on a positive note. Concentrate sales were 1 point ahead of unit cases for the quarter primarily driven by the timing of concentrate shipments. Price/mix growth was 10% for the quarter driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year along with some new pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of hyperinflationary markets. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 40 basis points driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottle refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.78 was up 11% year-over-year despite a higher-than-expected 6% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $4 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment that was made during the second quarter as well as M&amp;A-related payments. Our balance sheet is strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.6x EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to invest to drive long-term growth. As James mentioned, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in the marketplace. While we continue to spin our strategic flywheel faster to generate top line-led growth, we have also progressed on our margin agenda as demonstrated by our consistent track record of offsetting cost headwinds to sustain steady gross margins. We have numerous levers available to drive top line growth and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend over the long term. Our all-weather strategy, coupled with the great plans that we have in place to continue to create quality leadership across our portfolio, give us good visibility to deliver on our raised 2023 guidance. This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% which includes positive volume growth while continuing to be led by price/mix. There are a few considerations to keep in mind. We expect pricing in developed markets to moderate through the year as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. In developing and emerging markets, we aim to take price with local market inflation. To the extent that intense inflation in markets drive elevated price/mix, the impact is oftentimes offset by currency as it is frequently difficult to hedge our exposure. Due to our reporting calendar, there will be 1 additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comfortable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 9% to 11%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are updating our currency outlook of an approximate 3- to 4-point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4- to 5-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Inflationary pressures are beginning to moderate in some ways, including freight rates that are favorable compared to last year. That said, several commodities that are prevalent in our baskets like sugar and juice remain elevated. And we have some hedges that we'll be rolling off to less favorable rates. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Our updated underlying effective tax rate for 2023 is now 19.3%. All in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments. If you exclude the transition tax payments made in the second quarter and various payments associated with M&amp;A transactions, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing U.S. income tax dispute with the IRS. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to build a culture that emphasizes raising the bar in every aspect of how we do business. Thanks to the tremendous ongoing commitment of our system employees around the world, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2023 and drive value for our stakeholders over the long term. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneI guess I have a question about just as we kind of look into the back half of the year and looking at organic sales, the implied organic sales guidance, which, I guess, is in the kind of the 5% to 6% range in the back half of the year. Maybe James and John, can you just talk a little bit about how maybe the -- just the macro environment or the operating conditions are today versus what you were thinking at the start of the year? And given that there's more of these markets where -- or countries where hyperinflation is an issue, is price a little bit more of a driver in terms of the organic sales comp in the back half of the year relative to volume again versus kind of what you were thinking at the start of the year?James Robert B. QuinceyYes. Well, let me try and unpack that a little bit. I think the headline part of the answer is there's a little more pricing in Q2 and in the downhill than we had expected at the beginning of the year, principally around that basket of countries where inflation is high, above 20% and a little more persistent. That's the short answer. The longer version of the answer is, look, we're executing the strategy we've talked about consistently over time and again, in CAGNY, the real focus on upping the bar on marketing, upping the bar on RGM, the commercial strategies and the execution of the marketplace. All with the intent about delivering a good, strong top line-led growth algorithms. And obviously that -- we've talked historically that in normal times, that 5% to 6% would be split between volume and price on a roughly equal basis. And so what you're seeing in the back half of the year, which I think is important to note, is we're expecting volume to be consistent in the second half with the way it was in the first half, which in the end is running our trend, if you like, a CAGR versus 2019, similar to what we did last year. So we see sustained positive volume growth coming out of '22. And we're looking for volume growth in the second half in a very similar way to the first half whether you're comparing to prior year or to 2019. So we want a business that is growing consumer base for all the right, appropriate strategic reasons. Then what's going to happen to revenue in the second half is we're going to see the impact of 3 buckets of price/mix. The first bucket is the carryover of pricing from prior year. Obviously, there was more cost inflation last year. But logically, that is a set of numbers that is going to tend to 0 by the end of December. And so that is going to step down as we go through Q3 and Q4. So bucket one, carryover. That's going to step down. Bucket two is price increases we've made so far this year that are leaving aside the large inflation countries, look much more like a normal year in terms of what we've taken this year, both in terms of timing, number of price increases and relative level of price increases. So we...(technical difficulty)OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stay on the line.James Robert B. QuinceyWhen did I stop? Operator, do you know when the line cuts on my answer?OperatorUnfortunately not, sir. Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.James Robert B. QuinceyOperator, let me just finish the other question. I was going to back up. Apologies to everyone for the technical trickiness. I'm just going to back up and if I'm repeating something I said apologies. And if there's a gap in the logic, apologies again. I think we talked about volume second half similar to first half, whether you talk in prior year or 2019. Pricing, 3 buckets. The bigger piece of the pricing of the 3 factors, which is the carryover, is obviously stepping down through the year towards 0 by the end of the fourth quarter. The new pricing that's come in, in '23 being very consistent with the kind of a normal level of pricing that we would see, and it's kind of in place already for the year. And that obviously then continues at the same rate through the rest of the second half. And the third piece, which is about 1/4 of what's happening on PMO at the moment, this bucket of higher inflationary countries and as I said earlier, there was a little more inflation from those countries in the second quarter than we had previously expected. Obviously, that then comes back around in a little more ForEx headwind. We are assuming that some of those inflation rates will moderate in the balance of the year in the second half and likewise moderate in the ForEx, although it's very uncertain. So we'll have to see what happens, but that's basically the composition of how to think about the effect of our strategy delivering good top line growth in the second half.OperatorOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanCan you hear me okay because like my line's got crackly now. That's okay. Great.James Robert B. QuinceyYes, we got you, Lauren.Lauren Rae LiebermanCool. Okay. I wanted to ask a little bit actually about Costa and coffee overall in light of the resource allocation model and identification of key profit pools and so on, not mentioned in the prepared remarks but definitely called out in the press release this morning with particular strength in the U.K. So I guess broad question would be how coffee overall is kind of fitting in on this thought process and resource allocation models if they are getting their particular differences by geography or is it for different emphasis on the category by different bottlers. And then specific to the numbers called out in the release and Costa U.K., should we think about that as recovery with mobility, COVID or tweaks or adjustments to the strategy you've made that are beginning to come through in performance?James Robert B. QuinceyYes. Sure, Lauren. Let me do it in reverse order. The Q2, I think, is more recovery than new stages of growth. Having said that, the Express machines have continued to expand numerically in terms of numbers of placements all the way through COVID and including so far this year. So the Express business, the B2B business, the U.K. is -- has been strong, remains strong and still growing, still gaining share. The retail -- the store numbers are much more about a recovery kind of completing the play on mobility perhaps and gain share a little bit. And obviously, we're focused on how to drive growth going forward, and we see plenty of headroom in the U.K. market. But I would characterize year-to-date more on -- more of a biased recovery on stores than new and the bias on Express on new. Internationally speaking, in -- if you just break it down into -- there's a couple of different buckets, the ready-to-drink bucket, we've made some good progress in China. We made some good progress in Japan with launches of ready-to-drink Costa in the case of Japan complementing Georgia. And actually Japan had a pretty good start to the year growing both Georgia and Costa. So kind of a full coffee strategy in the ready-to-drink looking good, and that's still the most important ready-to-drink coffee market for us. And then the B2B, which is a mix of Express along with kind of we're serving to providing machines and beans, starting to see that getting some traction in Europe with the bottling partners there and starting to kind of find its feet in the U.S., too. And those are the ones I've called out as the most -- as at the front of the program in terms of geographic expansion.OperatorOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.Dara Warren MohsenianSo I just wanted to follow up on Bryan's back half question. You did mention a weaker start in April post the Q1 call and then the stronger June volume performance, obviously, on this call. Is that engendering additional confidence internally around top line? And the reason I'm asking is it sounds like conceptually, you're not necessarily guiding to the June volume strength continuing in the second half. I'm just trying to understand that. Is that more just prudence, given the inflationary environment you mentioned and consumer volatility? Or are there other factors there? And as we think about your full year organic sales growth guidance range as part of that question, was that just the upside in Q2? Was some of it maybe some upside from Q1? Did you change expectations at all for the back half within that full year organic sales growth guidance raise?James Robert B. QuinceyI think Dara, you might get the price in those question in one question. Look, the -- clearly, in the second quarter, as we had anticipated in the previous call, April had started softly. But then things kind of normalized towards the end of the quarter, and June was a good solid month of growth. But I think the easier way to think about it is take the whole of the first half because you're always going to have some good months and some bad months. April happened to concentrate some price increases in developed countries and bad rains in India. Look, that will always happen on any given month. I think what is a question of what gives us confidence in the back half of the year by just saying January to June with its combination of good, middling and bad months, the growth rate in the first half, what we're expecting is a similar sort of growth rate in the second half, whether you compare to 2022 or to 2019. And so we think the momentum is there. We think in the developed markets, we've got through the pricing that needed to be taken in '23. We don't foresee substantive new pricing in the downhill. But we think this is going to be a well set up run through in the second half. And as I called out on that other answer with Bryan that the uncertainty factor is really around a concentrated in a few of these more inflationary marketplaces. Guidance going up, I guess there's obviously some flow through. We had a good first quarter, obviously, versus consensus. About a second quarter -- we clearly feel confident in our outlook for the full year, which is why we're taking it up. So there's some flow through. Obviously, there's some timing factors in the relative performance in Q2. And as we've talked on previous calls, given the nature of our business and where we sit in the supply chain relative to final sales, I think it's always good to take a multi-quarter average to the way of thinking about volume or pricing or even the flow-through to EPS. And I think that's kind of something that we always think about. Otherwise, you can get too distracted by the ups or downs on any given quarter. So we're going up. In the guidance, we feel confident about the second half. There'll always be some puts and takes, but we think we have a great strategy and a great plan to execute for the rest of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.Bonnie Lee HerzogAll right. I guess I had a question on your Asia Pacific operating margins, which were pressured again this quarter. And then, James, you touched on a couple of markets that are still facing pressures, but just hoping you could share a little bit more color on some of these headwinds in the region. And then any key initiatives you might have implemented to mitigate some of these pressures? And as a result, how should we think about your op margins trending through the remainder of the year in the region?James Robert B. QuinceySure. As it relates to Asia Pacific, what we -- there's obviously a set of things that happened in Q2 that were specific to Q2. There were some destocking in the China operating unit that was kind of a significant piece there. And there was some strong demand for some of the juice businesses in China and India. And those are 2 kind of atypical factors that happened that depressed on a timing basis the margin in Asia Pacific. It is worth noting that there is a sort of structural headwind when seen specifically just at the Asia Pacific region level. And what I mean by that is that we have a very big business in Japan, which is an excellent business and has a good operating margin. But then Asia Pacific concentrates a set of fast-growing emerging and developing markets, India, China, some of the Southeast Asian countries. And given the nature of how fast they grow and their emerging profile, i.e., they have price points that are lower than Japan, they create a negative geographic mix effect to the Asia Pacific reporting segment. And that's been a feature for an extended period of time. In other words, you have to sell 1-point-something cases in India and China to make up -- to kind of compensate the mix effect relative to Japan. So that kind of structural headwind is always slightly there. Obviously, our objective is through our strategies, our marketing, RGM execution and the way we invest to try and offset that headwind. So if you look back over time, you'll see that the -- whilst the margin fluctuates up and down, it has kind of had a certain stability when you look, for example, 2019 versus 2022. And so I close by saying don't over-rotate to 1 quarter in the case of Asia Pacific, given some of the issues. But I would also point out that this is not a region seen on its own where operating margin is likely to grow all the time because of the structural mix effect. But when seen at the company level, we obviously manage it as part of the overall portfolio so that it is a piece of the puzzle in looking at our total strategy of, as we've talked about, using the levers to hit that top end of the revenue 5 to 6 with a little bit of aggregate operating income margin expansion for the total enterprise. And we understand the role of each segment within that equation.OperatorOur next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersActually, I want to squeeze in 2 topics, but I want to pick up first on, James, what you were just talking about in the broader total company context. In the quarter, the top line was obviously strong. But I think relative to external expectations, we saw a bit more margin flow through and SG&amp;A leverage than was expected, especially in regions like North America, where the margin was exceptionally strong relative to history. So I'm curious in terms of how to think about the balance of managing top line growth versus continued margin expansion as you think about the back half. But then also more broadly, just in the context of your top line-led algo, is there maybe more cost efficiency opportunities that we should be thinking about longer term? Or is what we see in the quarter maybe more just a matter of timing? I also, John, if I could, I just want to loop back to a question I asked last quarter on below-the-line dynamics. You came into the year talking about below-the-line deleverage, interest expense and so on. We haven't seen that again this quarter, especially with the lower tax rate. So I'm just curious if that has changed in the full year and if that factored in to the full year guidance raise?John MurphySteve, let me take the second piece first. It's fairly straightforward. In the quarter, we benefited from higher equity income and from interest that we earned on our overseas cash, which was in both cases ahead of what we had soon when we guided at the start of the year. And from the second half of the year, I don't expect either of those 2 to be as strong. So I do think we'll have a little bit of deleverage in the second half of the year but modest, not a significant variable for your consideration in the second half of the year.James Robert B. QuinceyYes. Back to the margin element of the question. North America, in a way, is a fluid side of what we just talked about in Asia Pacific. Obviously, the results came in very strong in North America on the top line and on the margin. Again, there are a number of timing factors that kind of flatter the second quarter margin structure in the case of North America, including, for example, the -- a bit like the Costa U.K. bit as it was a much faster growth rate in the away-from-home than the at-home in the North American marketplace. And obviously, that's margin accretive. That should be seen as, in a way, more completing the play of the recovery versus COVID. So the completion of the reopening of restaurants, cafes, theme parks, et cetera, et cetera. And so that channel mix, if you like, flatters the operating income in the short term. There's a number of timings of other things that impact that, BODYARMOR integration, et cetera. I think the way to think about margin going forward by segment and most importantly for the company overall is, firstly, not to over-rotate on any 1 quarter. Remember that there are a number of expense items and deduction items that we accrue on the basis of sales curve, not just what actually happened in the quarter. So timing is a feature. And that's why I'm very strong on let's take 4 quarters in a row and look at that relative to history. And when you do that, whether in North America or Asia Pacific or more importantly, the company in the overall, what you're going to see is us sticking to our strategy, which is to drive the growth from the top line and then to look for modest or moderate increments of the operating margin, which we deliver not just by effective strategies to allocate resources, whether they be marketing or operating expenses so that we are efficient and get a little bit of leverage there. But the design of the portfolio itself and the RGM strategies also is a component in creating sales that inherently have a little more gross margin. So we use all the levers to try and deliver. And so don't take these segments over or under deliveries as a sign of something new and radical happening. If they are features of our business model and the big overall idea is top line growth with small income and operating margin expansion.OperatorOur next question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.Robert Edward OttensteinJames, I'd like to talk about the global system. Recently, there's been a lot of interesting developments from some of the bottlers. You had CCH buy Finlandia. You've had a lot of your bottlers, particularly in Latin America and elsewhere, talk about B2B platforms that they're developing. And so my question is, how are you thinking about these developments? Are there new models, revenue, earnings sharing models? And how do you make sure that the bottlers stay focused on those products that drive the most value for The Coca-Cola Company?James Robert B. QuinceySure. Let me start just by headlining actually, we've just come off. Last week, we had a Global Bottler Meeting in Atlanta. I think it's in 30-plus years since we had that meeting in Atlanta, but we had it in Atlanta last week with the majority of the biggest bottlers in the Coke system. And I think it was a very clear meeting on our collective will and ability and interest in investing in this business and our overall level of alignment on what's important and what should we drive individually and what needs to be driven collectively. So actually, you guys all go around and talk to the bottlers as well, and I think you will get it reflected back from them that there is a very high degree, not just an alignment on what needs to be done, but enthusiasm on the opportunities ahead of us to drive the business, our collective business forward. On some of the specifics, clearly, you've got in that basket, there are things that happen around the world that are local and a biased set of dynamics that are important and relevant and not necessarily projectable around the world. And the case of CCH and the distribution, now the ownership of Finlandia, I think, is one of those. The B2B platforms, which are progressed very nicely in Latin America, are a feature of the business in multiple other countries. We've been testing and exploring and developing individually and collectively B2B platforms with the principal objective of enhancing the system and most importantly, the bottlers' relationships with the retailers. To the extent that we can compliment, and here we're largely talking the fragmented channel because the relationship with the modern trade is already set on electronic platforms anyway. We're talking about the fragmented trade, and the majority of the almost 30 million customers we visit as a system is to enhance that relationship, to make it no longer a hostage to the visit of the Coke sales rep but to make it a 24/7 opportunity to enhance relationship, to order product, to ask for a service call, to get a new cooler, to put some umbrellas up or to add to an order that's already about to delivered. And that is certainly when we have evaluated how those customers where the B2B platforms are available how they're doing versus where it's not yet rolled out. There's clearly an improvement, not just in the relationship however you want to measure it, but also in the sales. So there's a lot going on in the system. And I think the last thought there is you should take it also as examples of the willingness of the system to experiment and try and be on the front edge of what drives value in the marketplace.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareyYou made a comment on some private label switching happening in certain markets. Can you just expand on where you're seeing this specifically geographically and perhaps by category and the playbook that you'll be deploying in these markets, the sorts of developments that you'd be looking for to respond to these actions ahead? And I asked that a bit in the context of, clearly, some of your ingredients are still quite inflationary and whether you see any potential risk to being able to price against that inflation in some of these markets going forward. Obviously, you have a playbook with a lot of different levers. And I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on where these developments seem to be happening and how do you think about responding to these a bit more specifically.James Robert B. QuinceySure. So private label switching is principally a feature firstly in Europe, and then to some extent also in the U.S. If you were to include price brands or B brands, you might see some of that also in Latin America depending on how you want to define it. But very specifically on private label, that's number one, a European effect; and number two, a U.S. effect. And it's, in our view, highly related to the strength of the brands in any specific category. So we see it more in terms of beverages, happening in water and juices rather than soft drinks and certainly less when you get to colas. The strategy on top of what we need to do in terms of marketing and continuing to make the brands relevant to consumers and executing in the marketplace is, of course, the RGM strategy. Yes, premiumization remains an opportunity, but we need to keep an anchor and continue to evolve and adapt our strategies on affordability, whether that be refillables, whether it be affordable small packs or affordable featuring consumption packs, that has become something that is a tested strategy in inflationary environments, well learned in Latin America, for example, but now applied, has been for a number of years in Europe and in the U.S. And we have more things we can do in both marketplaces to have an anchor in both affordability and premiumization. And that's a playbook that we're rolling out and executing in those marketplaces. As it relates to the inflation and the COGS coming through, obviously, some of that, whether it be juice or sugar and corn syrup, affects different markets. The most of the inflation is in a set of markets where we do price for local inflation. And in a way, the higher inflation gets, the more likely it is we're just -- you're going to follow inflation. And so the risk not following is not really there as it goes up. The risk actually appears on the volume side. But this is a select group of markets. So if it were to err towards the more inflation in the back half of the year, we think it's manageable. If we were to err for the less inflation, that would be good, but we think it's in a bucket of manageable things. And as it relates to the total company relative to some of those input costs, we have very long-term relationships with most providers and long-term hedging programs, which allow us to kind of -- they don't avoid inflation, but they smooth it that they make it much more manageable from a pricing and packaging point of view.OperatorOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi.Filippo FalorniCan you guys talk a bit more about your alcohol strategy broadly, particularly with the Red Tree Beverages subsidiary? And specifically in terms of like new innovation, any other subcategories or areas where you're looking to expand within alcohol? I know you're experimenting, but just any color on the future plans will be great.James Robert B. QuinceyYes. Thanks, Filippo. Look, the Red Tree entity that we stood up in the second quarter is more of a technicality than some new big step. It isn't a change in strategy, and it's not a vehicle to distribute in the U.S. It allows us a better platform to engage with the partners that we're working with in the U.S. in terms of coordinating and influencing the marketing and allows us a better separation of the alcohol versus the non-alcohol band. So it's more an optimization of the model and how we want to execute things rather than a different thing. And then in terms of progress, look, it's still a small part of the business. And as I talked about, I think it was CAGNY, that's great, and there are lots of runs on the board. Jack and Coke has got some really promising nice results, including in the U.S. Simply Spiked Peach is performing very nicely in the U.S. If you want to look for a really bright spot, you can hedge the Philippines and Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou, which is an alcoholic lemon drink, got well over 30% share of the RTD category. All of this is very encouraging as we continue to take a measured approach to this and to kind of learn and apply our learnings. All of this needs to generate belief that it can be material for the Coke company, not just a nice business, and that we're still in the process of driving towards. But certainly, so far, we're pleased with what's taken place, and we are encouraged about the next steps that we have to take.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraAnd James, on your volumes commentary, and I appreciate that on your 4-year CAGR, I think if our math is correct, it's 1.7% unit case for total company, which is obviously remarkable. That said, I think EMEA was a bit softer in the quarter. I understand your commentary about Russia. And what is actually happening in EMEA ex Russia? And how we should be thinking going forward? And related to that, since you commented that the U.S. was very strong out of home, and Europe is -- a big percentage of Europe is out of home, on the comments about June, how we should be thinking not only about Europe, but the performance of on-premise against off-premise globally?James Robert B. QuinceyI'm trying to process all the questions. I think you've beaten, that was Dara. I think you've beaten Dara. EMEA was a bit softer. Yes. I think on EMEA, we are -- it was even though -- so on EMEA, we're expecting EMEA to be positive in the second half. And so there was a ramp effect from the withdrawal from Russia in the second quarter. But we -- so Europe was in pretty good shape, actually, Europe ex Russia. If you take the first half, Europe ex Russia was positive. So we are feeling that now it's dropped out of the base numbers in the second half that actually Europe and EMEA will be in good shape. Obviously, EMEA has got a couple of the hyperinflationary countries like Turkey, like Pakistan, so EMEA could get other effects. But if you concentrate where Russia is, which is Europe, which is the biggest impact, actually, Europe had a positive volume in the first half if you take out Russia. And so we're feeling good about Europe as we go into the second half. And I think the question really is the trade-off between pricing and volume in a couple of countries, particularly Turkey and Pakistan and for those that want to go deep down the rabbit hole, Zimbabwe as well. Now the next part of the question, which was about our away-from-home versus at-home. Yes. It wasn't just June, which was the strength in the U.S. basically the first half. You've seen the out-of-home growing ahead of the at-home and the recovery. And I think that's the way to think about it is we're seeing the back end of the recovery in the away-from-home. Similarly, in Europe, in fact, globally, transactions were ahead of volume, which tends to imply smaller packages are growing faster than bigger packages from a mathematical point of view. So as a global feature, there's a little more on-premise consumption or a little more small package consumption than large package consumption, which helps as well. But I don't -- we should see this as a new secular trend, more the kind of the last bit of renormalization post-COVID.OperatorOur final question today will come from Peter Grom from UBS.Peter K. GromSo James, maybe just 2 quick follow-ups. One, just on Chris' question around trade down and improving affordability. Do you expect any changes in the promotional environment, particularly in North America? It doesn't sound like that's a shift you expect, but just wanted to be sure. And then just following up on your response to Andrea's question, I would be curious how you see channel mix evolving as consumers seek more value in some of these developed markets, particularly just given the strength from away-from-home that you just alluded to?James Robert B. QuinceyWe see the U.S. pricing and promotional environment as pretty rational. We have a set of strategies in place to try and balance our premiumization, regular and affordability strategies in the U.S., which includes a little more promotion than the first quarter. But basically, promo levels are very similar to prior years and not as a step up. And we think that we have the right balance of premiumization and affordability plays to be able to continue to gain as we did in the second quarter volume and value share in the U.S. So we think the environment is rational. We think our strategy works for us because we gain volume and value share. And we've got the right mix of -- roughly the right mix of promo and price. And obviously, we're going to continue to push the affordability and the premiumization play. And then the channel mix question, do we think we'll see in developing markets what -- I think the principal feature is a renormalization post-COVID. I don't think it's kind of recessionary or inflationary or that. I think it's just been -- we've kind of seen a renormalization of the channel mix. We had talked over prior years about how big an impact on price mix and margin structure, the shift in channels were with what seems ages ago, the lockdowns. That has now largely played out, which is another way of saying, we don't expect channel mix to be a major feature of the discussion in quarters and years to come.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.James Robert B. QuinceyYes. Thank you, operator. So just to quickly summarize. Second quarter results, I think, demonstrate the momentum we have in the marketplace. We are navigating a broad set of dynamics in the local markets while driving scale and maintaining flexibility at a global level. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our '23 guidance and our longer-term objectives. Thanks for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

The Federal Reserve raised its fed funds rate range to 5.25%-5.50%, the highest level since March 2001. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says inflation needs to cool more before the rate hiking cycle can come to a complete end. The Yahoo Finance Live team shares their biggest takeaways from the interest rate decision and Powell's news conference.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: Fed raising rates by another 25 basis points today, pushing interest rates to the highest levels that we've seen in 22 years. Here with more on what we just heard from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Alexandra Canal, Josh Schafer here, joining the roundtable discussion. And guys, there's lots to dig into what we just heard from Powell.But I want to start with some of the comments that we heard about the labor market, where things stand right now. We know the tight labor market has been an issue for the Fed and its fight against inflation, its fight to cool inflation. Let's take a listen to what Powell had to say.JEROME POWELL: I don't think we're targeting wage inflation. I think what we're looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions. And that's what we're seeing. So wages have actually been gradually moving down. They're still at levels what that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2% inflation. Nonetheless, we're making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling.SEANA SMITH: labor market demand cooling. You're talking about the fact that the supply and demand balance getting better into balance at this point. But wages, Josh, has been such a massive issue here for the Fed. And he kind of downplayed maybe some of the risks there. We just heard from Brent Tschudy earlier in the hour. And he called this kind of the last frontier when it comes to the Fed's fight against inflation and some of the weakness that we would need to see in order for the Fed to get to their target.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: It's an interesting part, right, because it's the part that you haven't really seen play out yet. They talked-- Chair Powell also talked a lot about the fact that we've already seen a lot of why inflation has come down, hasn't necessarily been all because of the policy, right? You've had inflation come down for a number of reasons.And now you're at the point where you do need people to probably have less money and be willing to pay that extra amount, that little 1%, that last mile that we've talked a lot about. And I think this is where you really do need to see the labor market slow down. And so he's kind of projecting in the future almost because you look at where things have gone right now and he pointed to it at 1.2. I mean, the labor market is relatively healthy.The unemployment, it's tight, but you could say it's healthy to, right? The unemployment rate flat since they started this process over a year ago. But are you going to be able to get inflation all the way down without that unemployment rate ticking up. He sort of hinted at probably not. That's just not historically how it's worked. I think the question is how much.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I was just going to say on that, historically, it's not how it's worked. We're also coming out of a pandemic. So it's a very different environment than we've been at before. So I do wonder if that changes the caliber of what the Fed needs to do moving forward.I mean, Jerome Powell did say that it's a, quote, ""real blessing"" that we've had a disinflationary environment while the labor market continues to outperform. But I just wonder, in this post-COVID economy, if the rules of the game are just different.- Well, I mean, this is really where the divisions lie within the FOMC. And we were talking about this earlier in the show, but it is about how much of that additional 1%, the 2%-- depending on which metric we're looking at in terms of inflation-- how much of that will be in the Fed's control. And to your point, Ali, if you think about where inflation has gone, a year ago, we were at 9%, roughly 9%. So much of that was because of what happened during the pandemic-- the supply chain snags, having the shortages.A lot of that has eased already. And then it becomes, well, to what extent can monetary policy get you to that last mile, to that 2%? The Fed Chair doesn't want to be seen as saying, well, we want people to lose jobs. That's not the messaging he wants. But at the same time, the very quote that Brent Schutte talked about, which is that at the end of the day, we want wages to go up with a pace that is consistent with the 2% target. And that, I think, is key. Yes, we want wages to be stable.- Because that's more than how much they are increasing right now, right?- Exactly.- That's why. It's key.- Yeah, and is that actually right? And is that going to come, I think, is sort of the interesting piece of that. But I thought it was also interesting, too. He kind of got thrown the, it's looking more like that soft landing might happen, a couple of times. He could have maybe taken a little bit of a victory lap when it comes to that, or at least said, things are looking better. And he never really bit on that.I thought at least multiple questions left that open for him to say, you know, yeah, things do probably look a little bit better than they looked a month ago or two months ago. And he said, well, been in the same camp the whole time. But I thought that was an interesting part of it as well.- But the risk is about re-acceleration of inflation, right? And that's really key. That's why we heard him say over and over that it's been restrictive, but it's not been restricting long enough. Now, if you're in the market and you're listening to it, that doesn't really answer the question of, does that require another rate hike, or does it mean that we're going to remain at this level for much longer?- And I think that really also points to the fact as to why Wall Street is so split on this. We heard from a number of on the buy side, on the sell side coming into this, coming into this press conference, into this Fed decision, that there's a lot of uncertainty about what the Fed is going to do from here on out until the end of the year and whether or not another hike is warranted. And I haven't taken a look at the CME Fed Fund Futures after this decision. All right, so [INAUDIBLE].- It's basically flat.- Basically flat.- And I think basically what the market is, too, right? Even stocks today.- So then, I think--- Stocks are back to where they were before the meeting.- And so then, I think that you can argue the fact that Jerome Powell did exactly what he intended to do and wanted to do in today's press conference. The lack of reaction that we saw in the market, the lack of, really, any difference that we're seeing in terms of the projections coming from investors, I think that means he walked that fine line. He did it well. He was still saying-- and he said it a million times-- that the Fed is leaving its door open. It's going to be [INAUDIBLE].- He put all options on the table.- All options on the table.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Maybe it's the summer of choice, right? Are you gonna see ""Barbie"" or ""Oppenheimer""? Are you gonna hike, or you're not gonna hike?- I loved that. He got the ""Barbie"" question.- Of course, that was amazing.- I thought Morgan Stanley put it really well. They said, why rock the boat? When you have it priced at 99% that you're going to hike, you do the hike, right? You talk about the fact that the economy is strong. He took a couple of nice jabs there about things going well, pointed out everything that's obvious, everything that's data-dependent that you've seen, and then said, ah, we'll see in September. We haven't really decided anything-- and sort of said basically nothing.He moved the market up a little bit. Stocks were up for a little bit. And then, he reminded everyone that we're not going to get to 2% inflation until 2025, and stocks went right back to where they were. And I think just that's the overall takeaway for me here, is you still have about a 30% chance that we get another hike by November per the CME FedWatch tool. It was a little bit over 30% 24 hours ago. Again, stocks basically not moved since the meeting started.- And I think to see more inflation reports, that's going to be key. Because he said, you know, it was just one reading, right? The June report that we got that came in positive, he welcomes the good news. And many forecasts are calling for inflation to stay low, but he said that is hard to just go off the forecast. They need to see the data, and that's going to be key, whether or not the Fed decides to hike in September.- It's a good use of time, right? You have until September, you have the multiple more inflation reports, and you have two more jobs reports. Why comment too much on one report and make too much out of it if you really don't have to?- Yeah, and that's the Fed Chair's way of just keeping the door open on both directions.- And he did. And we've got eight weeks to now discuss what exactly we think the Fed is going to do next.- All right.- Ali, thanks so much-- and, of course, Josh as well.]"

(CSTL) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-castle-biosciences-inc-140201248.html,1690380121,STORY,"['CSTL', 'INCY']","[The market expects Castle Biosciences, Inc. (CSTL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1583.3%.Revenues are expected to be $43.51 million, up 24.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Castle Biosciences, Inc.For Castle Biosciences, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Castle Biosciences, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Castle Biosciences, Inc. Would post a loss of $0.80 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.10, delivering a surprise of -37.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis specialty drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.9%.Revenues are expected to be $927.53 million, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.74% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Incyte?For Incyte, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -20.86%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Incyte will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Incyte would post earnings of $0.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.37, delivering a surprise of -56.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

Although numbers were down year over year due to difficult comparison, most firms’ results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top and the bottom line. The sector has been banking on improving demand for housing and remodelling activities and solid growth in the infrastructural and public construction spending.The rising demand for non-residential and infrastructural activities for public project work are expected to have supported growth. Other factors like favorable weather, prudent cost-saving efforts, a disciplined approach to bidding, project management, strength in funding programs across the states and rapid fiber deployments are added positives.

Homebuilders are opting to downsize in order to attract more entry-level homebuyers. Yahoo Finance Reporter Dani Romero details the pricing pressures Millennial-aged consumers are facing in the housing market while new home sales trend lower.Video TranscriptJARED BLIKRE: Homebuilders are downsizing the American dream to lure in entry level buyers who are frustrated by resale housing market. Yahoo Finance's, Dani Romero, joins us with more. Dani, the details, please.DANI ROMERO: Jared it's all about meeting affordability. So the size of a home correlates to interest rates. With mortgage rates hovering over 6%, the game here is the more that you can afford the size of your home gets bigger, the less you can fork up the size of your home gets smaller. What is the current size of a new single family home right now? Data from the Census Bureau shows that the average square footage of a new home stood at 2469 square feet, you can see that on your screen right now, in the first quarter of this year. That's down 2% from the previous 6 quarter which stood at 2525 square feet. The difference is 56 square feet. That is-- that equals to a nice size bathroom.But a smaller home isn't killing buyer appetite. First time homebuyers are responding. PulteGroup said in their second quarter earnings call on Tuesday that first time home buyers remain financially resilient and they're also dipping into their personal savings to go towards their down payment, and millennials are also asking for support from their parents. But you know what's interesting here, Jared, is the fact that even though there is a-- homes are shrinking in size, the size of your kitchen is actually going to get bigger or will continue to get bigger. That depends, obviously, on the buyer itself. But it also shows that people are probably enjoy being in the kitchen.JARED BLIKRE: Sounds like that might be a development that came post-pandemic or kind of created that vibe there. We did get some disappointing today on the news-- new home sales front breaking a three month up streak. So prices actually lowering for these new units coming online here.Story continuesDANI ROMERO: Jared, overall sales pace looks positive, buyer demand is strong. The lack of the resale market will help boost the new homes market. And there's also a growing pipeline of new homes that are going to be going on to the market. So we also heard from CFO of Whirlpool, Jim Peters, talk about that this is really a bright spot. Take a listen.[VIDEO PLAYBACK]I think then as you look to next year we would expect to begin to see-- as interest rates stabilize and it's kind of been absorbed and normalized within the marketplace, you'll begin to see some of those existing home sales pick up. But, you know, right now I'd say new home construction will be the first thing to show signs of growth.[END PLAYBACK]DANI ROMERO: And you heard it right, there the enthusiasm in new home construction and also in the new home market is really going to continue, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Well, if any-- if the share price is any indication those homebuilders have been absolutely flying this year. Dani Romero, thank you for that report.]"
504,5574ad92-82d8-3573-a1da-0f8fd041c923,IR,2023-07-27,Trane Technologies (TT) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trane-technologies-tt-reports-next-140219474.html,1690380139,STORY,['TT'],"[The market expects Trane Technologies (TT) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.1%.Revenues are expected to be $4.62 billion, up 10.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.06% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Trane Technologies?For Trane Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Trane Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Trane Technologies would post earnings of $1.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.41, delivering a surprise of +6.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Trane Technologies appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for LyondellBasell Industries:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.5b ÷ (US$36b - US$6.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, LyondellBasell Industries has an ROCE of 15%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Chemicals industry. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries roceIn the above chart we have measured LyondellBasell Industries' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for LyondellBasell Industries.What Can We Tell From LyondellBasell Industries' ROCE Trend?When we looked at the ROCE trend at LyondellBasell Industries, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 26% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by LyondellBasell Industries' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 14% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries   you'll probably want to know about.While LyondellBasell Industries isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip the details, head straight to the 8 Most Famous Bridges in the US. The United States is home to numerous iconic bridges that have made the country's traffic flow better. Among the most famous bridges in the US, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is a symbol of innovation and resilience. Besides boasting an overpowering design, the bridge also works as a transportation link between San Francisco and Marin County. Similarly, the Brooklyn Bridge, completed in 1883, was the world's first steel-wire suspension bridge that facilitated transport between Manhattan and Brooklyn when there were limited commute means. Besides being direct commute routes, these structures often carry utilities like water pipes and power lines, contributing to the country's infrastructure backbone. In urban settings, bridges help mitigate traffic congestion by working as alternative routes or layering traffic vertically.We have recently covered 25 Most Famous Bridges In The World; explore these structural marvels to expand your knowledge of the architecture around you.Overview of The United States' Bridge and Road Infrastructure Critical infrastructure like the road network and bridges is fundamental for the United States as they contribute to economic progress. The bridge industry is a subset of the broader infrastructure sector and has been an integral element in shaping the dynamics of the transportation system. Bridge construction in the US is characterized by over 600,000 bridges that elevate the economy's connectedness and mobility. The US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has estimated that over 4 billion vehicles cross US bridges daily, signifying their crucial role in facilitating the seamless movement of goods, services, and people.Story continuesBesides serving as fundamental links for commuting, bridges act as catalysts for economic activity by reducing travel time and distance, eventually enhancing logistics and supply chain efficiency. For instance, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Brooklyn Bridge in New York are iconic structures that uplift local economies through tourism and make commuting in these densely populated areas easier. However, the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2021 Infrastructure Report Card rated the nation's bridges at a ""C,"" as 42% of these bridges are at least 50 years old. The bridges being more than 50 years old mean they are structurally deficient and need repair. The same report suggested that an estimated $125 billion is required to rehabilitate and preserve the existing inventory of bridges. As of current, the country's spending on bridge rehabilitation is $14.4 billion, which is mostly spent on surface repairs. However, in light of a detailed structural analysis, ASCE suggests that the country's budget should be $22.7 billion annually to manage bridges. Although around 37 states have increased their gas tax in the past decade, the need to uphold these old structures requires more effort. As the most famous bridges in the US age, the country's focus is on maintaining their integrity instead of adding more bridges to the network. In this aspect, companies like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM), and Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) are some of the biggest names. For instance, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) supplies crushed stone, sand, and gravel used in construction applications, including the maintenance of roads and bridges. Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) also produces asphalt and ready-mixed concrete used in infrastructure projects like bridges, overpasses, and roadways.Likewise, Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) is the United States' largest producer of construction aggregates, i.e., crushed stone, sand, and gravel. These aggregates form a significant component of construction materials used for building and maintaining infrastructure, including roads and bridges. Also, Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) produces materials for roadway construction and maintenance of paving highways, parking lots, and airport runways.  If we talk about the equipment used in road and bridge upkeep, Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) is unrivaled. Being the largest manufacturer of construction equipment, Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) is often directly or indirectly involved in ensuring these crucial structures' safety. Furthermore, the Biden administration's $1 trillion infrastructure investment plan, passed in 2021, also depicts the importance of the infrastructure industry. Out of the announced $1 trillion, $110 billion will be spent on road and bridge betterment and $66 billion for freight and passenger rail, among other projects. Which Is The Longest Bridge In The USA?Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, in Louisiana, is the longest bridge in the USA. It is a twin-span bridge consisting of two parallel structures, and its total length is approximately 23.83 miles (almost 38350 meters). Its parallel bridge configuration was adopted to facilitate better traffic flow and to allow for routine maintenance without significant disruption to commuters. The Causeway is operated by the Greater New Orleans Expressway Commission (also called the Causeway Commission), a body that was created by the Louisiana Legislature in 1952. Let's now move toward the 25 most famous bridges in the United States.25 Most Famous Bridges In The US25 Most Famous Bridges In The USOur Methodology We selected the 25 most famous bridges in the US according to their significance in history and traffic management. We believe that a structural entity's history determines its fame, and that's why we ranked the most popular US bridges according to the time they were opened for public use in ascending order of fame.So, here are the most popular bridges in the US:25. Mario Cuomo Bridge (Replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge), NY - 2017The Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that replaced the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River in New York.

Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, St. Louis, MO - 2014The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge is also a cable bridge across the Mississippi River between St. Clair County, Illinois, and St. Louis, Missouri. The bridge was named after Stan Musial, a baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals who was widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport and in honor of the service of all veterans.23. Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, NV/AZ - 2010The Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge is a steel and concrete arch bridge in the United States that spans the Colorado River between Arizona and Nevada. The structure was completed in 2010 and is located within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and its construction was part of the Hoover Dam Bypass project.

Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, Charleston, SC - 2005The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge was opened in 2005 to connect Charleston and Mount Pleasant in South Carolina. The bridge stands over the Cooper River, and its 471-meter-long main span is the third longest among cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. The bridge, which has a total length of 4000 meters, was built to replace the structurally deficient Grace Memorial Bridge and Silas N. Pearman Bridge.21. Sidney Lanier Bridge, Brunswick, GA - 2003The Sidney Lanier Bridge spans the Brunswick River in Georgia. At 148 meters in height, it is the tallest bridge in the state, and its main span is 381 meters long. The bridge was constructed to replace an older, unsafe vertical-lift bridge and resolved critical transportation issues by allowing larger vessels to navigate the shipping channel below with fewer restrictions.20. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge, Boston, MA - 2003The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge is a part of Boston's Big Dig project, one of the most extensive highway projects in the US. The cable-stayed bridge has a total length of 4,366 meters and a maximum height of 82 meters. It pays tribute to Boston's historical role in the American Revolution with its design inspired by the Bunker Hill Monument.19. Al Zampa Memorial Bridge, Vallejo, CA - 2003The Al Zampa Memorial Bridge, officially opened in 2003, is a vital suspension bridge in Vallejo, California. The structure is named in honor of ironworker Al Zampa who worked on several of the area's notable bridges and spanned 1,056 meters across the Carquinez Strait. Its inauguration resolved traffic congestion issues significantly on the old Carquinez Bridge. It is also the only bridge in the country that is named after a blue-collar worker, aimed to regard the workers' contribution to CA's infrastructure. 18. Sunshine Skyway Bridge, St. Petersburg, FL - 1987The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in the US. It has been gracing the horizon of St. Petersburg, Florida, since 1987. It's renowned for its distinctive yellow cables that make it a recognizable symbol of the region, and has a total length of 6,663 meters and a height of 131 meters. The bridge directly routes Tampa Bay and minimizes the distance between St. Petersburg and Terra Ceia.17. New River Gorge Bridge, Fayetteville, WV - 1977 The New River Gorge Bridge WAS completed in 1977 in the Appalachian Mountains of Fayetteville, West Virginia. The engineering feat stands 267 meters above the New River and has a total length of 924 meters. The completion of the bridge reduced a 40-minute drive down narrow mountain roads to a mere minute. It also holds the distinction of being one of the highest vehicular bridges in the world.16. Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, New York, NY - 1964The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in America. It spans the Narrows Strait in New York. At its opening in 1964, it was the world's longest suspension bridge, with a main span of 1,298 meters. It is named after explorer Giovanni da Verrazano and provides a critical link between Staten Island and Brooklyn. However, its construction displaced numerous residents and raised issues about the social impacts of infrastructure development.15. Mackinac Bridge, Mackinaw City, MI - 1957The Mackinac Bridge, often called ""Mighty Mac,"" is an iconic symbol of Michigan's unity that links Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas. The bridge boasts a length of approximately 8,038 meters and a maximum height of 168 meters. The five-mile-long bridge was opened in 1957 over the Straits of Mackinac to offer a year-round connection that previously relied on winter ice bridges or ferries. Despite its utility, it is known for high winds that occasionally necessitate escorts for drivers.14. Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Metairie, LA - 1956 &amp; 1969The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Metairie, LA, holds a Guinness World Record for the longest bridge over water (continuous), at 38,442 meters. It consists of two parallel bridges, built in 1956 and 1969, which reduced travel time around the lake and spurred economic growth in the region. However, it has been a focal point of discussions about sustainability and environmental impact due to concerns about coastal erosion.13. Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Annapolis, MD - 1952The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, formally known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, opened up to public in 1952. It is a key architectural marvel in Annapolis, Maryland, with a massive length of 28,300 meters. The bridge links Maryland's rural Eastern Shore region and the urban Western Shore. The dual-span bridge significantly reduced travel time across the Chesapeake Bay, but its narrow lanes often pose traffic congestion problems.12. Tacoma Narrows Bridge, Tacoma, WA - 1940/1950The Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Tacoma, Washington, is more notable for its predecessor's collapse in 1940, known as ""Galloping Gertie."" The original 1940 bridge was an engineering failure due to an aeroelastic flutter that caused a spectacular collapse merely four months post-completion. The current suspension bridge, whose length is 1810 meters, exemplifies lessons learned in bridge aerodynamics.11. Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, CA - 1937San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge one of the most famous and popular bridges in the US because it symbolizes American ingenuity. The bridge's total length is about 2,737 meters, and it was the world's longest suspension bridge at its completion.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Growth Stocks: 10 Aristocrats.Dividend investing is a specialized approach that yields rewards primarily for patient investors and may not suit everyone. When investing in dividend stocks, seasoned investors pay attention to growth in their payouts over the years. Through this, they aim to benefit through a combination of growing income stream, capital appreciation, and protection against inflation. Returns of dividend growth stocks have surpassed those without any growth tracks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned RMB Capital’s research which revealed that dividend growers achieved a positive return of 9.62% from 1972 until December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79% during the same period.According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers exhibited lower volatility over the last 50 years. Due to this, many financial experts are now recommending the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental part of equity portfolios for their clients. The consistent growth and stability of dividends make them an attractive option for investors seeking reliable long-term returns. From 1973 to 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return to shareholders, whereas dividend payers and dividend non-payers returned 9.18% and -0.60%, respectively.

Some of the insurers like Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG, Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company WTW, AMERISAFE, Inc. AMSF and First American Financial Corporation FAF are set to announce quarterly results on Jul 27. However, an active catastrophe-level is likely to have weighed on their performance.Improved pricing, solid retention and exposure growth across business lines are likely to have aided premiums. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and led to better pricing in the first quarter. Per a report by MarketScout, the composite rate for the United States commercial property and casualty lines increased more than 5% in the to-be-reported quarter.JP Morgan estimates insured losses from major natural catastrophes, driven by storms in the United States, to be less than $10 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.With three rate hikes already in 2023, investment income is likely to have improved, as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment. The Fed expects to execute another interest rate hike at its next meeting.A bigger investment asset base, higher reinvestment rate and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others are expected to have aided net investment income in the second quarter.Courtesy of their solid capital position, the insurers pursued strategic mergers and acquisitions, which are likely to have diversified their portfolios, sharpened their competitive edge and expanded their geographic footprint in the second quarter. They also enhanced shareholders' value via share buybacks and dividend increases.The increased adoption of technologies is expected to have improved operational efficiency, enhanced cybersecurity, upgraded policy administration and claims systems and limited costs, thus aiding margins in the second quarter. These, in turn, are likely to have driven the profit levels of the insurance industry players.Let’s see how the abovementioned five insurers are placed ahead of their second-quarter 2022 earnings on Jul 27.Our proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

Capacity utilization rate of 94% were also in line with last year.Net income attributable to the company's stockholders was $1.9 billion, or $5.40 per share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $4.7 billion, or $11.57 per share, a year earlier.However, the company beat analysts' average estimates of $5.08 per share, according to Refinitiv data.(Reporting by Sourasis Bose in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)]"

Refining throughput volumes averaged 3.0 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2023.""We are pleased to report solid financial results in the second quarter, underpinned by strong execution across all of our business segments,"" said Lane Riggs, Valero’s Chief Executive Officer and President. ""Our refineries ran well with throughput capacity utilization at 94 percent and our U.S. wholesale system set a sales record of over 1 million barrels per day in May and June.""Renewable DieselThe Renewable Diesel segment, which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture (DGD), reported $440 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $152 million for the second quarter of 2022. Segment sales volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2023, which was 2.2 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2022. The higher sales volumes were due to the impact of additional volumes from the startup of the DGD Port Arthur plant in the fourth quarter of 2022.Story continuesEthanolThe Ethanol segment reported $127 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $101 million for the second quarter of 2022.

Excluding these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2023.Capital investments totaled $458 million in the second quarter of 2023, of which $382 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance.

Valero defines payout ratio as the sum of dividends paid and the total cost of stock buybacks divided by net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for changes in working capital and DGD’s net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in its working capital, attributable to the other joint venture member’s share of DGD.On July 20, Valero announced a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.02 per share, payable on September 5, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on August 3, 2023.Liquidity and Financial PositionValero ended the second quarter of 2023 with $9.0 billion of total debt, $2.3 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 18 percent as of June 30, 2023.Strategic UpdateThe Port Arthur Coker project, which successfully commenced operations in April, is operating well and at full capacity. The new coker has increased the refinery’s throughput capacity and enhanced its ability to process incremental volumes of heavy crudes and residual feedstocks, while also improving turnaround efficiency.The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project at the DGD Port Arthur plant is expected to be completed in 2025 and is estimated to cost $315 million, with half of that attributable to Valero. The project is expected to give the plant the ability to upgrade approximately 50 percent of its current 470 million gallon annual renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, which is expected to make DGD one of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world.""We remain committed to the core strategy that has been in place for nearly a decade,"" said Riggs. ""Our focus on operational excellence, capital discipline and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns has served us well and will continue to anchor our strategy going forward.""Conference CallValero’s senior management will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET today to discuss this earnings release and to provide an update on operations and strategy.About ValeroValero Energy Corporation, through its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Valero""), is a multinational manufacturer and marketer of petroleum-based and low-carbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products, and it sells its products primarily in the United States (""U.S.""), Canada, the United Kingdom (""U.K.""), Ireland and Latin America.

EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES(a)Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to set annual quotas for the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties, such as us, must blend into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the U.S. The quotas are used to determine an obligated party’s RVO. The EPA released a final rule on June 3, 2022 that, among other things, modified the volume standards for 2020 and, for the first time, established volume standards for 2021 and 2022.In 2020, we recognized the cost of the RVO using the 2020 quotas set by the EPA at that time, and in 2021 and the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized the cost of the RVO using our estimates of the quotas. As a result of the final rule released by the EPA as noted above, we recognized a benefit of $104 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily related to the modification of the 2020 quotas.(b)Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 includes a gain of $23 million on the sale of our ethanol plant located in Jefferson, Wisconsin (Jefferson ethanol plant).(c)General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 includes a charge of $20 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with a non-operating site.(d)""Other income, net"" includes the following:a net gain of $11 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 related to the early retirement of $199 million aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes; anda charge of $50 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 related to the early retirement of $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes.(e)We use certain financial measures (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and accompanying earnings release that are not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.Non-GAAP measures are as follows:Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders is defined as net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders adjusted to reflect the items noted below, along with their related income tax effect. The income tax effect for the adjustments was calculated using a combined federal and state statutory rate for the U.S.-based adjustments of 22.5 percent and a local statutory income tax rate for foreign-based adjustments. We have adjusted for these items because we believe that they are not indicative of our core operating performance and that their adjustment results in an important measure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our underlying business results and trends. The basis for our belief with respect to each adjustment is provided below.–Modification of RVO – The net benefit resulting from the modification of our RVO for 2020 and 2021 that was recognized by us in June 2022 is not associated with the cost of the RVO generated by our operations during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. See note (a) for additional details.–Gain on sale of ethanol plant – The gain on the sale of our Jefferson ethanol plant (see note (b)) is not indicative of our ongoing operations.–Environmental reserve adjustment – The environmental reserve adjustment (see note (c)) is attributable to a site that was shut down by prior owners and subsequently acquired by us (referred to by us as a non-operating site).–Loss (gain) on early retirement of debt – Discounts, premiums, and other expenses recognized in connection with the early retirement of various series of our senior notes (see note (d)) are not associated with the ongoing costs of our borrowing and financing activities.Adjusted earnings per common share – assuming dilution is defined as adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders divided by the number of weighted-average shares outstanding in the applicable period, assuming dilution.Refining margin is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification of RVO adjustment (see note (a)), operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. We believe Refining margin is an important measure of our Refining segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.Renewable Diesel margin is defined as Renewable Diesel segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe Renewable Diesel margin is an important measure of our Renewable Diesel segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.Ethanol margin is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. We believe Ethanol margin is an important measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance.Adjusted Refining operating income is defined as Refining segment operating income excluding the modification of RVO adjustment (see note (a)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Refining operating income is an important measure of our Refining segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that are not indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.Adjusted Ethanol operating income is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding the gain on sale of ethanol plant (see note (b)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted Ethanol operating income is an important measure of our Ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that are not indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding the items noted below. We believe adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is an important measure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our ability to generate cash to fund our investing and financing activities. The basis for our belief with respect to each excluded item is provided below.–Changes in current assets and current liabilities – Current assets net of current liabilities represents our operating liquidity. We believe that the change in our operating liquidity from period to period does not represent cash generated by our operations that is available to fund our investing and financing activities.–DGD’s adjusted net cash provided by operating activities attributable to the other joint venture member’s ownership interest in DGD – We are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and we consolidate DGD’s financial statements. Our Renewable Diesel segment includes the operations of DGD and the associated activities to market its products. Because we consolidate DGD’s financial statements, all of DGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities.DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Nevertheless, DGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member and only 50 percent of DGD’s operating cash flow should be attributed to our net cash provided by operating activities. Therefore, we have adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities for the portion of DGD’s operating cash flow attributable to the other joint venture member’s ownership interest because we believe that it more accurately reflects the operating cash flow available to us to fund our investing and financing activities. The adjustment is calculated as follows (in millions):Three Months EndedJune 30,Six Months EndedJune 30,2023202220232022DGD operating cash flow dataNet cash provided by operating activities$586$128$515$149Exclude: Changes in current assets andcurrent liabilities102(51)(216)(200)Adjusted net cash provided by operatingactivities484179731349Other joint venture member’s ownership interest50%50%50%50%DGD’s adjusted net cash provided byoperating activities attributable to the otherjoint venture member’s ownership interest inDGD$242$90$365$175Capital investments attributable to Valero is defined as all capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the portion of DGD’s capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of VIEs other than DGD.DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of total capital investments. We also exclude the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we consolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.(f)The Refining segment regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: U.S. Gulf Coast- Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; U.S. Mid Continent- Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; North Atlantic- Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and U.S. West Coast- Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(g)Primarily includes petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.(h)Valero uses certain operating statistics (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and the accompanying earnings release to evaluate performance between comparable periods. Different companies may calculate them in different ways.All per barrel of throughput, per gallon of sales, and per gallon of production amounts are calculated by dividing the associated dollar amount by the throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the period, as applicable.Throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput volumes per day, sales volumes per day, and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables), respectively, by the number of days in the applicable period. We use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the Refining segment, Renewable Diesel segment, and Ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in our segments. We believe the use of such volumes results in per unit amounts that are most representative of the product margins generated and the operating costs incurred as a result of our operation of those facilities.(i)The RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program. The RVO cost is calculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the RINs associated with each class of renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the quotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the U.S., as set or proposed by the EPA, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding together the results of each calculation.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230726838554/en/ContactsInvestors:Homer Bhullar, Vice President – Investor Relations and Finance, 210-345-1982Eric Herbort, Director – Investor Relations and Finance, 210-345-3331Gautam Srivastava, Director – Investor Relations, 210-345-3992Media:Lillian Riojas, Executive Director – Media Relations and Communications, 210-345-5002]"

Healthcare is generally less macro-sensitive than some other sectors. In a reversal of market sentiment compared to 2022, the healthcare sector has been under modest pressure due to what we consider to be some short-term transitory issues, while technology, particularly anything to do with AI, has become the market’s dish du jour. We have been selectively increasing our investment in a few very high-quality healthcare businesses at prices we consider to be fair. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is now a top 10 holding, and our investment thesis is outlined in this report.We have previously written on our exposure to taxes through our investment in Intuit and its market leading TurboTax franchise (Intuit also owns the QuickBooks small business accounting franchise, Credit Karma and Mailchimp).

The success of the markets has largely been based on a larger narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), specifically generative AI and other similar technology. Considering the wide-ranging impact of AI on the markets, investors and finance-minded individuals, in general, are looking at this technology as a way to make the most money they can while they still have the chance.On July 10, CNBC quoted Matt Higgins, a self-made millionaire and the CEO of investment firm RSE Ventures, as commenting that ""AI will be the greatest wealth creator in history."" According to Higgins, this technology has no regard for an individual's background or anything else, giving the global public a chance to try their own hand at making money without any barriers holding them back. Higgins is also not the only person to believe in AI as a money-making technology, as people all across the world are becoming engaged in things like freelancing and entrepreneurship with the help of AI today. At the same time, investors are considering this technology as the turning point in the business journeys of many companies. AI is presenting all sorts of possibilities to a variety of companies today, allowing them to innovate and come up with different products and services that can get them back in demand with consumers and investors alike. This is why many stocks that have remained under the radar for investors for a long time are now beginning to make a name for themselves again.Story continuesHow Are Overlooked Stocks Playing The AI Boom?Many companies, like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), have been using AI to their advantage. These moves have started to garner support for these companies in light of their stellar financial profiles and their efforts to play the AI boom in their favor. Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), for instance, has been using AI to track plants across different weather, soil types, and sun exposure to see the impact of these different conditions on plants for its agricultural operations. The company's latest earnings report from the second quarter also showed that it beat EPS estimates by $1.18 with its $9.65 EPS, while its revenue of $16.08 billion also beat estimates by $1.21 billion. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) has a similar story with a $9.38 EPS in the first quarter beating estimates by $0.18, and revenues of $26.74 billion, also beating estimates by $344.84 million, while the company is also engaged in AI operations.Stocks like these have solid profiles, and their recent ventures in the AI space are making professionals consider them to be some of the best under-the-radar stocks to buy if you're looking to pick up stocks that can play the AI boom. Considering the immense growth potential companies like these seem to have, they may even be considered to be some of the best undervalued stocks to buy now or some of the top undervalued stocks in the S&amp;P 500 overall. Keeping this in mind, we have compiled a list of 11 such stocks below.11 Best Under The Radar Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe first picked 25 stocks named by other sources online as some of the top under-the-radar stocks on the market today.

In the coming years, we expect the company to benefit from an acceleration in US manufacturing investment to support customers’ nearshoring initiatives and in response to federal government incentive programs to manufacture energy transition products domestically. In addition, we expect Rockwell to experience revenue and margin tailwinds in 2023 from easing supply chain constraints, which limited its ability to meet customer demand in 2022.”Like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is an overlooked stock that is popular among hedge funds this year.9. Equinix, Inc.

We initiated our Interactive Brokers position last summer and published a write-up in September 2022. Interactive Brokers continues to trade at a discounted multiple as investors are skeptical that the company will continue to sustain the current level of net interest income beyond the near future. However, recent reports showing strength in the US economy and labor market suggest that interest rates won’t be cut in the near term. The company publishes monthly KPI metrics and investors appear to be ignoring recent strength in trading volume and margin loans. The current market environment of rising stock prices and elevated interest rates is a goldilocks environment for the company. With this last buy, we have now reached our limit of investing 10% of our portfolio at cost in the stock and can no longer increase the holding size.”7. LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA) is another investment banking and brokerage company on our list. It is based in San Diego, California.

The weakness was largely driven by turmoil in the banking industry after the failure of SVB, which caused investors to sour on financial stocks in general. We believe LPL is immune from most of the issues facing banks. LPL is not a bank itself, has a relatively small balance sheet, and has a low-risk, short-duration securities portfolio. The banking crisis has caused investors to take a more dovish view on the path of interest rates, which is a headwind to LPL’s earnings as the economics on a large portion of client cash is tied to floating rates. However, we believe the company has an attractive growth profile even in a lower interest rate environment.”6. Expedia Group, Inc.

The company offers a wide range of travel shopping and reservation services, as well as provides real-time access to schedule, pricing and availability information for airlines, hotels and car rental companies.

The company also benefits from rapid growth in alternative accommodations, vacation home rental, through VRBO. The main sources of revenue and profitability are from hotel and vacation home rental. Additionally Expedia has exposure to airline ticket sales and automobile rentals. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, Expedia’s debt has been reduced and share repurchase has resumed and we would expect a dividend to be reinstated.”Like Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Humana Inc.

The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency revenue information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating prior year revenue in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all companies that report revenue growth on a constant currency basis calculate such measure in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.The following unaudited table compares revenue and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2023   2022   2023   2022 (In millions) % of Revenue  % of Revenue  % of Revenue  % of RevenueRevenue           Wholesale - North America$1,199   $1,144   $2,428   $2,345  Europe 1,638    1,477    3,193    2,965  Specialty 443    513    840    974  Self Service 169    208    338    407  Eliminations (1)   (1)   (2)   (2) Total revenue$3,448   $3,341   $6,797   $6,689  Segment EBITDA           Wholesale - North America$248 20.6% $214 18.7% $500 20.6% $432 18.4%Europe 188 11.5%  160 10.8%  339 10.6%  291 9.8%Specialty 42 9.5%  69 13.4%  73 8.7%  127 13.1%Self Service 7 4.1%  32 15.3%  29 8.7%  72 17.6%Total Segment EBITDA$485 14.1% $475 14.2% $941 13.8% $922 13.8%We have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit and loss and underlying trends in our ongoing operations. We calculate Segment EBITDA as Net Income attributable to LKQ stockholders excluding discontinued operations; depreciation, amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax expense; restructuring and transaction related expenses (which includes restructuring expenses recorded in Cost of goods sold); change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict and related sanctions (including provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability and expenditures to support our employees and their families). Our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, uses Segment EBITDA as the key measure of our segment profit or loss. We use Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among our segments and evaluate business strategies. This financial measure is included in the metrics used to determine incentive compensation for our senior management. We also consider Segment EBITDA to be a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance, as it provides investors, securities analysts and other interested parties with supplemental information regarding the underlying trends in our ongoing operations. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue.

We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders as Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share adjusted to eliminate the impact of discontinued operations, restructuring and transaction related expenses, amortization expense related to all acquired intangible assets, gains and losses on debt extinguishment, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures (including gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts related to the Uni-Select transaction), impairment charges, direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict and related sanctions (including provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability and expenditures to support our employees and their families), interest and financing costs related to the Uni-Select transaction prior to closing, excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments and any tax effect of these adjustments. The tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period or for certain discrete items the specific tax expense or benefit for the adjustment. Given the variability and volatility of the amount related transactions in a particular period, management believes that these costs are not core operating expenses and should be adjusted in our calculation of Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders. Our adjustment of the amortization of all acquisition-related intangible assets does not exclude the amortization of other assets, which represents expense that is directly attributable to ongoing operations. Management believes that the adjustment relating to amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. The acquired intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. These financial measures are used by management in its decision making and overall evaluation of our operating performance and are included in the metrics used to determine incentive compensation for our senior management. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders should not be construed as alternatives to Net Income or Diluted Earnings per Share as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all companies that report measures similar to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.The following unaudited table reconciles Forecasted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders to Forecasted Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders, respectively: Forecasted  Fiscal Year 2023(In millions, except per share data)Minimum Outlook Maximum OutlookNet income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders$981  $1,035 Adjustments:   Amortization of acquired intangibles 60   60 Restructuring and transaction related expenses 48   48 Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related (46)  (46)Pre-acquisition interest expense, net of interest income 22   22 Other adjustments (2)  (2)Tax effect of adjustments (14)  (14)Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders$1,049  $1,103     Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 269.0   269.0     Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders:   U.S. GAAP$3.65  $3.85 Non-GAAP (Adjusted)$3.90  $4.10 We have presented forecasted Adjusted Net Income and forecasted Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders in our financial outlook.

We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. We believe free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning our cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements, make strategic acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase stock. We believe free cash flow is used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the liquidity of other companies, many of which present free cash flow when reporting their results. This financial measure is included in the metrics used to determine incentive compensation for our senior management. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all companies that report free cash flow information calculate free cash flow in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for liquidity relative to other companies.We also evaluate our free cash flow by measuring the conversion of Adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow. For the denominator of our conversion ratio, we calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to LKQ stockholders excluding discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest, gains and losses on debt extinguishment, income tax expense, gains and losses on the disposal of businesses, and other unusual income and expense items that affect investing or financing cash flows. We exclude gains and losses on the disposal of businesses as the proceeds are included in investing cash flows, which is outside of free cash flow.

So far this earnings season, four S&amp;P sector components — namely Tesla, Genuine Parts, PACCAR and General Motors — have come up with quarterly numbers. EV king Tesla, trucking giant PACCAR and U.S. legacy automaker General Motors managed to pull off a comprehensive beat and witnessed year-over-year growth in the top and bottom lines. Meanwhile, auto replacement parts provider Genuine Parts’ earnings topped estimates but sales missed the same. Revenues and profit, however, increased on a year-over-year basis.Ford F, Harley-Davidson HOG, Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN and LKQ Corp LEA are some of the auto stocks lined up to report tomorrow. Before checking the key projections for these stocks, let's take a look at the general factors that are likely to shape the companies’ upcoming results.With supply chain issues easing this year, the U.S. auto market has regained momentum. Most automakers experienced year-over-year vehicle sales growth in the second quarter of 2023, thanks to improving inventory levels. Additionally, the demand for automobiles remained strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates has not yet significantly affected purchasing decisions.The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for June 2023 was 15.7-15.8 million vehicles, up from 15.1 million vehicles in May 2023 and 12.9 million units in June 2022. Per Cox Automotive, new vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, implying year-over-year and sequential growth of roughly 15% and 13%, respectively.Per the latest Earnings Trend report dated Jul 19, the auto sector’s earnings for the second quarter of 2023 are expected to grow 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to rise 17.1% year over year.Key Releases on Jul 27Ford: This legacy automaker surpassed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter on higher-than-expected revenues. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford topped earnings estimates on two occasions for as many misses, with the average surprise being 24.35%. This is depicted in the graph below:Story continuesFord Motor Company Price and EPS SurpriseFord Motor Company Price and EPS SurpriseFord Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company QuoteOur proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ford this time around. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +6.43% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at 50 cents per share. F is set to report quarterly results after the closing bell.Ford recorded sales growth of 11.2% in the United States during the second quarter of 2023. Its F-Series became America’s top-selling truck, with a 34% rise in sales in the quarter. Ford’s second-quarter revenues are likely to have been aided by a projected increase in Ford Blue wholesale units. For the to-be-reported quarter, our estimate for Ford Blue wholesale shipments is pegged at 720,000 units, indicating an increase from 670,000 units in the year-ago period.Our forecast for second-quarter Ford Blue sales is $24,061 million, implying an uptick from $23,834 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022. On the flip side, we expect a year-over-year decline in the adjusted EBIT from Ford Blue, Ford Credit and Ford Next. Our projection for operating loss from Model e unit is at $907.8 million, wider than $510 million recorded a year ago.Harley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle manufacturer posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on higher-than-anticipated revenues from the Motorcycles &amp; Related Products and Financial Services segments. HOG surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 230.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHarley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHarley-Davidson, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteOur model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Harley-Davidson this time around, as it carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -3.57%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.40 a share. HOG will unveil results before market open.Harley-Davidson is likely to have benefited from the Hardwire strategic plan, which aims at growth through refreshed product offerings. Our estimate for HOG’s revenues from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment — which constitutes the bulk of the firm’s overall revenues — is pegged at $1,325.5 million for the June-ended quarter, suggesting an increase of 4.7% year over year.We project operating profit from the segment to grow around 23% from the year-ago period. On the flip side, our forecast for revenues from Financial Services is pegged at $200.9 million, suggesting a fall from $202.6 million generated in the year-ago period. Our model estimate for operating profit from the segment is $66.7 million, implying a decline from $85.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022.LKQ: This automotive replacement parts provider posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter due to better-than-expected revenues from Wholesale North American, European and Self-Service segments. LKQ surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 2.54%. This is depicted in the graph below:LKQ Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLKQ Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLKQ Corporation price-eps-surprise | LKQ Corporation QuoteOur model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for LKQ this time around, as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.06 a share. LKQ will unveil results before market open.LKQ’s North America segment results are likely to get a boost from pricing initiatives. The company’s 1 LKQ Europe program is expected to aid the performance of the Europe segment. Moreover, the strength in LKQ’s Specialty unit on the back of solid demand for recreational vehicles bodes well.Our estimate for revenues from parts and services in Europe is pegged at $1,500 million, suggesting a rise from $1,470 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.We expect revenues from parts and services in the North America unit at around $1,103.7 million, indicating a rise from $1,050 million recorded in the prior-year period. However, our projection for the Specialty segment stands at $447.5 million, implying a decline from $512 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Allison: The transmission manufacturer posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on higher-than-anticipated sales from North America On-Highway, North America Off-Highway and Service Parts, Support Equipment &amp; Other end markets. ALSN surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 12.84%. This is depicted in the graph below:Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. QuoteOur model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ALSN this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +0.11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.59 a share. ALSN will unveil results after market close.For second-quarter 2023, we estimate North America On-Highway and Off-Highway market revenues to be around $358 million and $23.7 million, up from $340 million and $20 million, respectively, reported in the corresponding quarter of 2022. Our forecast for Outside North America On-Highway market revenues is $119 million, up from $105 million recorded in the year-ago period. Our projections for Outside North America Off-Highway market revenues suggest a year-over-year decline of 2.9%.We expect revenues from the Defense and the Service Parts, Support Equipment/ Other segments at $35.5 million and $162 million, respectively, suggesting an uptick from $29 million and $138 million, respectively. While expected sales growth from most segments boost optimism, logistics challenges, including air and ocean freight and port delays, labor constraints and high engineering costs are likely to have played a spoiler in the to-be-reported quarter.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Danyal HussainThank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO.Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter and full year. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.I'll now turn it over to Maria.Story continuesMaria BlackThank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter that included 9% organic constant currency revenue growth, 270 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 26% adjusted EPS growth. And for our full year fiscal 2023, we delivered 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 130 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 17% adjusted EPS growth representing another strong year for ADP.I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. Our worldwide sales and marketing team delivered exceptional Q4 Employer Services, new business Bookings growth that was well in excess of our expectations with strong double-digit overall growth on top of a difficult comparison. The HCM demand environment has been healthy despite a gradually slowing macroeconomic backdrop, and we have been capitalizing on this study demand.Our strong bookings results were broad-based. We had continued strength in our down market and Employer Services HRO offerings, we also had better-than-expected results in our mid-market as well as a great finish from our compliance and international businesses. This Q4 performance brought our full year Employer Services bookings growth to 10% compared to our 6% to 9% guidance and our medium-term goal of 7% to 8% growth that we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day. We are, of course, thrilled with this result and excited to keep the momentum going.Our Employer Services retention rate was another highlight in Q4 and came in better than we expected. For the full year, we delivered a retention rate increase of 10 basis points and are back to our record level retention rate of 92.2%, all while absorbing the impact of normalization in the down market out of business rates. This strong result was driven by record-level retention rates, specifically in our U.S. mid-market and international businesses and by record level overall client satisfaction across our major businesses in the fourth quarter.Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 3% for the quarter as the overall labor market continued to show resilience, bringing the full year pays per control figure to 5%. We have been pleased all year to see such durable labor demand from our clients. And last, while our PEO revenue growth performed in line with our expectations this quarter, we were pleased to experience a further acceleration in PEO bookings with strong double-digit growth in Q4, representing another record level sales quarter.Moving on, while Don will cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook, I wanted to spend a few minutes sharing our strategic priorities as we look ahead. Change and increase in complexity are secular growth drivers for the HCM industry. And our breadth enables us to address nearly any HCM challenge our clients may face and meet them wherever they may be on their HR journey. From start-up to enterprise, from software-only to fully outsourced, and from local to global, we see a tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And while our specific growth initiatives will vary by business, there are 3 key strategic priorities, which apply across all of ADP that I see as critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead.The first strategic priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology, put simply, our goal is to design, develop and deliver the very best and most innovative solutions that will help our clients navigate the full life cycle of employment. From hiring employees to onboarding and training them, providing insurance for them, paying them and filing payroll taxes and even setting them up for retirement. As much as we offer today, we see an incredible opportunity to improve on our current and next-gen solutions, tactically used partnerships and inorganic means to further accelerate our pace of innovation and continues to offer industry-leading HCM products, and we expect to have a busy fiscal 2024. For U.S. small businesses, we are rolling out several product enhancements that will serve our 850,000 RUN clients, including a new tax ID registration, service-learning management to help with small business employee training and an insurance inspector tool that utilizes AI to help clients manage their workers' compensation, insurance policies and annual audits.For U.S. midsized businesses served by Workforce Now, our focus is to continue our great momentum in the deployment of our Next Gen Payroll and time engine and to drive our win rates and client satisfaction even higher. In the U.S. enterprise space, we expect to nearly finish the migrations of 3 of our remaining legacy platforms by the end of this fiscal year representing an important step in our multiyear journey to move our clients to more modern platforms.We are also pleased to have advanced the velocity of our Next Gen HCM implementations, and we expect our Next Gen HCM sales to contribute in a more meaningful way to our bookings growth in fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., we intend to scale our iHCM mid-market platform in fiscal 2024, adding at least 1,000 clients over the course of the year. I am also incredibly excited to share that we will begin offering role outside the U.S. in fiscal 2024 to drive incremental growth.We plan to launch initially in 2 countries in Europe and expand its reach from there, and we intend to continue growing our Asia Pacific business, in part by leveraging our recent acquisition of a strong mid-market time product to supplement our existing payroll functionality. And across a few of our platforms, including Workforce Now and Roll, we intend to deploy Gen AI-powered features to help our clients more quickly and easily tackle certain HR transactions.Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing to our clients. We pride ourselves on serving as a true partner to each and every one of our 1 million clients. Our culture of client service applies equally across our entire business, from a basic payroll client to a fully outsourced client where we run part or all of the HR department. Our expertise and partnership approach has been key to ADP's winning formula for decades, and we will continue to lean into it. We expect that to manifest in a few ways in fiscal 2024.We have recently been piloting a number of tools powered by Gen AI that can help our service and implementation associates deliver an even better client experience, and we will begin deploying these more broadly in early fiscal 2024. Given the significant number of clients we onboard and interact with every year, we expect to learn quite a bit this year about the longer-term benefits we and our clients might realize from Gen AI.Meanwhile, demand for our HR outsourcing solutions remains very strong. And in fiscal 2024, we are focused on reaching new clients and further improving the experience for existing ones. Our Employer Services HRO businesses have been performing incredibly well, and our focus for fiscal 2024 is to continue delivering strong bookings and keep client satisfaction and retention at current levels, or perhaps even reach new record levels. And our focus for our PEO business in fiscal 2024 is to maintain our recent strong bookings momentum by continuing to add to our sales force headcount, grow our referral partner network, and use data and machine learning to identify existing ADP clients who may be a strong fit for an upgrade.Our third and final strategic priority is to leverage our global scale for the benefit of our clients. Our size and scale are unmatched in the industry. Across the globe, we not only offer robust platforms and a commitment to industry-leading service and expertise, but we also provide a scaled ecosystem and a unique on-the-ground presence in over 30 countries. This combination positions us to interact routinely with local governments and tax authorities, meet stringent certification and data requirements, and stay on top of complex and shifting legal requirements.Globally, we bring together our incredible data in array of partners and integrated solutions in one of the biggest and best business-to-business sales forces in the world to help our clients and prospects navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we will continue to build on that scale for the benefit of our clients. Our GlobalView platform supports hundreds of the world's largest multinational companies with scaled workforces in over 40 countries, and our Celergo platform helps us serve thousands more in up to 140 countries.In fiscal 2024, we expect to expand on both as we add additional countries to GlobalView's broad reach and as we potentially make tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our native in-country footprint. After establishing an ADP in-country presence in 5 new markets in 2023, we expect to expand further in fiscal 2024. Our world-class global scale distribution, led by over 8,500 sellers is being supported by headcount and marketing investment in 2024, and as we've shared with you in the past few quarters, our sellers will continue to be paired with a best-in-class sales tech stack, which we plan to enhance with Gen AI functionality in the coming months. And our ability to provide data-driven insights will continue to grow in fiscal 2024.ADP serves more clients and pay more people around the world than ever. And as we continue growing the number of employees we serve globally, the power of our insights will likewise continue to increase and benefit our clients. I am incredibly excited about these 3 strategic priorities for ADP, and the differentiation and growth they will continue to drive.But before turning it over to Don, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our associates for their effort and performance over the course of this year. Our associates and body are core values like insightful expertise, service excellence and being results driven. In fiscal 2023, ADP was recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune Magazine for the 17th consecutive year, signifying the incredibly strong culture we have and the important role we play in the world.Additionally, we were recently recognized for the first time as one of the best companies for innovators by Fast Company, a true testament to the direction we are headed in. We owe these accolades as well as our strong, consistent financial performance to the commitment and effort of our 63,000 associates that make up the ADP family.With that, I'll turn it over to Don.Don Edward McGuireThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Q4 performance was very strong overall, driving fiscal '23 results at or above our expectations. As Maria mentioned, these results reflected broad-based strength in Employer Services and PEO new business bookings, better-than-anticipated Employer Services retention and continued healthy Employer Services pays per control growth yielding 10% organic constant currency revenue growth for the year, and bringing us to $18 billion in revenue.For our Employer Services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 11% on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. This stronger-than-expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance in retention and pays per control growth as well as a better than anticipated contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 480 basis points in the fourth quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations.For the full year, our ES revenue grew 10% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 190 basis points. Growth in client funds interest helped us in a year in which we added a fair amount to our product, service and sales headcount, which has driven some fairly substantial benefits in sales, Net Promoter Score and retention results.For our PEO, revenue increased 4% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q3 as we anticipated. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to 722,000 and has started to gradually reaccelerate supported by very strong bookings growth in Q4. PEO margin contracted 110 basis points in the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations due in part to higher selling expenses. For the full year, our PEO revenue grew 8% and average worksite employees increased 6% and our margin expanded 60 basis points, all in line with our most recent guidance.I'll now turn to our outlook for fiscal '24. While the economic backdrop remains uncertain, we continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver solid overall financial results while also investing for future growth, consistent with the strategic priorities that Maria laid out. Our fiscal '24 outlook assumes some moderation in economic activity over the course of the year, but nothing dramatic.Beginning with ES segment revenue, we expect growth of 7% to 8%, driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing a solid growth after a particularly strong fiscal '23. For now, we're assuming a stronger first half and some moderation in second half bookings growth, which we think is prudent given the limited visibility into the macro environment.For ES retention, we finished fiscal '23 at a record level of 92.2%, consistently outperforming our expectations throughout the year. We are, of course, very pleased with this performance as we overcame headwinds from higher down market out of business levels with strength elsewhere. With that said, we are contemplating a 50 to 70 basis points ES retention decline for fiscal '24 due in part to an assumption that small business losses will increase slightly from where they are today as well as an assumption for general impact to our other businesses from a slowing economic backdrop.As we called out 3 months ago, we see the potential for below normal pays per control growth in fiscal '24, and our outlook assumes 1% to 2% growth for the year. We had a strong Q4, which gives us a solid starting point for growth and a gradual deceleration over the course of the year feels reasonable at this time. And as the price contributed 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23, we are anticipating a smaller contribution in fiscal '24, though still above our recent historical average contribution of around 50 basis points.And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop has been dynamic these past few months, and it is important to keep in mind that our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which will, of course, evolve as we move through fiscal '24. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.4% in fiscal '23 to 2.8% in fiscal '24. We meanwhile expect our average client funds balances to grow 2% to 3% in fiscal '24. This is a bit lower than recent trends due primarily to more modest contribution from pays per control growth and an assumption for more moderate wage increases. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $813 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $955 million to $975 million in fiscal '24.Meanwhile, we expect the net impact from our client fund strategy to increase from $730 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $815 to $835 million in fiscal '24. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 130 to 150 basis points driven by operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue, offset by continued investments across our strategic priorities.Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenue and PO revenue excluding 0 margin pass-through to grow 3% to 5% in fiscal '24. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 3% to 4%. This represents a gradual reacceleration from the 3% growth we're stepping off of in Q4. Strong bookings performance has already contributed to accelerating client growth, but that has so far been offset by slowing pays per control growth.With continued strong bookings growth, our worksite employee growth should gradually reaccelerate as well. And as Maria shared, demand has been healthy, and we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity in PEO. We expect PEO margin to be down between 20 and 40 basis points in fiscal '24 due to anticipated higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23.Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '24. And our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23%. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, supported by buybacks. One quick note on cadence. At this point, we expect total revenue growth to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter, but we expect our adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly in Q1 on a year-over-year basis and then build over the course of the year.Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.Owen Robert CallahanThis is Owen on for Ramsey. I appreciate you taking our question today. I was just curious more on kind of your PEO revenue guidance. I know you called out worksite employee growth weighing on growth there. But you expect double-digit kind of bookings growth and projects only 3% to 5% growth in PEO revenues for fiscal '24. I was just curious if you can provide any more color on that spread, is it's any conservatism or if there are any other factors to consider there?Don Edward McGuireOwen, thanks. Yes, I'll answer the question. We had a very, very strong sales bookings result in Q4. So we're very happy with that, and we've seen the sales reaccelerate. I think as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing continued growth in clients. I think if there's a challenge that we're facing a little bit is we're seeing a little bit softer pays per control growth in the PEO than we would have expected. But back to what we've been saying for some time, we think the underlying value proposition is very, very strong, and we look to that business continue to grow for us and be a big part of our portfolio.OperatorOur next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.Samad Saleem SamanaCongrats on the strong end to the fiscal year. Maybe first question, Maria, I thought it was very interesting about the announcement of moving the Roll into new international markets. How should we think about maybe what the opportunity there looks like? How much different is the complexity around payroll processing in international markets versus the U.S.? And have you included that in the bookings forecast for fiscal '24?Maria BlackYes. Fair enough. Thanks, Samad. And I appreciate the congratulations on the quarter and the year. We're obviously pretty proud over here. So with respect to Roll, it is exciting. It's been an exciting product for us to roll out, no pun intended across the down market here in the U.S. We're excited to take it into international. As mentioned, the initial goal is to put it into 2 countries, and it is an incremental add for us because it's really initially into these 2 countries. We're thinking more kind of the down-market SMB space, which is an area of opportunity for us across many of the markets that we serve. But we're also excited about role long term beyond that space. And so excited to dip it into our international space as we have continued the overall rollout of Roll.In terms of factoring it into the overall bookings, not really. I think the -- by the time the launch happens and as we're thinking about the full year for our international business or full year for new business bookings, I'd be surprised if it ultimately makes a dent. But to us, it's really about the long-term value that, that offer will bring as we seek to expand the addressable market for us into these various places.Last but not least, Samad, you mentioned the complexity of being international. And I have to tell you, I spoke to it a little bit in the prepared remarks. There's a lot that goes into being in each one of these countries. To your point, there's complexity country by country. Many countries put many of the states that are complex, here in the U.S. to [shame] in terms of the complexity that provides. And that's everything from government entities, legal tax attorneys, who is the tax authority and how do you get to them. We often think of it as an ecosystem. We think about it as kind of that final mile, if you will, and that's the complexity, and that's what we've been building over the last couple of decades in our international business.So it's a lot more than dropping off software at a country border and hoping that it works. There's a lot to be said for the ecosystem around it, again, whether it's tax authorities, state lodgements, things of that nature. So excited to take advantage of the footprint we've built and put in our products into that footprint as we expand Roll internationally.Samad Saleem SamanaVery helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Don. I know you gave -- you called out that broad base strength that drove the bookings upside and you cited several specific factors. I guess it would be helpful if you could maybe help us dimensionalize where the upside was relative to the company's own expectations at maybe the start of fiscal '23? And what you're carrying forward from what you saw in the fourth quarter into the FY '24 bookings outlook?Don Edward McGuireYes, Samad, thanks for the question. I'll start here, and I think I'll turn it over to Maria for the bookings. But we certainly saw a strength across the board. I think once again, in the prepared remarks, we called out the -- our tax business and our international business. So they were very strong amongst all the ones that were strong and the down market was also quite strong. So it was really a contribution from across the board in the fourth quarter.We talked for some time about how the pipelines are healthy and whatnot, and you've had questions before about times to get signatures on deals, et cetera. Things came together in the fourth quarter, and we were very, very pleased with the final result.Maria BlackThat's right. I -- my only add to that comment would be, we stepped into the quarter with healthy pipelines with a strong staffing position that was growing tenure. I have to tell you, when I reflect on all the quarters that I've watched across our sales execution, generally speaking, you have a bunch of businesses that are outperforming and you have a few businesses that are perhaps being carried by those that are outperforming. What I have to tell you is this was a broad-based strength across the entire organization sales implementation service, with kind of an all hands on deck execution, and that's really what it's all about. What I would attribute it to is incredible execution.OperatorOur next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.Bryan C. BerginI wanted to follow up on U.S. bookings here. So you cited several areas of strength, mid-market, compliance and international. On the mid-market specifically, can you talk about what's driving that better-than-expected performance? Do you think that's driving improved competitive performance versus kind of rising tide environment? And then just I heard you comment on Next Gen HCM contributing more in the current fiscal year to bookings. Maybe talk about the initiatives and the product development that you think is going to drive that?Maria BlackBryan, so I'll comment on both. The mid-market strength that we've seen and it coming in a bit better than expected. It's been solid for quite some time. That's inclusive of our HRO offerings, and as you know, we've been speaking to those quite a bit in terms of the resonance of that value proposition in the market. So I think that adds to the overall strength that we have in the mid-market, which is the various flavors and offers that we have.I think the other is that we've made tremendous investments into that business. So we do have our Next Generation Payroll engine that the sales force is pretty excited about and we're seeing that the wins that are coming in and just kind of the momentum there. I think the other is the amount of product investment and innovation that we've done in the mid-market, specifically referencing the investments we've made into the Workforce Now platform with the new UX and many of the things that I've been speaking to.And I think the other call out is it definitely helps on a new business bookings perspective, when the business on the other side, so service and NPS, if you will, as well as retention are firing on all cylinders. And that's exactly the case. We have record retention in our mid-market, and we have near-record NPS results across the mid-market. So really, really proud of the execution in that entire space. And that definitely fuels and feeds the ability for our sellers to get excited about everything that I just mentioned to go to market.Stepping into the question around Next Gen HCM, I did make a reference to that. We've talked a lot over the last quarters about this year. And what we've been working on is scaling implementation, and that's exactly what we've done in that business. So we were able to onboard a lot of the clients that we had on our backlog. We've shortened the time of implementation, and we also saw additions to that backlog.So we saw new sales in the fourth quarter of that Next Generation HCM platform. We're really excited about the momentum as we step into '24. And as such, we believe that Next Gen HCM will be a larger contributor to bookings for us in the upcoming year than it was in '23, but we were pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter and the momentum heading in.Bryan C. BerginOkay. Understood. And then just on pricing, can you comment on where that ended up in fiscal '23 and what you're assuming in ES growth from a pricing standpoint in fiscal '24?Don Edward McGuireYes. So we were happy with our price increase and retention. So as we've talked to many times, we want to make sure that we're not getting greedy. So we did get about 150-basis points of price in the year. And we did that without the expense of seeing a decline in retention or NPS scores. And quite frankly, those NPS scores have stayed healthy despite the price increase. So as much as price increases can land well, they have landed well, and we're very happy with how that transpired throughout '23.For '24, we do expect to have price increases again. We do not think that we're going to be in the 150 basis point range. We're certainly going to be above our historical average of about 50 basis points. But once again, we'll watch closely and make sure that the underlying value proposition for our clients stays in place, and we'll take some price for sure, but not to the extent that we did in FY '23.OperatorOur next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangWith the great bookings here, I'm just thinking around the conversion. You mentioned implementation cycles. I'm just curious if you've seen any change from clients and their desire to implement. And then similarly, just maybe based on your comments there on Next Gen HCM, I'd love to hear a little bit more around the appetite from your prospects to upgrade now at this point in the cycle. What's the pitch here given some of the macro uncertainty?Maria BlackSo I think both of your questions, I just want to confirm, I'm hearing them the right way. I think they both kind of speak to the general sentiment around the demand environment. Is that kind of a good way to think about it?Tien-Tsin HuangYes.Maria BlackIn terms of decisions getting delayed and/or what's the appetite to, I suppose, by HCM in the current macro environment. And so I'll comment on the general demand environment and feel free to follow-up with an additional question if I didn't cover what you wanted. But the way that I think about demand, and I've spoken to it quite a bit over the last couple of quarters. Demand remains strong, and that is very broad-based across the business. And so if you think about the down market, you still have the strength of small business formations. You have the strength of hiring that's happening in the down market. And as such you have clients there needing to make decisions around our HCM offers in that space, right?So that's definitely a place that we've been winning, and we'll continue to lean in as warranted by the demand. The mid-market, as we talked about that a little bit earlier in terms of the overall demand there for the complexity that exists in that market. That's inclusive again of the solution we have around our HR outsourcing offerings. And so that's kind of the mid-market.So getting to your question, which is really about the enterprise space and perhaps even the MNC space, it is an area that we continue to watch as it relates to demand cycles, decision delays. And the main reason is those are really the places that you -- as you're aware, have additional, perhaps signers, additional levels of approval, things of that nature. And what I would say, which is consistent with what we've been seeing, is that we are back to pre-pandemic levels. So deal cycles did shorten during the pandemic, and they elongated back the pre-pandemic. But it isn't something that we're seeing additional elongation beyond historical averages.And so to your point, though, it is an area that we consistently watch both in the enterprise space as well as in our international business, just to kind of see if the demand cycle is at the client's appetite to make buying decisions or implementation decisions during this time has changed thus far. We're not seeing it in a broad-based way. But it is an area that we continue to monitor.Tien-Tsin HuangOkay. No, that's great. You answered it better than I asked the question. Just on the -- as a quick follow-up, just I heard a lot about the sales and the go-to-market investments that makes sense. Just how about R&amp;D growth here in the upcoming year versus fiscal '23? How might growth be different? And also, how might the composition be different in terms of where you're placing your bets on R&amp;D. That's all I had.Don Edward McGuireYes. I think we have a number of projects that we've shared with you all over the past number of quarters. Those projects are well underway. We won't spend a lot of time talking about specific Gen AI product -- projects, but I guess that would be a place that would anticipate, I'll get a question -- we'll get a question for that later on in this call, given it's so topical.But generally, we're continuing our direction with the investments that we've described over the past number of quarters, and we continue to make good progress. We continue to have good delivery. The ability to take role to markets in Europe is an example of that, how investments in that development and that technology has increased. And by the way, that's part of our broader strategy that we've touched on many times, is to take some of these developments and make sure that they're global in nature as opposed to only local in nature. So nothing incredibly new, just a continuation of the great work and the great projects we have underway.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.Mark Steven MarconLet me add my congratulations, particularly on the strong new bookings. Maria, you went through your 3 key strategic initiatives and all the subsections, of the various initiatives, which ones are going to be the most impactful do you think from a near-term perspective? And then one specific question. Within the mid-market, you mentioned not only deploying Next Gen payroll, but you also talked about the time engine. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that.Maria BlackSure. And thank you, Mark. I appreciate the congratulations. So I am very excited about the strategic priorities as I outlined during the prepared remarks. I don't know that I was necessarily expecting to have to pick a favorite pillar or a -- one that I expect to yield impact faster than another because I think broadly speaking, they apply across all of ADP, and they will depend a bit as it relates to kind of each business, right? And so when I think about some of the product investments that we're making, some of the things, the work that we've done and the impact, whether it's taking a product like Roll internationally, which I mentioned earlier, won't be in a short-term results, but some of the impact of continuing to build on the momentum we have in the mid-market with our Next Generation Payroll engine, as an example, where we have an ability to win differently, we see competitive advantages and differentiation there. I think that's an area that can have tremendous impact in short order.I think the other is, Don did it first, which is he mentioned the likes of generative AI. And when I think about that, the Gen AI and applying it broadly across these pillars, I think there is opportunity for us in product that's pretty tremendous, whether it's solving real opportunities for our clients to become more efficient. We've talked a lot about that, whether that's things like job descriptions, performance reviews, things of that nature.But it also leads me kind of to that second pillar to your point around what will come short term versus long term. I think there's opportunity in the short term that will make impact as well as the long term in terms of really applying generative AI across our expertise that we provide to our clients. And so when I think about our ability to make it easier for our clients to engage with us or our associates to engage with our clients, some of the tools that we have already deployed across various businesses and will further deploy into fiscal '24, such as -- think of it almost as a copilot agent assist where we're helping our agents be more efficient. That's going to yield short-term results if nothing else in client satisfaction. And again, we know happy clients lead to a longer staying clients that leads to more sales and the wheel if you will.So I think there are opportunities across all of the strategic priorities to have some impact us sooner than the long term. But yes, I'm equally excited about all of them. And certainly, we spoke quite a bit about the global piece.In terms of the next generation time engine, that is being developed in tandem with our Next Generation Payroll engine. And those 2 things are really about time and payroll sitting together in our mid-market. It is a based on the same backbone of technology.And so we're very excited to take that more broadly across the mid-market as we continue to take the Next Generation Payroll engine also more broadly crossed. And I think both of those things will get feathered into the impact of our win rates, if you will, and our new business bookings in the mid-market throughout the course of '24.Mark Steven MarconAnd then, Don, you mentioned the margin expectations for the full year. And you mentioned that in the first quarter, it's probably going to be a little bit lower and then feather up over the course of the year. How much lower during the first quarter? And what's the driver there? And then how should we think about the pacing of the improvement quarter-to-quarter?Don Edward McGuireYes, Mark, thanks for the question. The -- we're not looking at a big change in the first quarter, but just a couple of the drivers. Just to be clear. One, we do have some incremental investment in cost and headcount, et cetera. But the other big driver in the first quarter is it's a big borrowing quarter for us in our laddered client fund interest strategy. So that's going to put a little bit of pressure on the margin for the fourth -- sorry, for the first quarter. And the margin will continue to build over the course of the year, and we will get the overall improvement that we expected, but more out of the 3 quarters as opposed to the first.OperatorOur next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.Eugene M. SimuniI want to come back to the PEO for a second. So great to hear about strong PEO bookings in the fourth quarter and going into the new year. Can you provide a bit more color on what helped generate this reacceleration in bookings? I know you talked in the past, Maria, about some of the actions you guys have taken to generate PEO sales. I would love to hear what caused the acceleration in bookings? And are those initiatives that those kind of levers you're pulling now completely pulled or is it still work in progress and will continue into FY '24?Maria BlackSure, Eugene. PEO bookings, again, we're incredibly pleased with the results in the fourth quarter and the reacceleration. We also did see the reacceleration in the third quarter. So the back half of the PEO was exactly as you suggested. It was a lot of focus for the management team, and I'm really excited about how we came together to execute. And in terms of the overall demand trends in long term, short term, I remain bullish on the overall value proposition of the PEO and the demand that it warrants. It's hard in that business to kind of pin down the demand trends because there are so many variables. And in the PEO, it's not as simple as looking at just leads and number of request for proposals that are coming in, because as you know, not every client as a potential fits.So it's a little difficult to pin down kind of the various demand trends in the specificity outside of the overall belief in the demand environment. And there's normal level of kind of variability as it relates to PEO bookings quarter-to-quarter, which also makes it hard to kind of spot various trends. Some of that has to do with the calendar year-end, some of that has to do with when renewals happen. But nonetheless, there was a tremendous amount of focus and still remains. We remain very focused as a team across all of the leadership to make sure that we continue to drive the strong growth in bookings in the PEO in '24.Eugene M. SimuniGot it. Okay. And then for my follow-up, probably for Don. You talked about margin costs a little bit. So you expect another year of robust margin improvement next year, but obviously, you're not going to have as much tailwind in revenue growth as you had this year. And if you kind of do some of the (inaudible) math, it looks like your adjusted OpEx will need to grow slower next year than it did this year for you to hit your goal. So just hoping maybe you can talk a little bit what are the areas of spend where you will temper next year or maybe pull back, especially if macro conditions are not as good as kind of we expect them to be.Don Edward McGuireYes. So thanks for the question. Let me start by what won't change. So what won't change is that we'll continue to make sure that we invest in key areas of the business to make sure that we can run it effectively and with the strong bookings, we'll make sure that we have the people on the ground for implementation to get those deals up and running and generating revenue for us, et cetera.But in the last year, we did have pretty substantial growth in -- over the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic, I can't believe we're still talking about the pandemic but as we came up with that, we did have substantial growth in expenses, in service, implementation, sales, et cetera. And while we do continue to expect to see some growth, we're not going to see as much growth in expenses in those areas.So that would be one of the areas that is going to make sure and you hit on that with respect to OpEx, we're not going to see the growth in OpEx expense that we saw in the prior year.The other contributor, of course, that will continue to contribute, I think the yield curve is more favorable than it was the last time I spoke to you all. We will get contribution from client fund interest next year. But at the same time, it's not going to be to the extent that we did in '23. So that's also going to help with driving margins higher. But once again, not the same tailwind -- tailwinds that we had in '23. I think those are the main items that are going to help us improve our margins going into next year.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.Scott Darren WurtzelMaybe, Don, first on the cadence of revenue growth. I know you said it should be relatively stable throughout the year, but wondering if you can maybe sort of parse that out between ES and PEO if there's any differences we should think about there?Don Edward McGuireYes. So I think revenue growth is going to be -- revenue growth is going to be pretty consistent throughout the year as we start that big backlog that we now have as a result of that very, very strong fourth quarter bookings result. So we will see consistency there. Likewise with PEO, it's going to be a bit of a slower burn as we did have strong sales in Q4. So we did also talk about slightly lower pays per control growth in the PEO business. So -- but I don't think they're really going to be that different. I think they're going to be pretty close if you think about the overall growth and when you consolidate the results for the company, not substantially different between the business units.Danyal HussainYes, Scott, there is a slightly different cadence for the 2, it's not a huge difference. For PEO, we do expect an acceleration over the course of the year. So the contribution we get from our bookings and from the improvements in retention, we're expecting gradually overcoming slowing pays per control that should lead to an accelerating PEO revenue growth.And on ES, we're expecting some deceleration assuming pays per control decelerate and assuming the contribution from client funds interest starts to fade gradually over the course of the year. So you end up with 2 different-looking ramps, but they offset and that's what nets us to a very stable revenue growth overall.Scott Darren WurtzelGot it. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the Gen AI topic, going back to it. Obviously, there's a lot to sort of be excited about there. But just kind of wondering the magnitude of investment needed there, is that investment essentially all incremental to your investment plans for the year? Or have you had to maybe put some other projects on the back burner to focus a little more on Gen AI?Maria BlackYes and yes. And so said differently, the good news is we just went through our strategic plan process in the last 6 months. And so we had all of our priority sequence in all of our investments and incremental investments lined up. As we marry that to Gen AI, we have a very clear lens on where some projects may get enhanced, and where some projects may look different and perhaps get replaced by a new way of thinking about it. And so candidly speaking, we're going through a lot of these opportunities at this juncture kind of thinking through the bets and there will be incremental investment, and there will be other investments that we repurposed to go do some of these things in a new way. So the answer is both.OperatorOur next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi.Peter Corwin ChristiansenI'll also add to the congratulations ratio. Nice trends. Maria, a question on the international scaling effort here. I was just wondering if you -- in this context, if you could put some parameters on expected investment spend, I guess, over the next 1 to 2 years? And do you see M&amp;A as an important contributor to the growth algorithm there?Maria BlackSure. You started with a question on international. So is the rest of your question about international? Or is it just in general?Peter Corwin ChristiansenYes, international.Maria BlackAbout international. Yes. So we have been, over the years, been making in-country decisions on investments. I talked a lot about the, call it, the feet on the street, the final mile of infrastructure that we have to support our international business. And so we will continue to do that. That's inclusive of each year. We go into new markets and some of those are organic ways that we go into new markets. Some of those are actually partners that we ultimately end up at some point, call it, purchasing, if you will, or acquiring. And so the answer is both organic and inorganic. That's kind of how we've built the business over the last 20 years. And we will continue where warranted to think about it both ways. And the decision criteria for us is really about speed.A lot of times, it's our clients that pulled us into incremental markets. When I think about the 5 markets that we went into this year or the 2 countries that we're heading into with global view, they're byproduct of clients that are choosing to pay employees in certain markets. And as such, for us, a lot of times the decision we make on how to get there, has a lot to do with speed. And as such, again, we will leverage both organic and inorganic ways to get there. So I don't know -- Don, you ran our international business for a very long time, I don't know if you want to add anything.Don Edward McGuireYes, maybe just to add, I think what we've been doing, Peter, over the last number of years is we have done a number of acquisitions. They've been mostly tuck-ins, but we did have 3 interesting ones over the last year. We acquired an Italian company that has a good budget -- payroll budgeting software tool that's very prominent in the Italian market. We acquired our (inaudible) partner in South Africa, and we also bought a very exciting mid-market time-and-attendance product called SecureX in out of Bangalore and India. So -- and that product is available in India, most of Southeast Asia and the Middle East. So I think that's a demonstration of what we've been doing, we've been looking at and focused on to continue to make sure we grow that footprint, and we do think it continues to be an exciting space for us.Peter Corwin ChristiansenThat's great color. And Don, just as a follow-up, last slide on the maturation schedule of client fund investments, super helpful. But as we think about intra-year investment turnover, should that correlate with the seasonal balance levels that we typically see?Don Edward McGuireYes. So I think as those investments mature, you're going to see those investments reinvested at higher rates, and we do expect to see our average return go up over the course of the year. The current reinvestment schedules, overnights are reinvesting at 5%. The extended in the loan portfolios are being reinvested at about 4%. We don't expect to see a huge change in the mix although the average duration of our investments has shortened a little bit over the last couple of years, but you can pretty much look at those yields, look at the maturity schedule that we provided and then look at the composition of our portfolio across the overnight, the extended and the long and pretty much come to a conclusion or come to some numbers on where you think we're going to end up.Peter Corwin ChristiansenJust one quick one. How should we think about the duration strategy, I guess, for the next couple of quarters here, now that the Fed is perhaps kind of like stabilized, but are -- is there an effort to extend duration shortened? Just any sense there would be helpful.Don Edward McGuireYes. We've had this question a few times, and the answer is we've been very successful with the strategy that we've had for the last 20 years. We certainly see that there is an opportunity cost not ever having everything in short today. At the same time, we do believe that the yield curve will normalize and the strategy we've had in place will come back and be beneficial to us over the longer term. So you shouldn't expect any significant change in our investment strategy.OperatorOur next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.James Eugene FaucetteI wanted to go back quickly on retention. I know you've touched on it a little bit. Last year, your initial outlook called for around 50 -- minus 50 to minus 25 basis points of retention degradation. But that obviously didn't really play out. And this year, you're starting with a more conservative kind of minus 70 to minus 50. But I'm hoping you could speak to how much conservatism is embedded there? And what are the drivers that you're seeing as a reason to be a little bit more conservative to start than maybe you were last year even?Maria BlackYes, fair -- it's a fair observation, James. Appreciate it. I think the we thought about -- by the way, I wish I knew the answer, right? So the question you're asking, which is how much conservatism is in there? And that's all to say and you hit the nail on the head, we stepped into this year guiding minus 25 to 50, we're stepping into fiscal '24 with a guide of minus 50 to 70, and we hope -- I'll end -- or I'll start with, we're very happy with where things are. We're firing on all cylinders. We have many businesses that have record NS results, record retention results, and everything is good.And so as we step into the year, the way that we are modeling what you would see in pays per control. The way we're thinking about the potential macroeconomic tempering, if you will, specifically in the back half, is really a byproduct of how we see retention.Part of what we saw in the fourth quarter that led to the incredible results that we had was that the normalization that we've been seeing in the down market. We did actually see the down market bounce a little bit. So even while it was down year-on-year, it came in stronger than we expected. And so we do anticipate that we may need to give some of that back, which is why we believe it was prudent to align our retention targets to our medium-term targets that we gave back in the Investor Day of 2021.So I wish I knew the answer to your question in terms of how much conservatism, why we are guiding to what we're guiding is really about the economic outlook, whether that's GDP, unemployment is still at record lows. We haven't seen unemployment rates that low since the 60s. And so our guess is as good as yours at some level, but we did build in some tempering of the economy in the back half, and that's really what's yielding that guide on the retention.James Eugene FaucetteI appreciate that color, Maria. That's really helpful and makes a lot of sense. I want to turn quickly also to M&amp;A. You mentioned it in the prepared remarks, also, I mentioned it as part of at least some of your strategic initiatives. What are you seeing in terms of overall valuation levels? And what kind of things would you be targeting in terms of geography or product capabilities?Don Edward McGuireYes, James. So in terms of what we're targeting, what we're talking about, there's always things kicking around, of course, but we want to make sure that anything that we do acquire either fits well in the core and gives us additional capability, or it's something that really exceeds some functionality capability that we currently have, so that we're not stacking on more and more product on top of what we already have.The other area, of course, is to make sure that we do things that our natural adjacencies are very strong adjacencies to what we already do so that they fit well. And then thirdly, of course, is making sure that we can sell these things and run these things in a recurring model. So that we can sell them the way we sell everything else we sell today and operate them and expect to get revenue anticipation and good model from what we buy.So I think those are the things we think about. I think we're hearing a lot around valuations coming down in the press, certainly a little bit of a dearth of activity, if you will, in the M&amp;A space these days. But we do have lots of conversations about acquisitions and whatnot. I still think, of course, everybody is looking to get a premium what they have. And we're trying to make sure that if we're going to buy something, we're paying the right price. But we don't actually get to the point of many of these conversations given the conditions that I stated at the front at the outset to actually have a view on overall valuations in the market.We likely get to talking about valuation in a very, very few number of cases. Remembering, of course, very, very few of the opportunities we get even get to that conversation. So I don't think I can say we have a general view. But we are focused on what we would have to pay and how things would fit into ADP.OperatorOur last question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.Kartik MehtaMaria and Don, you've obviously talked a lot about the PEO and seems that the demand has really picked up. But I'm wondering, are you seeing any of your customers may be taking a little bit of a breather now pointing to sign up for the PEO because of the uncertainty in the economy and that being maybe more expensive product?Maria BlackThe PEO has a tremendous value proposition. I think we always refer to ADP as an all-weather company. I would say the most durable of our all-weather businesses is the PEO. And a lot of that has to do with the ability to flex that value proposition in a downturn pretty quickly. So if you think about clients that are growing, they enjoy the PEO because it's a quick go-to-market.On the downside, if you will, as clients are potentially trying to work through economic headwinds. The PEO serves as a place that has a clear return on investment, has a total cost of ownership that's very again, very clear. And so I think it's a business that not to suggest that it's not impacted by a downturn, but it's a business that kind of works in both. What I would say is our sales force, we're able to pivot that narrative and that value proposition as warranted. I don't believe that has happened.So to answer the question, our clients at this point, hesitant to purchase something such as the PEO that's so comprehensive because of the macroeconomic challenges. And my view would be no. I think that's substantiated by the record results that we had in the PEO bookings in the quarter. We also saw that strength in bookings in the third quarter. So I think that value proposition is holding firm. And I think it's a business that should -- should the economic wins ever come to life that we've been expecting for so long. It's a business that can pivot pretty quickly and the demand for the offer remains.Kartik MehtaAnd then just a follow-up. Don, you talked about obviously pays per control and retention, and maybe retention moderating as the year goes through. For pays per control, would you anticipate that just to get to flat by the end of the year? Or are you anticipating that, that could potentially go negative, and that's how you've built the guidance?Don Edward McGuireNo. We're certainly not anticipating this as go negative. We do, though, think it's going to go to somewhere the neighborhood 1% to 2%, which is a little bit less than our historical average. However, I just want to make sure that everybody understands, we're exiting the year pretty healthily. So we figure we're off to a pretty good start, but we do expect that we're going to see a bit of a decline over the next 3, 4 quarters. And once again, we're aligning ourselves to the best we can with unemployment forecasts and et cetera.Danyal HussainKartik, if you're asking specifically about where we're exiting fiscal '24, then the pays per control is effectively decelerating from this kind of 3% range to something flatter.OperatorThank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.Maria BlackThank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. As you've heard, Don and I, the entire leadership team, we're incredibly pleased with fiscal '23, specifically the fourth quarter and the finish.So I'll kind of end where I started, which is I want to take the opportunity to once again thank the associates that create this performance. It's an unbelievable magical thing to watch it all come together and deliver what we just delivered. And so my gratitude and I celebrate each and every one of them. I also want to thank all of the stakeholders, including all of you who listen today, appreciate the support. We're certainly excited for fiscal '24. So cheers to that.OperatorThank you for your participation. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Growth Stocks: 10 Aristocrats.Dividend investing is a specialized approach that yields rewards primarily for patient investors and may not suit everyone. When investing in dividend stocks, seasoned investors pay attention to growth in their payouts over the years. Through this, they aim to benefit through a combination of growing income stream, capital appreciation, and protection against inflation. Returns of dividend growth stocks have surpassed those without any growth tracks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned RMB Capital’s research which revealed that dividend growers achieved a positive return of 9.62% from 1972 until December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79% during the same period.According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers exhibited lower volatility over the last 50 years. Due to this, many financial experts are now recommending the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental part of equity portfolios for their clients. The consistent growth and stability of dividends make them an attractive option for investors seeking reliable long-term returns. From 1973 to 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return to shareholders, whereas dividend payers and dividend non-payers returned 9.18% and -0.60%, respectively. To learn more about dividend growth stocks, have a look at 12 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend Growth.Dividend aristocrat stocks are excellent choices for dividend growth investment due to their consistent and impressive track record of increasing dividends over an extended period. These S&amp;P 500 companies have raised their payouts for 25 years or more and have stable cash flows which highlights their ability to increase dividends in the future as well. Last year’s inflation affected almost every sector, but dividend aristocrats performed better than most other types of investments. Though the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index also ended the year with losses, it still managed to outperform the S&amp;P 500, which recorded its worst performance since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

may not crossfoot to the total Change (%) due to rounding.(2)   Organic growth is the change in revenues which includes SOP (sorted office paper) pricing and volume and excludes the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange.(3)   The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period’s foreign exchange rates. Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency.  RECONCILIATION OF U.S. GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED)Table 2-A: THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 and 2022(In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Gross Profit Selling,General and AdministrativeExpenses (Loss) Income from Operations Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders c Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$251.1 $220.9  $(24.0) $(49.5) $(0.54)Adjustments:         ERP and System Modernization 1 —  (5.4)  5.4   4.1   0.04 Intangible Amortization 2 —  (28.1)  28.1   21.8   0.24 Portfolio Optimization 3 —  —   54.2   53.8   0.58 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance 4 —  (8.9)  8.9   6.7   0.07 Asset Impairments 5 3.4  —   3.4   3.4   0.04 Total Adjustments 3.4  (42.4)  100.0   89.8   0.97 Adjusted Financial Measures a $254.5 $178.5  $76.0  $40.3  $0.43 Depreciation     26.0     Adjusted EBITDA b    $102.0      (In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Gross Profit Selling,General and AdministrativeExpenses Income from Operations Net IncomeAttributable to Common Shareholders c Diluted Earnings Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$260.5 $222.4  $38.1 $10.5 $0.11Adjustments:         ERP and System Modernization 1 —  (3.5)  3.5  2.6  0.03Intangible Amortization 2 —  (30.8)  30.8  23.9  0.26Portfolio Optimization 3 —  —   —  —  —Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance 4 —  (9.6)  9.6  7.1  0.08Asset Impairments 5 —  —   —  —  —Total Adjustments —  (43.9)  43.9  33.6  0.37Adjusted Financial Measures a$260.5 $178.5  $82.0 $44.1 $0.48Depreciation     27.0    Adjusted EBITDA b    $109.0     (In millions, except per share data) Second Quarter 2023 Change Compared to Second Quarter 2022 Gross Profit Selling,General and Administrative Expenses (Loss) Income from Operations Net (Loss) IncomeAttributable to Common Shareholders  Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$(9.4) $(1.5) $(62.1) $(60.0) $(0.65)Adjustments:         ERP and System Modernization —   (1.9)  1.9   1.5   0.01 Intangible Amortization —   2.7   (2.7)  (2.1)  (0.02)Portfolio Optimization —   —   54.2   53.8   0.58 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance —   0.7   (0.7)  (0.4)  (0.01)Asset Impairments 3.4   —   3.4   3.4   0.04 Total Adjustments 3.4   1.5   56.1   56.2   0.60 Adjusted Financial Measures$(6.0) $—  $(6.0) $(3.8) $(0.05)Depreciation     (1.0)    Adjusted EBITDA    $(7.0)     The following table provides adjustments to Income from operations categorized as follows:(In millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022Non-Cash Related 6$83.8 $30.8Cash Related 16.2  13.1Total$100.0 $43.9 Non-cash related adjustments include the following:(In millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Depreciation and Impairments of Property, Plant and Equipment Amortization of Intangibles Divestiture Losses (Gains), net TotalAdjustments:       Intangible Amortization2$— $28.1 $— $28.1Portfolio Optimization3 —  —  52.3  52.3Asset Impairments5 3.4  —  —  3.4Total Non-Cash Charges$3.4 $28.1 $52.3 $83.8 (In millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Depreciation and Impairments of Property, Plant and Equipment Amortization of Intangibles Divestiture Losses (Gains), net TotalAdjustments:       Intangible Amortization2$— $30.8 $— $30.8Total Non-Cash Charges$— $30.8 $— $30.8U.S. GAAP results for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 include: ERP and System Modernization: In 2023 and 2022, Selling, General, and Administrative expenses (“SG&amp;A”) includes consulting and professional fees related to our ERP and system modernization.Intangible Amortization: Intangible amortization expense from acquisitions.Portfolio Optimization: In 2023, Divestitures losses, net includes aggregate net losses of $54.2 million (inclusive of $1.9 million related to deal costs) related to International divestitures of Brazil, Republic of Korea, Australia, Singapore, and other businesses.Litigation, Settlements, and Regulatory Compliance: In 2023 and 2022, SG&amp;A includes $5.2 million (which includes FCPA monitor related fees of $2.4 million) and $3.5 million, respectively, of primarily consulting and professional fees and estimated contingent liability provisions related to certain litigation, settlement and regulatory compliance matters. Additionally in 2023, SG&amp;A includes a settlement charge associated with a vendor dispute of $4.0 million, other settlement charges of $0.6 million, and a FCPA settlement release of $0.9 million. Additionally in 2022, SG&amp;A includes a $3.5 million settlement charge related to a multi-year indirect tax related Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) examination and FCPA settlement expense of $0.4 million.Asset Impairments: In 2023, Cost of Revenues (“COR”) includes an impairment of $3.4 million in International associated with certain long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, in Romania.Non-Cash Related Adjustments: In 2023 and 2022, non-cash related adjustments include $83.8 million and $30.8 million, respectively, consisting of intangible amortization, portfolio optimization, and asset impairment items.The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of Stericycle’s performance because they provide additional information about Stericycle’s operations and exclude certain adjusting items, allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release may not be calculated in the same manner as certain other Non-GAAP financial measures and are used solely to evaluate management’s performance for incentive compensation purposes. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies.Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is (Loss) income from operations excluding certain adjusting items, depreciation and intangible amortization.Under the Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $10.2 million and $10.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, based on applying the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis. For purposes of reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share with respect to taxes period-over-period, the company utilizes a “rate approach” to highlight the impact of the adjusted tax rate. It is computed by multiplying the prior period adjusted rate by the current period adjusted income before taxes to determine the expected tax expense. Such expected tax expense is then compared to actual tax expense. Expected tax in excess of actual tax variance is favorable; actual tax in excess of expected tax variance is unfavorable. The variance divided by diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period yields the impact on earnings per share. Management believes the use of this measure best aids in explaining the impact of a changing tax rate. Table 2-B: SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 and 2022 (In millions, except per share data)  Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Gross Profit Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Income from Operations Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders c Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$512.1 $436.9  $16.0 $(38.3) $(0.41)Adjustments:         ERP and System Modernization 1 —  (8.1)  8.1  6.1   0.07 Intangible Amortization 2 —  (56.3)  56.3  43.7   0.47 Portfolio Optimization 3 —  (0.6)  59.8  59.1   0.64 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance 4 —  (17.1)  17.1  11.5   0.12 Asset Impairments 5 3.4  —   3.4  3.4   0.04 Total Adjustments 3.4  (82.1)  144.7  123.8   1.34 Adjusted Financial Measures a$515.5 $354.8  $160.7 $85.5  $0.93 Depreciation     52.6    Adjusted EBITDA b    $213.3     (In millions, except per share data) Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Gross Profit Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Income from Operations Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders c Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$505.0 $461.0  $44.0 $(3.8) $(0.04)Adjustments:         ERP and System Modernization 1 —  (9.1)  9.1  6.8   0.07 Intangible Amortization 2 —  (63.2)  63.2  49.1   0.53 Portfolio Optimization 3 —  (1.3)  1.3  1.0   0.01 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance 4 —  (23.4)  23.4  20.0   0.22 Asset Impairments 5 —  —   —  —   — Total Adjustments —  (97.0)  97.0  76.9   0.83 Adjusted Financial Measures a$505.0 $364.0  $141.0 $73.1  $0.79 Depreciation     54.3    Adjusted EBITDA b    $195.3     (In millions, except per share data) Year-to-Date 2023 Change Compared to 2022 Gross Profit Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Income from Operations Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders  Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures$7.1 $(24.1) $(28.0) $(34.5) $(0.37)Adjustments:         ERP and System Modernization —  1.0   (1.0)  (0.7)  — Intangible Amortization —  6.9   (6.9)  (5.4)  (0.06)Portfolio Optimization —  0.7   58.5   58.1   0.63 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance —  6.3   (6.3)  (8.5)  (0.10)Asset Impairments 3.4  —   3.4   3.4   0.04 Total Adjustments 3.4  14.9   47.7   46.9   0.51 Adjusted Financial Measures$10.5 $(9.2) $19.7  $12.4  $0.14 Depreciation     (1.7)    Adjusted EBITDA    $18.0      The following table provides adjustments to Income from operations categorized as follows:(In millions) Six Months Ended June 30,  2023  2022Non-Cash Related6$116.9 $63.2Cash Related 27.8  33.8Total$144.7 $97.0 Non-cash related adjustments include the following:(In millions) Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Depreciation and Impairments of Property, Plant and Equipment Amortization of Intangibles Divestiture Losses (Gains), net TotalAdjustments:       Intangible Amortization 2$— $56.3  — $56.3Portfolio Optimization3 —  —  57.2  57.2Asset Impairments 5 3.4  —  —  3.4Total Non-Cash Charges$3.4 $56.3 $57.2 $116.9 (In millions) Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Depreciation and Impairments of Property, Plant and Equipment Amortization of Intangibles Divestiture Losses (Gains), net TotalAdjustments:       Intangible Amortization 2$— $63.2  — $63.2Total Non-Cash Charges$— $63.2 $— $63.2U.S. GAAP results for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 include:ERP and System Modernization: In 2023 and 2022, SG&amp;A includes consulting and professional fees related to our ERP and system modernization.Intangible Amortization: Intangible amortization expense from acquisitions.Portfolio Optimization: In 2023 Divestitures losses, net includes aggregate net losses of $59.2 million (inclusive of $2.0 million related to deal costs) related to International divestitures of Brazil, Republic of Korea, Australia, Singapore, a container manufacturing operation, and other businesses.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $58.50 indicates a potential upside of 25.4%.The average comprises four short-term price targets ranging from a low of $45 to a high of $70, with a standard deviation of $11.56. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 3.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 50.1% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for SRCL, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why SRCL Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, SRCL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much SRCL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This piece explores five publicly traded REITs with impressive dividend yields, providing insights for potential REIT investors looking to expand their portfolios.SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG)SL Green Realty Corp specializes in acquiring, managing, and maximizing the value of Manhattan commercial real estate. By exploiting the potential of these premium properties, the company creates robust revenue streams.In terms of dividends, SLG pays a monthly dividend with an 8.97% yield. Despite lowering its dividend from $0.3108 to $0.2708 per share last year, the firm has now achieved a healthy Funds From Operations (FFO) payout ratio of 59%, contributing to stable dividend income for shareholders.Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. (NYSE:BXMT)Venturing into the mortgage REIT sector, we find Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc., a company that originates senior loans collateralized by commercial properties across North America, Europe, and Australia.The firm’s dividend yield stands at 10.97%, with a payout ratio of 81.58%. Despite a $0.42 per share dividend cut in 2020, the dividend has since rebounded, seeing a growth of over 20%.Check out:Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE:MPW)Medical Properties Trust is a unique player in the REIT sector, focusing on the acquisition and development of net-leased hospital facilities. With a portfolio that extends across ten countries and four continents, the company boasts an impressive 11.09% dividend yield and a 74.8% FFO payout ratio.Story continuesIt also shows a steady 5-year dividend growth rate of 3.43%, painting a promising picture of the trust’s dividend history.Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (NYSE:IIPR)Innovative Industrial Properties is an exciting player in the niche market of regulated cannabis facilities. The profitability of this sector, coupled with the firm’s focus on acquisition, ownership, and management of specialized properties, contributes to a substantial dividend yield of 9.09%.The REIT’s dividend growth is nothing short of impressive, with a 5-year growth rate of 5.57%. However, some investors may be nervous about the company's high FFO payout ratio of 89%.AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC)AGNC Investment Corp operates as a mortgage REIT, investing primarily in residential mortgage securities with government-guaranteed principal and interest payments. Despite the challenges posed by a high interest rate environment, the company’s dividend yield stands strong at 14.04%, with a manageable payout ratio of 46.3%. However, its 5-year dividend growth rate is at -17.21%, indicative of the inherent risks in the mortgage REITs space.For investors seeking a steady stream of income, these five REITs offer enticing dividend yields. From commercial real estate stalwarts like SL Green Realty Corp to niche market pioneers like Innovative Industrial Properties, the diversity in the REIT sector caters to a wide range of investment tastes. However, it’s essential for investors to conduct further research, considering factors beyond just yield, such as payout ratio and dividend growth rate, to find the best fit for their financial goals.

536,6af5c7b0-0b84-3e30-b7fd-45b6eeb675bb,SLG,2023-07-27,REIT Downgrades Increase: Are Analysts Trying To Warn Investors?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reit-downgrades-increase-analysts-trying-123712644.html,1690288632.0,STORY,"['SLG', 'TGT', 'EQIX', 'ABR', 'ESS', 'PCH', 'EPR', 'UMH']","[When it comes to upgrades, downgrades or changes in price targets, despite their potential to influence markets significantly, the overall predictions of analysts tend to be accurate only about 50% of the time. And that means that just as often, they can be flat-out wrong.One noteworthy example this year occurred on March 28, when Citigroup maintained its previous downgrade to Sell on SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) and slashed its price target from $36 to $17. SL Green had already touched a low of $18.21 two trading days prior to Citigroup's announcement, and Citigroup was expecting even more downside.But contrary to Citigroup's prediction, the stock began to rise and has continued to rally for months with its most recent closing price at $35.10.One of the differences between Citigroup's call on SL Green and a slew of other recent downgrades is that SL Green had been falling in price for months when the new price target was announced. The reason for the erroneous prediction was that it was late, whereas recent downgrades on real estate investment trusts (REITs) are coming after these issues have been rallying for weeks.From July 10-17, only three REITs were downgraded. But this past week from July 18-24, there were nine. Perhaps analysts are trying to warn investors that with the bulk of REIT earnings reports coming in soon and the recent rally getting long in the tooth, the downside risk is now greater than the potential reward of beating earnings. The prolonged rally may have already priced in positive expectations and share prices have limited upside at this point.Another concern about these recent downgrades is that they're not focused on one subsector of the REIT market such as office REITs, but instead, they encompass a wide range of subsectors. The recent downgrades are in hotel, residential, specialty, mortgage, retail and healthcare REITs.On July 20, analyst Tylor Batory of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. downgraded not just one, but four hotel REITs from Outperform to Perform: Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:BHR), Chatham Lodging Trust (NYSE:CLDT), Hersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE:HT) and RLJ Lodging Trust (NYSE:RLJ). Two weeks earlier, Batory maintained Outperform ratings on all four.Story continuesCheck out:This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities. Here's how you can be among the first to buy shares.Hotel REITs are not the only subsector falling out of favor with analysts. Take a look at some other REITs with huge rallies over the past few months that have been downgraded over the past week.Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR): On July 24, J.P. Morgan analyst Richard Shane downgraded mortgage REIT (mREIT) Arbor Realty Trust from Neutral to Underweight but raised the price target from $11.50 to $13.50. Arbor Realty has rallied from an April low of $9.77 to its recent closing price of $16.54.Equinix Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX): On July 21, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Eric Luebchow downgraded specialty REIT Equinix from Overweight to Equal-Weight and maintained the present price target at $810. Equinix rallied from $656 in March to $807 in July.Independence Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:IRT): On July 18, BMO Capital Markets analyst John Kim downgraded residential REIT Independence Realty Trust from Market Perform to Outperform and announced a price target of $19. Independence rallied from $14.29 in March to $17.69 in July.Essex Property Trust Inc. (NYSE:ESS): On July 18, Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak downgraded residential REIT Essex Property Trust from Buy to Hold but raised the price target from $245 to $250. Essex Property rallied from $191 in March to $245 in July.PotlatchDeltic Corp. (NASDAQ:PCH): On July 19, RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Quinn downgraded specialty REIT PotlatchDeltic Corp. from Outperform to Sector Perform and announced a $55 price target. Quinn said that with PotlatchDeltic's share price rising 23% in recent weeks, he sees limited upside from here.Three other REITs were also downgraded in the previous week. All of them had produced significant rallies since bottoming in March:Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL): On July 14, Evercore ISI Group analyst Steve Sakwa downgraded healthcare REIT Welltower from Outperform to In-Line and lowered the price target from $82 to $81.EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR): On July 14, Raymond James analyst RJ Milligan downgraded specialty REIT EPR Properties and announced a $50 price target.UMH Properties Inc. (NYSE:UMH): On July 12, Wolfe Research analyst Keegan Carl downgraded UMH Properties from Outperform to Peer Perform.How should investors react to these downgrades? While downgrades are certainly concerning, investors are cautioned to perform their own due diligence before purchasing or selling stocks and not to simply rely upon analysts' upgrades or downgrades to make investment decisions.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

The value of the seed portfolio is based on a low-5% effective forward yield.Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire six communities totaling 1,753 apartment homes in exchange for $172.5 million of UDR Operating Partnership Units issued at $47.50 per unit, $20.0 million in cash, and the assumption of $209.4 million of below market debt at a weighted average coupon rate of 3.8 percent with a weighted average of 6.3 years to maturity.

""In-place controllable operating margins across these communities are approximately 800 basis points on average below UDR communities in the same markets, illustrating the potential to drive future upside after integrating UDR’s industry-leading operating platform.""Due to the low initial margins at the acquired communities relative to the average margin across UDR’s portfolio, the transaction is expected to be cash flow neutral in year 1 and accretive in year 2 as UDR initiatives are implemented. The transaction is expected to be slightly dilutive to FFOA per share in year 1 due to negative non-cash debt mark-to-market adjustments related to the significantly below-market-rate debt being assumed.Development Activity and Other ProjectsDuring the quarter, the Company achieved stabilization at Cirrus, a $101.9 million, 292-home apartment community the Company developed in Denver, CO.At the end of the second quarter, the Company’s development pipeline totaled $187.5 million and was 58 percent funded. The Company’s active development pipeline includes two communities, one each in the Addison submarket of Dallas, TX, and Tampa, FL, for a combined total of 415 apartment homes.At the end of the second quarter, the Company’s redevelopment pipeline of 2,343 apartment homes, which includes a densification project that features the addition of 30 new apartment homes at one community, totaled $124.7 million and was 34 percent funded.Developer Capital Program (""DCP"") PortfolioDuring the quarter, the Company funded a total of $38.8 million to pay down and extend the maturity dates of the senior construction loans affiliated with investments in 1300 Fairmount, Modera Lake Merritt, and Junction, which have a weighted average occupancy of 91 percent. The funded amounts will earn a projected initial contractual weighted average return rate of 9.4 percent, including a 9.5 percent return rate on 1300 Fairmount (8.5 percent prior), which could increase to 10.5 percent, or a projected contractual weighted average return rate of 9.9 percent at that time, if the developer exercises its option to extend the maturity date of the Company’s loan.At the end of the second quarter, the Company’s commitments under its DCP platform totaled $520.9 million with a contractual weighted average return rate of 9.8 percent and a weighted average estimated remaining term of 3.0 years.Capital Markets and Balance Sheet Activity""Our investment grade balance sheet continues to improve, with net Debt-to-EBITDAre of 5.5x, which was lower by 0.7x versus a year ago,"" said Joe Fisher, UDR’s President and Chief Financial Officer. ""With minimal committed forward funding obligations, strong next 3-year liquidity, and our ability to source capital through joint venture and OP unit transactions, we can continue to opportunistically grow the Company and enhance stakeholder returns.""The Company’s total indebtedness as of June 30, 2023 was $5.4 billion with no remaining consolidated maturities until 2024, excluding principal amortization and amounts on the Company’s commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $1.1 billion of liquidity through a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on its credit facilities. Please see Attachment 14 of the Company’s related quarterly Supplement for additional details on projected capital sources and uses.In the table below, the Company has presented select balance sheet metrics for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and the comparable prior year period.Quarter Ended June 30Balance Sheet Metric2Q 20232Q 2022ChangeWeighted Average Interest Rate3.21%2.85%0.36%Weighted Average Years to Maturity(1)6.37.1(0.8)Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio5.0x5.4x(0.4)xConsolidated Debt as a percentage of Total Assets31.9%33.6%(1.7)%Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre5.5x6.2x(0.7)x(1)If the Company’s commercial paper balance was refinanced using its line of credit, the weighted average years to maturity would have been 6.4 years with and without extensions for 2Q 2023 and 7.3 years without extensions and 7.4 years with extensions for 2Q 2022.DividendAs previously announced, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on its common stock for the second quarter 2023 in the amount of $0.42 per share. The dividend will be paid in cash on July 31, 2023 to UDR common shareholders of record as of July 10, 2023.

AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. Management believes that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, and presenting AFFO enables investors to assess our performance in comparison to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not always be comparable to AFFO calculated by other REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. A reconciliation from net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders to AFFO is provided on Attachment 2.Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items as Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items divided by total consolidated interest, excluding the impact of costs associated with debt extinguishment, plus preferred dividends.Management considers Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lenders with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items as Consolidated EBITDAre – adjusted for non-recurring items divided by total consolidated interest, excluding the impact of costs associated with debt extinguishment.Management considers Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lenders with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items as total consolidated debt net of cash and cash equivalents divided by annualized Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items. Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items is defined as EBITDAre excluding the impact of income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities, adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures and other non-recurring items including, but not limited to casualty-related charges/(recoveries), net of wholly owned communities.Management considers Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lenders with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its consolidated debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and Consolidated EBITDAre - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Controllable Expenses: The Company refers to property operating and maintenance expenses as Controllable Expenses.Controllable Operating Margin: The Company defines Controllable Operating Margin as (i) rental income less Controllable Expenses (ii) divided by rental income. Management considers Controllable Operating Margin a useful metric as it provides investors with an indicator of the Company’s ability to limit the growth of expenses that are within the control of the Company.Development Communities: The Company defines Development Communities as those communities recently developed or under development by the Company, that are currently majority owned by the Company and have not achieved stabilization as of the most recent quarter.Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre): The Company defines EBITDAre as net income/(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), plus interest expense, including costs associated with debt extinguishment, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, plus other depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) income tax provision/(benefit), net, (minus) plus net gain/(loss) on the sale of depreciable real estate owned, plus impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus the adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the Nareit definition, or that interpret the Nareit definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre was approved by the Board of Governors of Nareit in September 2017.Management considers EBITDAre a useful metric for investors as it provides an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt, and enables investors to assess our performance against that of its peer REITs. EBITDAre should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company’s activities in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAre does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and EBITDAre is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth as the combined proportional growth as a result of Effective New Lease Rate Growth and Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth. Management considers Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses combined proportional market-level, new and in-place demand trends.Effective New Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines Effective New Lease Rate Growth as the increase in gross potential rent realized less concessions for the new lease term (current effective rent) versus prior resident effective rent for the prior lease term on new leases commenced during the current quarter.Management considers Effective New Lease Rate Growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses market-level new demand trends.Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth: The Company defines Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth as the increase in gross potential rent realized less concessions for the new lease term (current effective rent) versus prior effective rent for the prior lease term on renewed leases commenced during the current quarter.Management considers Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth a useful metric for investors as it assesses market-level, in-place demand trends.Estimated Quarter of Completion: The Company defines Estimated Quarter of Completion of a development or redevelopment project as the date on which construction is expected to be completed, but it does not represent the date of stabilization.Attachment 15(B)Definitions and ReconciliationsJune 30, 2023(Unaudited)Funds from Operations as Adjusted (""FFO as Adjusted"") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders: The Company defines FFO as Adjusted attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as FFO excluding the impact of other non-comparable items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related costs, prepayment costs/benefits associated with early debt retirement, impairment write-downs or gains and losses on sales of real estate or other assets incidental to the main business of the Company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses, casualty-related expenses and recoveries, severance costs and legal and other costs.Management believes that FFO as Adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other REITs. FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. A reconciliation from net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO as Adjusted is provided on Attachment 2.Funds from Operations (""FFO"") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders: The Company defines FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the Company or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are directly attributable to decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the Company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and the Company’s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust's definition issued in April 2002 and restated in November 2018. In the computation of diluted FFO, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, unvested LTIP Units, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.Management considers FFO a useful metric for investors as the Company uses FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company's activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation from net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO is provided on Attachment 2.Held For Disposition Communities: The Company defines Held for Disposition Communities as those communities that were held for sale as of the end of the most recent quarter.Joint Venture Reconciliation at UDR's weighted average ownership interest:In thousands2Q 2023YTD 2023Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities$9,697$19,404Management fee6151,225Interest expense4,1188,149Depreciation7,58015,065General and administrative61121Developer Capital Program (excludes loans)(11,681)(21,803)Other (income)/expense70158Realized (gain)/loss on real estate technology investments, net of tax200720Unrealized (gain)/loss on real estate technology investments, net of tax616(839)Total Joint Venture NOI at UDR's Ownership Interest$11,276$22,200Net Operating Income (""NOI""): The Company defines NOI as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent and other revenues less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense, which is calculated as 3.25% of property revenue, and land rent. Property management expense covers costs directly related to consolidated property operations, inclusive of corporate management, regional supervision, accounting and other costs.Management considers NOI a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization and is a widely used input, along with capitalization rates, in the determination of real estate valuations.

Management considers Other Markets a useful metric as the operating results for the individual markets are not representative of the fundamentals for those markets as a whole.Physical Occupancy: The Company defines Physical Occupancy as the number of occupied homes divided by the total homes available at a community.QTD Same-Store Communities: The Company defines QTD Same-Store Communities as those communities Stabilized for five full consecutive quarters. These communities were owned and had stabilized operating expenses as of the beginning of the quarter in the prior year, were not in process of any substantial redevelopment activities, and were not held for disposition.Recurring Capital Expenditures: The Company defines Recurring Capital Expenditures as expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at its communities.Redevelopment Communities: The Company generally defines Redevelopment Communities as those communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress. Based upon the level of material impact the redevelopment has on the community (operations, occupancy levels, and future rental rates), the community may or may not maintain Stabilization. As such, for each redevelopment, the Company assesses whether the community remains in Same-Store.Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis: Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental income on a straight-line basis which allows investors to evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by its peer REITs. In addition, Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis allows an investor to understand the historical trends in cash concessions.A reconciliation between Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis to Same-Store Revenue on a straight-line basis (inclusive of the impact to Same-Store NOI) is provided below:2Q 232Q 222Q 231Q 23YTD 23YTD 22Revenue (Cash basis)$374,534$350,260$374,534$370,099$744,633$692,399Concessions granted/(amortized), net(201)(2,338)(201)60(142)(6,853)Revenue (Straight-line basis)$374,333$347,922$374,333$370,159$744,491$685,546% change - Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash basis:6.9%1.2%7.5%% change - Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Straight-line basis:7.6%1.1%8.6%% change - Same-Store NOI with Concessions on a Cash basis:6.7%0.6%8.1%% change - Same-Store NOI with Concessions on a Straight-line basis:7.7%0.5%9.6%Sold Communities: The Company defines Sold Communities as those communities that were disposed of prior to the end of the most recent quarter.Stabilization/Stabilized: The Company defines Stabilization/Stabilized as when a community’s occupancy reaches 90% or above for at least three consecutive months.Stabilized, Non-Mature Communities: The Company defines Stabilized, Non-Mature Communities as those communities that have reached Stabilization but are not yet in the same-store portfolio.Total Revenue per Occupied Home: The Company defines Total Revenue per Occupied Home as rental and other revenues with concessions reported on a Cash Basis, divided by the product of occupancy and the number of apartment homes. A reconciliation between Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis to Same-Store Revenue on a straight-line basis is provided above.Management considers Total Revenue per Occupied Home a useful metric for investors as it serves as a proxy for portfolio quality, both geographic and physical.TRS: The Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries (""TRS"") focus on making investments and providing services that are otherwise not allowed to be made or provided by a REIT.YTD Same-Store Communities: The Company defines YTD Same-Store Communities as those communities Stabilized for two full consecutive calendar years.

539,6050a3b6-3cf5-391d-996c-ad6be8ecdc9d,VNO,2023-07-27,What's in the Offing for Vornado (VNO) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-offing-vornado-vno-earnings-122000053.html,1690374000,STORY,"['VNO', 'CWK']","[Vornado Realty Trust VNO is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 31, after market close. The quarterly results are likely to reflect a year-over-year decline in revenue and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) FFO plus assumed conversions as adjusted per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.23%. Although the quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues aided by healthy leasing activity, higher operating expenses acted as a dampener.Over the trailing four quarters, Vornado’s FFO plus assumed conversions as adjusted per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 4.69%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS SurpriseVornado Realty Trust price-eps-surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteFactors at PlayPer a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, while demand for select premium office spaces continues to outperform the broader market, the overall recovery in the U.S. office market demand remains choppy, with recession fears lingering amongst occupiers.The pace of job growth has been slower than in early 2022, and the rate of deceleration for office-using employment is higher. Amid this, the second quarter recorded a negative net absorption of 26.9 million square feet (msf), marking the lowest quarter in two years.The overall gross leasing activity for the four quarters ending second-quarter 2023 was 289 msf. Further, leasing activity in the quarter slumped 24% year over year. While leasing slid for four straight quarters, it was still 49 msf (20%) above the pandemic-era low witnessed in the first quarter of 2021.The Cushman &amp; Wakefield report also highlights greater availability of sublease space (2.9% of the total inventory, almost three times the pre-pandemic norm of around 1%) as a key concern for this sector. The second-quarter national vacancy rate rose 70 basis points to 19.2%, reflecting the largest quarter-over-quarter increase since mid-2021. The national asking rent came in at $37.34 for the quarter.   As for Vornado, its premium, newly-developed properties are likely to have witnessed healthy demand during the quarter. In June 2023, the company signed a lease agreement with the United States’ premier healthy lifestyle brand — Life Time — for more than 53,000 square feet on the first three floors of its PENN 1 property adjacent to Madison Square Garden in New York City.However, given the choppy-office market environment, we anticipate that leasing volume for some of Vornado’s properties, especially the older constructed ones with fewer amenities, may not have reached its full potential.Additionally, limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty might have curtailed the company’s Manhattan street retail’s performance to some extent during the second quarter.These factors are expected to have impaired Vornado’s top-line growth, hurting its quarterly earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $440.3 million, suggesting a fall of 2.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for Vornado’s New York revenues stands at $354.5 million, indicating a 2.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Further, in April 2023, expecting reduced projected 2023 taxable income due to higher interest expenses, VNO postponed its dividend payment until the end of this year. At the end of 2023, depending upon its taxable income for the year, the company will pay the dividend in either cash or a combination of cash and securities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised 1.6% northward to 64 cents over the past week. The figure, however, suggests a 24.1% decline from the prior-year period’s reported number.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for VNO this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Vornado has an Earnings ESP of -2.94%.

(NYSE:DHI) Now?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-d-r-horton-110025670.html,1690455625,STORY,['DHI'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on D.R. Horton’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton What's The Opportunity In D.R. Horton?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that D.R. Horton’s ratio of 8.94x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 8.94x, which means if you buy D.R. Horton today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe D.R. Horton should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because D.R. Horton’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will D.R. Horton generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of D.R. Horton, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.2%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? DHI’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at DHI? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DHI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

554,11c68fd1-c2fe-3ba9-a3f9-962eb1573b1e,AFL,2023-07-27,What's in the Cards for American International's (AIG) Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-american-internationals-aig-175200515.html,1690393920,STORY,"['AIG', 'AFL']","[American International Group, Inc. AIG is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, after the market close.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American International’s second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.54, which indicates an improvement of 29.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $12,284 million, suggesting 12.7% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Earnings Surprise HistoryAmerican International’s bottom line beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 9.22%. This is depicted in the chart below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteIn the second quarter, revenues of AIG are likely to have benefited on the back of strong contributions from higher premium income and net investment income. While premiums are likely to have received a boost on the back of solid commercial and personal lines businesses, net investment income is expected to have gained from improved returns from fixed maturities and loans.We expect premium income of American International to be $7,869.1 million, which implies a 4.8% rise year over year. Our estimate for net investment income stands at $2,627.8 million, suggesting 0.9% growth year over year.Strong contributions from the General Insurance and, Life and Retirement segments are expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The General Insurance unit is likely to have been aided by strength in commercial business resulting from rate increases, higher retention rates and new business growth. We anticipate net premiums written of the General Insurance segment to be $7,286.6 million, suggesting 6.1% growth year over year. Growing earned premiums and an improved combined ratio are expected to have boosted the underwriting results of the unit in the second quarter. Our estimate for its underwriting income indicates a surge of 38.9% year over year. Meanwhile, we project the General Insurance’s adjusted pretax income to be $1,561.8 million, implying 24.3% growth year over year.Story continuesThe Life and Retirement business of AIG is likely to have received an impetus from growing premiums and deposits in the to-be-reported quarter, which in turn, are expected to have stemmed from increased fixed annuity and fixed index annuity product sales. Our estimate for adjusted revenues in the segment is pegged at $4,566.5 million, suggesting 13.1% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.However, reduced alternative investment income and lower fee income are expected to have been a roadblock for the Life and Retirement unit in the second quarter. We expect adjusted pretax income of the segment to be $626.2 million, which indicates a decline of 16.2% year over year.Despite numerous cost-cutting initiatives and favorable mortality experience, the bottom line of American International is likely to have suffered a blow due to an elevated expense base related to policyholder benefits and losses incurred plus general operating and other expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.

When investing in dividend stocks, seasoned investors pay attention to growth in their payouts over the years. Through this, they aim to benefit through a combination of growing income stream, capital appreciation, and protection against inflation. Returns of dividend growth stocks have surpassed those without any growth tracks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned RMB Capital’s research which revealed that dividend growers achieved a positive return of 9.62% from 1972 until December 31, 2018. In contrast, dividend cutters experienced a negative return of 0.79% during the same period.According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers exhibited lower volatility over the last 50 years. Due to this, many financial experts are now recommending the inclusion of dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental part of equity portfolios for their clients. The consistent growth and stability of dividends make them an attractive option for investors seeking reliable long-term returns. From 1973 to 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return to shareholders, whereas dividend payers and dividend non-payers returned 9.18% and -0.60%, respectively.

Meanwhile, the retail stores offer unique gifts and self-indulgences.The stock has struggled all year and is trading close to recent lows as earnings disappoint and analyst estimates continue to move lower.While the dividend is attractive, investors might want to shop elsewhere for their next investment. About the CompanyCracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and is headquartered in Lebanon, TN.The company operates over 660 stores and employs over 73,000 people.CBRL is valued at $2 billion and has a Forward PE of 17. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “B” in Momentum, but “C” in both Growth and Value. The stock pays a healthy dividend of 5.5%Q3 EarningsCracker Barrel last reported earnings in early June, missing expectations by 9%. This was the second miss over the last three quarters, which has kept the stock from going higher in a strong year for the stock market.Looking closer at the quarter, the company reported Q3 at $1.21, below the $1.33 expected. Revenues also missed, coming in at $832.7M v the $845M expected.Management commented that the near-term environment will remain challenged due to heightened economic uncertainty, lower discretionary spending, and weaker consumer confidence. While that narrative doesn’t line up with the overall economic tone, management is clearly seeing issues with its business.One issue was Same Store Sales were down 4.6% v the +2.8% expected. The company now sees Q4 +1-3% year over year.EstimatesEarnings estimates have been trending lower as that Q3 report and revenue guide has forced analysts to continue to lower numbers.Over the last 60 days, numbers for the current quarter plummeted from $2.03 to $1.70 or 16%.For the current year, analysts have lowered estimates or 8% over that same time frame.Looking at the longer term, things do not improve. For next year, estimates have fallen from $6.98 to $6.58 over the last 60 days or almost 6%.Technical TakeThe stock is trading at multi-year lows in a market that has been very strong. This relative weakness is concerning, especially with a 5% dividend to offer investors.CBRL has had trouble at the $120 level and is now threatening to take out 2023 lows. If the company disappoints on earnings again, look for new lows and a possible test of the COVID lows.For bulls looking to buy, the 200-day moving average at $105 needs to be taken first. A combination of that technical breakout and an earnings turnaround would bring investors back into the name.In SummaryThe relative weakness shown in CBRL should signal to investors to shop elsewhere for their next investment. Don’t let that dividend tempt you and be patient with this one if you like the name.Additional content:3 Crypto Stocks to Watch on the 2023 Ethereum RallyWhile Bitcoin had a great first half of 2023, so did another crypto coin: Ethereum. Ethereum, which trails only Bitcoin in the crypto world, is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform.Since the “crypto winter” of 2022, the network completed a significant update, known as the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively small history of cryptocurrency.Under the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.Powered by this development and what has largely been hailed as a crypto rebound, the price of Ethereum has soared in 2023, going up 54.9% year to date, as of Jul 25. In this endeavor, it lags behind Bitcoin, which has gone up 76.4% in the same period. But one must remember that while Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain platform. Ethereum’s blockchain has a reputation for being highly versatile and adept in building complex applications.Historically, a state of fast-rising interest rates has not proven conducive to the crypto market. However, a recent spate of data, which showed cooling inflation and market speculation that the Fed might be ending its hawkish monetary policy stance soon, means that things are looking up again for the sector.So, with a “crypto spring” in the offing and Ethereum already starting to make good of the state of the market, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform.Accenture plc: This global system integrator, which provides consulting, technology and other services, markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.Accenture’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8.2%.

560,0680988e-b32b-34fb-8a41-d72a9f7e4a34,SHW,2023-07-27,3 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy on the Earnings Beat,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-rated-stocks-buy-210900251.html,1690405740,STORY,"['PCAR', 'KMB', 'SHW']","[Intriguingly, several top-rated Zacks stocks are standing out from various sectors after beating earnings expectations on Wednesday.With opportunity brewing, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), and PACCAR (PCAR) are three such stocks that investors should consider. Let’s review their strong quarterly reports and see why now is a good time to buy going forward.  Sherwin-Williams Q2 Review: There was a lot to like about Sherwin-Williams’ Q2 report on Wednesday and its stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Highlights included gross margin improving 46% YoY driven by strong sales volume in the company’s Paint Store Group segment along with double-digit percentage growth in earnings per share and EBITDA.Sherwin-Williams easily topped earnings expectations with EPS at $3.29 and 21% above estimates of $2.71 a share. On the top line, sales came in 4% above estimates at $6.24 billion. Overall, Q2 earnings soared 36% from the prior year quarter with sales up 6% from a year ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKimberly-Clark Q2 Review: Gross margin expansion was also a highlight of Kimberly-Clark’s Q2 report yesterday with its stock currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Gross margin was 33.7% up a respectable 3.5% from a year ago. Kimberly-Clark also highlighted another quarter of strong organic sales growth and raised its 2023 outlook for organic growth to 3%-5% and 10%-14% for adjusted earnings per share growth.To that point, Kimberly-Clark delivered double-digit earnings growth during Q2 with EPS climbing 23% YoY to $1.65 per share which topped estimates by 11%. Sales slightly beat expectations at $5.13 billion and rose 1% from a year ago. Kimberly-Clark stated its growth strategy is working with the consumer products giant completing the sale of its Brazil tissue assets in June while launching a new marketing campaign for its renowned diaper brand Huggies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesPACCAR Q2 Review: With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Paccar stock remains attractive after the company announced the achievement of record revenues and net income for the second quarter on Wednesday.The success was driven by increased truck deliveries (51,900 units), strong gross margins, and strengthening results from its parts distribution segment. Paccar’s record net income came in at $1.22 billion which soared 70% from $720.4 million in Q2 2022.This translated into EPS of $2.33 which beat earnings expectations by 8%. Second-quarter sales of $8.44 billion topped estimates by 2% and climbed 24% from the prior-year quarter. PACCAR also highlighted that it will increase its quarterly dividend by 8% from $0.25 per share to $0.27 per share, further bolstering the company’s strong business environment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Now is a good time to buy these top-rated Zacks stocks as their strong Q2 reports reconfirmed their strengthening outlooks. It’s quite plausible that earnings estimate revisions will continue to trend higher for Sherwin-Williams, Kimberly-Clark, and Paccar's stock which should lead to more upside following their stellar quarterly results.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

561,89c8f22b-465e-3319-ac84-aafcd16de6a4,SHW,2023-07-27,Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-shw-upgraded-strong-160006197.html,1690387206,STORY,['SHW'],"[Sherwin-Williams (SHW) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Sherwin-Williams basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Sherwin-Williams imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Sherwin-WilliamsFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this paint and coatings maker is expected to earn $8.75 per share, which is a change of 0.2% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Sherwin-Williams. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Sherwin-Williams to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Baxter; Senior Equity Analyst; Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research DivisionPresentationOperatorGood day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Universal Health Services Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead.Steve G. FiltonThank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K year ended December 31, 2022, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.42 for the second quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.53 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Our acute hospitals experienced strong demand for their services in the second quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 7.7% over the prior year. Even though the volume growth was skewed somewhat to lower acuity procedures, overall revenue growth was still a very robust 9.7%. While overall surgical volumes were solid, increasing about 5% from the prior year quarter, there was a continuing shift from inpatient to outpatient. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the second quarter was $75 million reflecting approximately 10% to 12% decline from the amount in the previous several quarters. The continued robust increase in acute volumes is the major reason that premium pay has not declined further. It's worth noting that our average hourly rate, which includes premium pay, was 4% lower than the second quarter of 2022. On a same-facility basis, EBITDA at our acute care hospitals increased 16% during the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. During the second quarter, same-facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.8%, primarily driven by a 6.2% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute care -- our acute behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers which tended to drive up the revenue per day beyond the already relatively robust levels we've been posting for several periods. With a similar level of revenue growth in the first quarter, same facility EBITDA for our behavioral hospitals has increased 12% in the first half of the year compared to the comparable prior year period. Our cash generated from operating activities was $654 million during the first 6 months of 2023 as compared to $478 million during the same period in 2022. In the first half of 2023, we spent $337 million on capital expenditures and acquired 1.4 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $192 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of June 30, 2023, we had $946 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. In our acute care segment, we continue to develop additional inpatient and ambulatory care capacity. We currently have 24 operational freestanding emergency departments as well as 3 additional which are expected to be completed and opened over the next 6 months and 9 more which have been approved and are in various stages of development. Also, construction continues on our de novo acute care hospitals consisting of the 150-bed West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is expected to open next fall; the 150-bed Alan B. Miller Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; and the 136 beds Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C., both of which are expected to open in 2025. In our behavioral health segment, we recently completed and opened the 120-bed River Vista Behavioral Health Hospital in Madera, California, and we broke ground on the 96-bed Southridge Behavioral Hospital in West Michigan, a joint venture with Trinity Health Michigan, which is expected to open later next year. I will now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for some closing comments.Story continuesMarc D. MillerThanks, Steve. We were generally pleased with our second quarter results as both of our business segments continued their transition into a post-pandemic world. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have continued their recovery trajectory, and have gradually begun to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. The comparison to last year's second quarter for our acute hospitals is the first apples-to-apples comparison of 2 low COVID volume quarters we have had since the pandemic began and the 60-basis-point year-over-year margin improvement in Q2 is a step towards a more extended margin recovery, we hope to sustain for the next several periods. In our acute segment, we highlighted the upward pressure on physician expense which tended to run at a rate of about 6% of revenues pre-pandemic, but is running closer to 7.6% in 2023. Based on the generally favorable operating trends in the first half of the year, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 EPS guidance from $9.50 a share to $9.85 a share. As we have previously disclosed, our 2023 guidance had originally assumed recognition in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $25 million of supplemental revenues from a Nevada Medicaid program. The state has dramatically reduced the funding for this program, and we now believe our fourth quarter revenue recognition will be only approximately $3 million. This reduction has informed our decision not to change the upper end of our guidance range at this time. It is worth noting that we believe a new Nevada state-directed program which we also have previously disclosed appears to still be on track for a 2024 implementation with a potentially materially favorable impact on our Nevada hospitals. We are pleased to answer questions at this time.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Cassorla from Citi.Jason Paul CassorlaI just wanted to ask about acute care volumes. I guess, obviously, a strong result for the first half, but wondering how you're feeling about the trajectory of those volumes in the back half of the year. And I know it's early, but do you think this creates a new base from which you grow off of for next year? Or do you think it still create kind of a set of difficult comps that you have to kind of overcome and work through in the first half of '24? Just any color or commentary around that would be helpful.Steve G. FiltonSure. I mean I think part of what we're experiencing in -- certainly in the first half of this year is what both, I think, providers and payers have anticipated for some time, and that is during the pandemic, there was some amount of deferral and postponement of procedures. And I think what both providers and payers have been reporting in the last quarter or 2 is that we've seen an uptick in volumes, particularly lower acuity volumes, elective and surgical procedures. Again, I think particularly skewed towards the Medicare population that probably was most prone to defer and postpone during the pandemic. It's very difficult for providers like us, and I think, quite frankly, for almost everybody, except for individual physicians to really try and precisely determine how much of current volume is an exhaustion of demand that was sort of postponed or deferred during the pandemic. I think the comment that we have made simply is that we had 10% adjusted admission growth in acute care in Q1, close to 8% in Q2. Those are really historically unprecedented numbers. So our expectation -- and again, I think Marc's comments were in Q2, for the first time, we had kind of an apples-to-apples comparison with last year in terms of low COVID volumes. We're expecting, I think, volumes to moderate in the future but also for acuity to rise and to return to sort of that mid-single-digit level of top line growth in acute care that has sort of long been the model. Whether that occurs in the next couple of quarters, whether we have a run of somewhat extended and enhanced volumes, I think is difficult for anyone to project. Obviously, it's been pretty strong for the last 6 months, early indications in July that remains that way. But we'll see. So again, I think some of our caution about guidance in the back half of the year is also informed by this idea that we're not exactly sure at what pace acute care volumes moderate, but there is some sense that they will. But generally feeling pretty good about overall acute care volumes which did suffer -- at least non-COVID volumes, which did suffer definitively during the pandemic.Jason Paul CassorlaGot it. Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up on the acute care physician subsidy expense. It sounds like that's coming in at an even greater pressure point than originally anticipated guidance. I guess, one, is that fair? And curious if that level of spending is at a tipping point now where maybe you need to perhaps consider greater levels of in-sourcing or other strategies to help offset and create kind of a good guy sort of set up for '24 and beyond? Any just thoughts on that would be helpful.Steve G. FiltonYes. So we have certainly been talking about and anticipating that 2023 would be a challenging year when it came to this issue of physician subsidy expense. We talked about back in February when we gave our 2023 guidance providing like a $55 million to $60 million increase in our guidance in physician expense. The reality is the rate of increase is probably running at about twice that. I do think that this is to some degree, sort of a transitory pressure. These contract service providers who provide much of our -- especially emergency room and anesthesiology coverage are -- many of them are facing pretty significant financial stress. There have been a number of high-profile bankruptcies in that area by these contract providers. And in this interim period, where we're having to replace or kind of substitute and either pay greater subsidies to our existing providers or to new providers or your question alluded to in source and hire these physicians ourselves, there's this sort of kind of onetime, hopefully, expenditure of money and dollars to make this transition. But at the end of the day, I think we have a point of view that there's X number of ER providers in the country, there's X number of anesthesiology providers in the country. And when this sort of current disruption settles out, those dollar increases like in 2024, will at a minimum level off and hopefully will actually decline. But we're not going to see this rate of increase over an extended period of time.OperatorNext question comes from Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets.Benjamin HendrixI was wondering if you could answer pretty much the same question on the softness in the behavioral that we saw this quarter versus first quarter. I think you had called out maybe some headwinds at some specific facilities. Just wanted to see kind of how that looks like in the back half? Is that an easy fix and what we can expect going forward?Steve G. FiltonYes. Well, I'll go back to the point that Marc made earlier. The first quarter comparison was a bit anomalous because we were comparing kind of a low COVID volume in Q1 of 2023 with a very high volume COVID quarter in 2022. So particularly on the behavioral side, that comparison was very favorable and volumes, revenue, EBITDA growth all looked very favorable in Q1. Q2 volume growth was a little more normalized, frankly, a little softer than we anticipated. I think that our acute behavioral volumes, and I made this comment in the prepared remarks, we're actually in line with our expectations, but the volumes in our residential treatment centers were somewhat lower than expectations as we kind of dived -- or delved into those numbers. It really seems like they were focused on a handful of facilities that were having specific issues, referral sources or regulatory issues that we believe will be corrected and largely resolved in the back half of the year, but didn't seem to be pervasive in any sort of company-wide or industry-wide sort of dynamic. So I think our view as we think about the behavioral business trajectory, the point that we've made for some time during the pandemic is that as COVID volumes eased, we would be able to hire more people. As we would be able to hire more people, we'd be able to generate more patient days, more volume, greater efficiencies, greater EBITDA growth. I think if you look at the first 6 months of the year, which, again, I made the point in my prepared remarks, EBITDA is up 12%. I think if you look at the last 4 quarters, EBITDA is up substantially. And I think that's how we're looking at the earnings power of our behavioral business. A bit of a slowdown in Q2, but I think -- we think the long-term trajectory is much more reflective of the experience we've had over the last 2 to 4 quarters.OperatorWe have a question from Andrew Mok from UBS.Andrew MokSame-store inpatient admissions were up about 7% in the quarter. But I think inpatient surgeries were only up about 1% or so. You mentioned lower acuity procedures, but I think those stats would imply some very strong medical growth or nonsurgical growth. Can you elaborate on the nature of the procedures you're seeing on the inpatient side?Steve G. FiltonYes. So what I said in my prepared remarks was that overall surgical growth was up about 5% Q2 over Q2, which we view as a pretty solid outcome skewed more towards outpatient growth so outpatient procedures -- outpatient surgical procedures were up 8%, inpatient were only up 1%. But that obviously affects acuity. And again, I think in my mind, this is sort of an intuitive result. If what we're seeing in terms of the volume growth in acute care is, to some degree, a recapture of postponed and deferred procedures. It makes sense that those deferred and postponed procedures were of the lower acuity nature. Almost by definition, if people had emergency health care needs during the pandemic, those were attended to. But the things that were deferred were more elective, more discretionary procedures, both surgical and medical. And again, I think that's the dynamic you're seeing in terms of very high volumes but somewhat more muted acuity.Andrew MokGot it. And just a quick follow-up. How is the Reno Hospital tracking against expectations. Can you help quantify the contribution that, that hospital had on same-store admissions growth in the quarter?Steve G. FiltonYes. I don't have those exact admission numbers for the Reno Hospital in front of me, but I'll say that -- what we have said was included in our 2023 guidance was about a $25 million or $30 million turnaround at the Reno Hospital. I think we're tracking -- I think we anticipated that, that would be a little back-end loaded, and I think that's right. I think we probably had about a $4 million or $5 million improvement in Q2. But I think we're generally tracking for that level of improvement for the full year, and that's our expectation. My sense is the Reno Hospital is not large enough to have had a significant impact on admissions one way or the other in the quarter.OperatorOur next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research.Joshua Richard RaskinJust the first question, getting back to the behavioral health margins. I think in the past, you've suggested, and I think you just alluded to this, Steve, that there just weren't enough clinicians to hire and that sort of slowed your volumes. Are you now able to find these clinicians? If so, where are they coming from? And are different categories, maybe nurses versus MD is performing different roles. I'm just curious how you're feeling that capacity.Steve G. FiltonYes. I mean, so what I think we have said pretty consistently throughout the pandemic is that the pandemic itself -- and I should start by making the point that prior to the pandemic, in late 2019, early 2020, I think we would have described, and I think most of our provider colleagues would have described the labor market. It's pretty tight back then. The overall unemployment rate in the country was, I think, pretty close to full employment, clinical employment, particularly nursing employment was very tight. .The pandemic then really exacerbates that tightness, particularly for subacute providers like behavioral providers because we started to lose a great many nurses, especially nurses to these high-level premium pay opportunities they were having working in acute care hospitals and COVID units or ERs or ICUs, et cetera. And the argument we made all along was that as COVID volumes declined, those opportunities for these extraordinary pay increases would decline and nurses would return to their we'll sort of call it home base and employment. And I think that's what we've been seeing I'm going to say, for the last 12 or 15 months, I'm going to say at least back to the spring -- the early spring of 2022. And we're seeing that. Now what we're seeing is an increase in base wage rates in order for us to get those folks back. So I think wage inflation and behavioral or average hourly rate increase in Q2 over the prior year is more like 4.5%, 5%, which is certainly higher than it was running in the pandemic. And again, you see some of that in our salary, overall salary increases. But at the end of the day, and this is the point that I was trying to make before, I think what we've demonstrated, especially over the last 3 quarters, and to a lesser degree, in Q2 of this year is, as we're able to hire more people, we're able to generate more volumes and as a consequence, EBITDA growth, margin improvement, et cetera. It's not a directly-it's not a ratable increase every single quarter. But -- and again, there's some element of timing here as we hire new people, they have to be trained and oriented and that causes some level of inefficiency. But over time, I think we have the view that we're going to continue to be able to hire more people in behavioral and admit more patients and that's going to lead to a long-term growth trajectory in that business.Joshua Richard RaskinGot you. Got you. And then just one more on United spoke about a large increase in the incidence of mental health utilization, just more people seeking services. Do you think that translates to more inpatient care? Or is that a level of acuity that's been more steady on the inpatient side and maybe that's more lower acuity?Steve G. FiltonYes. My recollection from reading the United transcript was that they specifically talked about that increase being skewed to outpatient procedures. And obviously, I think outpatient is a more highly competitive sort of market for behavioral, there's a lot more competitors. I think our view is over the long term, the more people who are getting care and getting appropriate assessments, et cetera, is good for our business, which tends to have a much broader continuum of care that includes more intensive outpatient and partial hospitalization and all sorts of inpatient care across many diagnoses. So I think we have a view that while we didn't necessarily experience that same growth in outpatient that United referred to specifically, I think, in their first -- second quarter call, that ultimately down the road, we're likely to benefit from more and more people getting the appropriate level of behavioral care and assessment.OperatorOur next question comes from Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners.Benjamin Whitman MayoSteve, I appreciate the comments on Nevada and the supplemental Medicaid program changes. Any way to potentially size how you guys are thinking about the potential contribution of that in 2024? I know there's still some moving pieces and approvals that need to happen.Steve G. FiltonYes. So we're waiting with for the state to resume more specific guidance about how their specific methodology is going to work, et cetera. But based on our broad understanding of how this program is going to work as I think Marc commented in his prepared remarks, our expectation is that this could have a materially favorable benefit on our Nevada hospitals. But we're anxiously waiting for the state to issue more specifics surrounding the calculations and the methodology and the size of the pool, et cetera, which we think could be forthcoming, I'm going to sort of say in the near intermediate term. But certainly, we think there'll be a lot more clarity by the end of the year.Benjamin Whitman MayoYes. Okay. No, that's helpful. We've gotten some questions around the Cerner Oracle EMR investments you guys are making. None of this is new. But just maybe remind us the income statement, CapEx impact, how many hospitals you're thinking about converting? I can't imagine that's all of your facilities, just time line and any review of that initiative?Steve G. FiltonSure. So as you said, this is not necessarily really new news. We originally committed to a behavioral EMR implementation with Cerner. Going back a couple of years, and after Cerner's acquisition by Oracle, Oracle wanted to do this press release, which is fine. But to be clear, I mean, it's not new. We've already implemented a handful of facilities in 2022. We'll implement another round of facilities in 2023. If you read the press release, it doesn't refer to the number of facilities. I think when at least one of the news media outlets picked up the story they sort of combine the fact that we were making this announcement with the fact that we've got 200 behavioral facilities here in the U.S. and said that we were committed to implement 200 facilities. As your question alludes to, we certainly have not yet committed to that. we have smaller residential facilities that may not be appropriate for an investment of this scale, et cetera. So I think the point -- I mean, I think that we will spend significantly less on behavioral EMR than we did on the acute care EMR, I think, around $220 million, $230 million a number of years ago on the implementation of an acute care EMR. I think we'll spend substantially less on behavioral and they'll be spread out over, I think, a 5- or 6-year period. So I don't think that the individual impact of the investment is going to have a significant impact. The other piece is we had an expectation that there are operating efficiencies that we'll gain and garner from the implementation. So a significant chunk of that investment should be offset with operating efficiencies.OperatorWe have a question from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceI know you've gotten some good rate increases on the behavioral side the last year or so is -- I know a lot of states reset their rates midyear. I also know you've got ongoing discussions on the commercial side. Medicare, we can track that easier. But any update on thinking about where rates settle out back half of the year into next year for commercial and Medicaid in the behavioral side?Steve G. FiltonYes. I mean, A.J., I think our comments on rate increases and behavioral have been pretty consistent. They definitely -- historically, revenue per day in the behavioral division has generally increased sort of 2% or 3% a year, pretty consistently pre-pandemic. During the pandemic, we saw those numbers rise to something much closer to 5% to 6%. And then I think we've generally discussed that, and we think the main reason for that is we've been able to leverage the fact that there is capacity constraints in the industry as we've already talked about on this call because of -- labor capacity especially. And we've been going to our lowest payers and either demanding increases from them or canceling those contracts that we view to be inadequate and simply admitting patients whose insurance will pay us more, again, in an environment where we can only treat a limited number of patients, we can be more selective about who we treat and the fairness of what we think we're being paid. What we have said is we think that as we're able to admit more patients, our ability to leverage that diminishes a little bit and maybe that revenue per day increase that had been running 5% to 6% moderates more to 4% to 5%. We were again a little over 6% in the quarter, although that, I think, is a function not only of the rate increases we're getting but also of the mix of acute versus residential patients, as I mentioned before. But I think generally, our price -- the pricing environment in behavioral remains strong. We remain aggressive that we've terminated or issued notice of termination in a great many markets to a great many payers. We're pursuing this strategy pretty aggressively and feel like there's runway to do so for the foreseeable future.Albert J. William RiceOkay. I know you talked about the new facility in Vegas and the trajectory there. But maybe stepping back, I know you've got concentrated portfolios in the acute side in Vegas and Southern California and D.C. and Southwest Texas, any dispersion? Obviously, you had good overall volume growth. Was there much of a difference in the performance in those major geographic markets this quarter?Steve G. FiltonSo I think like most of our -- or several of our public peers, HCA and Tenet, I think most notably have commented in the last year or so that their facilities in Texas and Florida have been recovering at a more rapid rate than in other geographies. I think as those states have emerged from the pandemic, more around the economies in those states have emerged on the pandemic more rapidly. I think honestly, that has been sort of a bit of a negative comparison for us. Again, over the last year or so because we've got less of a relative footprint in Texas and Florida and more in Nevada and California than our peers. But I think what we're seeing now is the recovery in those geographies is starting to pick up pace, et cetera. I think our performance in Nevada was particularly improved in the quarter. And obviously, that's always a significant piece of good news for us. I will say that to have the sort of acute care performance we had, in particular, the top line and EBITDA growth of 16% that's got to be pretty broad-based. It really can't be specific to one single market, and I don't think it was. But again, the encouraging, I think, element for us specifically was the improvement in our Nevada results in the quarter.OperatorWe have a question from Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs.Jamie Aaron PerseI just wanted to go back to the other operating expenses within acute for a second. You spoke about some of the bankruptcies for vendors in the space. Are there specific sort of onetime disruption costs in the $590 million you realized this quarter? I'm just trying to understand where we're going from here, if that's the right new baseline? Or if you can take cost out at some point? Just any more color on the near term and how to model that line item?Steve G. FiltonYes. Look, I made the point earlier, Jamie, that we anticipated a significant increase in those physician subsidy expenses in our 2023 guidance. But in the first 6 months, they're tracking twice the rate that we anticipated. But I also tried to make the point that I think we believe that these really dramatic increases are a function of this current disruption. We've got providers who are telling us one or two things. One is that they just can't continue. They've declared bankruptcy, and they can't continue to provide the contract services that we're contracted for. And we're having to replace them generally at a higher cost, whether we're contracting out to somebody else or hiring these folks in. And again, there's the sort of transition costs that I think are largely onetime in nature. But I think we're going to continue to experience these for the next quarter or so. I think, we have a general view that by the time we get to 2024 -- however, this has settled out either -- and I'm not sure there's a single answer. But I think, either a lot of these providers, these ER and anesthesiology physicians will be employed by hospitals and by us or they'll be employed by more local and regional providers who are more healthy financially, et cetera. But we're going to see a leveling off of this expense. I don't know that we're able to predict exactly how you should model that in the future. And again, I think in my mind, the positive view of this in the quarter is acute care EBITDA is 16% higher than it was last year's Q2, despite the fact that we've got this significantly increased burden of physician expense. We feel like when that levels off next year, that's going to provide a boost to our earnings power.Jamie Aaron PerseOkay. And you and other hospitals have always talked about a strong margin profile on surgery. Just given the tailwinds that seem to be in the surgical space at this point, can you give us any color on how to think about profit margins in your surgical business or profit contribution on average from surgeries?Steve G. FiltonYes. I mean, I think if you think about if -- however you want to find our long-term acute care margins in the upper teens, I'm going to call it 17%, something like that. But I think, surgical margins tend to be probably 5 to 10 basis points above that and medical margins tend to be 5 to 10 basis points below that. Obviously, there's a lot of difference depending on the specific procedure, the length of stay, the demographics of the patient base, et cetera. But historically, surgical margins have been measurably higher than medical margins.OperatorOur next question will come from Scott Fidel from Stephens.Scott J. FidelA couple of recent developments or proposals on the policy side, I would be interested to get your initial thoughts on -- the first was the CMS proposal that came out around the intensive outpatient benefit for behavioral in Medicare. And then just yesterday, I know it just came out, so don't expect too detailed commentary, but the Biden administration did also just come out with -- with an updated proposal really sort of focused on health plans around mental health parity and sort of enforcing that around in-network for behavioral. So just interested on both those proposals, if you have any initial thoughts on potential risks and opportunities there.Steve G. FiltonYes. So I'll tackle the parity one, which I know is the more recent one, Scott, first. As you pointed out, I mean, I think the Biden administration announced yesterday that they were going to issue new rules on mental health parity, which they did this morning, and I appreciate your acknowledgment that we have not had a chance to review those. I think the broad context here is mental health parity legislation originally passed almost 15 years ago.But I think, the industry has always been frustrated that the amount of adherence and an enforcement on the part of the government has never at least been as fulsome as the industry would have liked. And without reading the specific regulations or having a chance to read the specific regulations, I think the one positive that we take away is that the current administration seems focused on the fact that there needs to be better enforcement, there need -- the mental health parity legislation originally was, I think, viewed very positively for the industry. And I do think it had a positive impact, but I think it should be more positive. And I think we would argue that there have been plans and payers that have sort of tried to dodge the intent of the legislation and we believe that any effort on the part of this administration to more aggressively enforce those parity laws is welcome. The intensive outpatient regulations, I'll sort of make repeat the same comments I was making just about United's commercial comments or commercial utilization comments before -- I think that any new developments that allow people or encourage people to get more access to in terms of outpatient or behavioral care in general are generally going to be positive for us. We have a lot of intensive outpatient offerings. But I think more than that, I think we had this complete continuum of care from very low acute outpatients or very high acute inpatients, that the more people who are given access to care and behavioral diagnosis and assessment. I think that's generally good news for us. So I would say, we view both of these developments as a positive. I think, we view them consistent with, I think, general legislative and administrative sort of favorability to the behavioral business at both the federal and state level, difficult to quantify the benefit for either of those in any sort of precise way.Scott J. FidelGot it. And then just one quick follow-up. Just on the Medicare volume sort of normalization that we've been seeing. Anyway, can you sort of tease out just in the second quarter, how I guess that's sort of skewed between outpatient and inpatient? Obviously, we know that it's felt seem to be sort of heavily driven by outpatient. But I'm interested whether you saw a pickup in the inpatient side skew on the Medicare volumes as well.Steve G. FiltonYes. I mean, so we saw, as we said, adjusted admissions increased by almost 8% in the quarter. Some of that is certainly driven by the outpatient activity. But obviously, pure admission growth was also pretty strong. Again, I just feel like what you're seeing is, it is a bit skewed towards the lower acuity procedures. And again, not by a tremendous amount. I mean, we saw overall revenue per adjusted admission on the acute side increased by 2% or so in the quarter. I think normally, we would expect that number to be more in the 2% to 4% range. So it's kind of on the low end. But there's a little bit more of that skew to -- I think, it's not so much -- I mean, it is clearly an inpatient and outpatient issue, but I think it's more of an issue of skewing more towards those elective and deferred procedures that were postponed whether they were in or outpatient during the pandemic and are now being realized in greater numbers.OperatorOur next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.Justin LakeFirst question, I wanted to ask about what you're seeing from the payers. I know you already got asked about pricing. But given Medicaid payers are heading into redeterminations, Medicare Advantage payers are talking about higher utilization. Steve, are you seeing any early kind of signs of increased medical management claims, denial, et cetera, the typical stuff that managed care will do when their costs are or might be a little bit higher?Steve G. FiltonYes. So two things or two comments that you made, Justin. I mean, one is, we're not seeing, I think, at least a measurable impact that we can identify from Medicaid redetermination so far. I do think again, we -- Marc commented on the rationale for not raising the upper end of our guidance, he commented on the Nevada supplemental payment. I do think that's a big piece of it. But I think we also have a view that there may yet be an impact from Medicaid redeterminations in the back half of the year in both of the businesses that we have not yet seen. So we're paying very close attention to that, and that's a focus. But I think your other comment is also well taken, and that is with a lot of the payers reporting an increase in their own medical laws utilization, we have an expectation that we're going to see more aggressive behavior on their part to whatever it may be limit length to stay on the behavioral side or challenge more inpatient versus observation, classification on the acute side. I can't say that we can say definitively that we've seen that change in a measurable way just yet. I think it sometimes takes a quarter or 2 for that information to sort of play out. But I will tell you that we're very prepared for and very focused on it. I think in all sorts of ways, I think we're trying to change our contracts so that these issues are more defined, that are in upfront in the contract, but also in the way that we provide billing information and we go through the appeal process. So all those things are a significant focus of ours. But I think you are suggesting that managed care payers are likely to become more aggressive in their utilization review procedures, is something we're very sensitive to and prepared for.Justin LakeI appreciate that. Maybe you can expand on your commentary around redeterminations. I know, a lot of us are uncertain how this plays out. But one kind of line of thinking is that a bunch of people are going to be kicked off Medicaid, and a lot of them could end up on the exchanges or on private employer health plans, which pay a lot better, right, especially on the acute side, but even on the behavioral side. So how do you think about that vis-a-vis? Do you just think that, is your concern that a lot of folks are going to be unfortunately remove from the roles and not pick up other coverage? Is it your market specific to you, given your geographic exposure? Or do you think that's just broad-based? And what drives that?Steve G. FiltonYes. So I think that we generally concur, as your question sort of alluded to with the sort of broad way that a number of analysts both, I'm going to say, this passionate analysts like CMS and the Urban Institute, et cetera, when they looked at the potential impact of redeterminations and then the number of sell-side folks have done, pretty exhaustive studies. And I think, they all conclude largely the way you framed your question that ultimately, there will be a sufficient number of people who are redetermined off the Medicaid roles but who can requalify on better paying commercial products, commercial exchange products that the net impact to providers will be a positive one. I think, our sort of skepticism or concern or caution is more short term or timing related in nature and that is as we go through the process and people get redetermined off, how quickly can they requalify for commercial products, et cetera. And again, I just don't think we've had enough time to really measure whether there could be sort of a short-term bump or a drain on this. But I think in the long run, we think we probably come out at least whole, if not somewhat ahead. The good news from my perspective is based on the redetermination data that I've seen, while there have been a lot of people redetermined off, a lot of those redeterminations a good chunk of them are sort of more for administrative reasons. Their paperwork is not up to date, their address is not up date, whatever it may be. And so it feels like those people will be able to get back on the Medicaid roles quickly. So it feels like maybe the impact in the long run is not going to be as significant as we might have thought. But again, our point of view is maybe some short-term uncertainty over the long term, I don't think we think this is really going to be a net negative for providers.OperatorOur next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.Kevin Mark FischbeckI want to go back to, I guess, Marc's comments about both segments starting to transition to that post-pandemic world. Do you guys -- how are you thinking about what the company's two businesses look like in that world? Is it right to just assume that from a margin perspective, things look like 2018, 2019, is there a reason to believe that margins might be higher or lower over time? And how do you think about that path and the timing of getting to whatever that normalization is?Steve G. FiltonYes. I think the answer, Kevin, is a little bit different for each of the segments. I think -- and I think we touched on this to some degree in the call today, but certainly in previous calls as well. I think on the behavioral side, our view is that margins during the pandemic, particularly were diminished or negatively impacted by the labor scarcity. And again, the argument goes that as we are able to hire more people, we'll be able to create and really not create but exhaust more of the unmet demand that's been out there. And I think our view on behavioral is not only should we be able to return to 2019 margins ultimately, but to return to sort of peak behavioral margins, we'd probably go back to 2014 or 2015.Now just to be clear, when I say that, I mean, I don't think that's an immediate. I don't think that happens obviously in the next quarter or 2. But I think it is this sort of gradual trajectory of relatively robust top line growth and relatively fixed and semi-fixed expenses that allow us to do that. I think on the acute side, it's a bit -- a little bit more of a mix story. There was certainly some benefit to the acute care business from the pandemic itself from the acuity of the COVID patients, from the special reimbursement that we received related to COVID patients, et cetera. And so, I think it's a little bit more challenging for the acute business to get back to those pre-pandemic margins. Because they've got to replace a lot of that, I'm going to say, COVID and patient-related benefit. Now clearly, they've been doing that over the last few quarters. And again, this gets back to, I think, a question of how sustainable this higher level of acute care volume is going to be. But again, pretty much -- pretty similar. I think we certainly feel like we're 400, 500 basis points on the acute side, below where our pre-pandemic margins were, as Marc -- Marc's comments in his prepared remarks where we got 60 basis points of that back in Q2. We view that as a first step, which we hope to sustain for many more quarters to get back there or get close to pre-pandemic margins.Kevin Mark FischbeckYes. So it sounds to me like and to some degree in both cases, it's the volume number that's going to get you back to where you were. I guess, the behavioral one makes sense, labor is a constraint you fix that. The Q1 though, it's still a little bit unclear to me. I understand the concept of pent-up demand, but when you just finally got above 2019 levels when historically, you've been growing volumes a couple of percent per year, kind of well below that long-term trend line. What is it that makes you cautious to say that you wouldn't get back to that long-term trend line? Aren't the population growth, demographics and fundamental demand drivers in your markets really unchanged? So why do you get concerned at this as a bolus rather than the new normal?Steve G. FiltonYes. And again, I'm not -- I don't think we've -- in any way, given up the hope that we can get back to acute care margins -- pre-pandemic acute care margins. I'm simply suggesting that I think, the recovery or the path to recovery is a little more complicated on the acute side because there were some benefits from the pandemic that they just clearly were not on the behavioral side. The pandemic really had only negative consequences for our behavioral business. And therefore, I think recovery from the pandemic is sort of steeper and more robust and quicker, quite frankly, on the behavioral side than it is on the acute side. Look, I think what you're seeing is some pretty rapid recovery on the acute side. But again, it's being driven by what I think we would argue are probably some level of extraordinary volumes that will moderate some. But look, I think if you look at the acute care business model and earnings trajectory over an extended period of time with kind of mid-single-digit revenue growth in that 5% or 6% range we have generally been able to produce EBITDA growth, margin improvement, et cetera. And I don't think there's any reason we can't sustain that level of top line growth for the foreseeable future. I do think it may take us a little bit longer to get there than it will on the behavioral side.Kevin Mark FischbeckOkay. All right. So I think I got it, but just to make sure to [decide all up,] you're not saying that this year's volumes become a headwind to next year because there's some sort of unsustainable bolus. It's -- this is probably a good base, but we just shouldn't assume 7% volume growth, we should assume from here more normalized volume growth? Or are you saying that there could be a headwind next year from a comp perspective?Steve G. FiltonYes. Again, hard to know, Kevin, but we had 10% revenue growth, obviously, in this quarter. Again, that's at a historically high level. I don't -- again, I'm not giving 2024 guidance at this point, but I don't know that we'll be able to sustain that level of revenue growth. Two things. I think the level of revenue growth probably moderates a little bit. I think the makeup of that revenue growth changes to somewhat less volume, somewhat more acuity in pricing. But I think, again, if that 10% revenue growth moderates to 6% or 7%, I still think that's a model in which we're likely to see increased EBITDA and margin expansion.OperatorWe have a question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.Stephen C. BaxterA follow-up on an earlier question. I wanted to see if you could expand a little bit more on the behavioral margins in the quarter. Usually pre-COVID margins increased sequentially in the second quarter. Obviously, you had a different experience this quarter with SWB and other OpEx as a percent of revenue up sequentially. Wondering what drove those increases? And how did margins internally compare to your expectations? And do you think we should see something closer to typical seasonality in the balance of the year?Steve G. FiltonYes. And operator, I'm just going to make the point, this is going to have to be our last question. So we had a few non-recurring items in the quarter. We had a loss on disposal of assets that were about $3 million. We had an unfavorable exchange rate, which was affecting us in the U.K. by a couple of million dollars. But just generally, I think we saw salaries increased a little bit more than we expected in the quarter. And this is a point I was making or in responding to an earlier question. I mean, I think generally, our ability to hire people and fill these vacant positions is a positive development. In the short run, it can be somewhat inefficient. We have a lot of people in orientation and training. A lot of these people that we're hiring are somewhat less experienced and less trained and particularly in behavioral care, then were used to historically. And that creates a little bit of inefficiency again, in the short run, I think in the long run, and that's why I'm suggesting to people not to focus so much on just the second quarter, but on the first 6 months of the year or the last 4 months -- of the last 4 quarters where we've really been emerging from the pandemic not being impacted by COVID, being able to hire people. And I think the -- broadly, the results there show that we're going to continue to grow the top line, but also generate the efficiencies that we think generally come with that top line growth. And I think that's still fundamentally our belief. So I think that's the way we're looking at the business. Thanks for your question. And operator, I think we're going to have to stop at this point in time.OperatorOkay. I'd like to turn it back to Steve Filton for any closing remarks.Steve G. FiltonYes, just to thank everybody for their time this morning, and we look forward to speaking with everybody again after our third quarter.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

(NYSE: AWK) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, of $1.44 per share, compared to $1.20 per share for the same quarter in 2022 and $2.37 per share for the year-to date period ended June 30, 2023, compared to $2.07 per share for the same period in 2022.""The company has delivered excellent results for the first half of the year,"" said M. Susan Hardwick, president and CEO of American Water. ""We continue to execute on our strategy and are well positioned to achieve our expected growth in 2023 and beyond.""""Also in the first half of the year we have successfully completed our entire 2023 financing plan with the issuance of the exchangeable senior notes in June. In total, just over $1.0 billion was issued with an annual interest rate of 3.625%. This follows our $1.7 billion common equity issuance in March. With our financing for the year secured, the company is well-positioned to fund our near-term growth plan using long-term capital,"" said Hardwick.2023 EPS Guidance and Long-Term Financial Targets AffirmedThe company affirms its 2023 earnings per share guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82, on a weather-normalized basis. The company also affirms its long-term financial targets for the 2023-2027 period announced in Nov. 2022, including its long-term EPS and dividend growth rate targets of 7-9%. The company’s earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under ""Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements"" below and under ""Risk Factors"" in its annual, quarterly, and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). All statements related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.Story continuesConsolidated ResultsFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, earnings per share were $1.44 and $2.37, respectively, compared to $1.20 and $2.07 per share in the same periods in 2022. These increases were primarily driven by the implementation of new rates in the Regulated Businesses for the recovery of capital and acquisition investments, offset somewhat by increased production costs, including inflationary pressures, and higher pension costs since mid-2022. Approximately 75% of the estimated impact of increased production costs, including chemicals, power and other fuel, and of higher pension costs, are reflected in higher revenues in 2023 from rate cases recently completed. Results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, also reflect the favorable impact of weather, estimated at $0.07 per share, due to warm, dry weather in the second quarter of 2023. Results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, also reflect the impact of share dilution from the equity financing of $0.10 and $0.11 per share, respectively, which offsets the avoided interest expense.The company is on track to meet its capital investment plan for the year with investments of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2023, including $1.15 billion for infrastructure improvements and replacements in the Regulated Businesses. The company plans to invest a total of approximately $2.9 billion across its footprint in 2023, including approximately $0.4 billion for acquisitions. As of June 30, 2023, the company had $555 million of acquisitions under agreement, including the wastewater assets of the Butler Area Sewer Authority in Pennsylvania for a total purchase price of $232 million, and the wastewater treatment plant from Granite City, Illinois for $83 million, both of which the company now expects to close in late 2023, pending each acquisition’s regulatory approval.Regulated BusinessesIn the second quarter of 2023, Regulated Businesses’ net income was $278 million, compared to $219 million for the same period in 2022. For the first six months of 2023, the Regulated Businesses’ net income was $452 million, compared to $379 million for the same period in 2022.Operating revenues increased $140 million and $222 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase in operating revenues was primarily a result of authorized revenue increases from completed general rate cases and infrastructure proceedings for the recovery of incremental capital and acquisition investments.To date, the company has been authorized additional annualized revenues of $273 million from general rate cases in 2023. Further, $67 million of additional annualized revenues from infrastructure surcharges have been authorized and are effective in 2023. The company has general rate cases in progress in four jurisdictions, and has filed for infrastructure surcharges in one jurisdiction, reflecting a total annualized revenue request of $155 million.Operation and maintenance (""O&amp;M"") expenses were higher by $24 million and $39 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily due to increases in production costs, including from inflationary pressures, that began to accelerate in mid-2022 and an increase in employee headcount to support growth in the business. Pension costs, included in Other Inc/Exp, were also higher in the quarter and year-to-date periods. Depreciation expense was higher by $15 million and $29 million in the same periods, respectively, due to the growing capital investment. Also, net interest expense was higher by $9 million and $31 million, in the same periods, respectively, due to additional long-term debt and higher rates on short-term debt.For the 12-month period ended June 30, 2023, the company’s adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) was 33.1%, compared to 33.7% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2022. The ratio reflects an increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses, after considering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (""EADIT"") shown in the table below, as well as the continued focus on operating costs.Exchangeable Senior Note IssuanceOn June 29, 2023, American Water Capital Corp. (""AWCC""), the wholly owned finance subsidiary of American Water, issued $1.035 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the ""Notes""). AWCC received net proceeds of approximately $1.022 billion, after deduction of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deduction of offering expenses payable by AWCC. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and the remainder is being used for general corporate purposes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of AWCC and have the benefit of a support agreement from parent company, which serves as the functional equivalent of a guarantee by parent company of the obligations of AWCC under the Notes. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier exchanged or repurchased. Upon exchange of the Notes, AWCC will (1) pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be exchanged and (2) pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), cash, shares of parent common stock or a combination of cash and shares of parent common stock, at AWCC’s election, in an amount equal to its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being exchanged.DividendsOn July 26, 2023, the company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.7075 per share of common stock, payable on September 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2023.2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference CallThe conference call to discuss second quarter 2023 earnings will take place on Thursday, July 27, 2023, at 9 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Interested parties may listen to an audio webcast through a link on the company’s Investor Relations website at ir.amwater.com. Presentation slides that will be used in conjunction with the earnings conference call will also be made available online in advance at ir.amwater.com. The company recognizes its website as a key channel of distribution to reach public investors and as a means of disclosing material non-public information to comply with its obligations under SEC Regulation FD.Following the earnings conference call, a replay of the audio webcast will be available for one year on American Water’s investor relations website at ir.amwater.com/events.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release includes a presentation of adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio, a ""non-GAAP financial measure"" under SEC rules, which excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses, reductions for the amortization of EADIT, and the allocable portion of non-O&amp;M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes. These items were excluded from the O&amp;M efficiency ratio calculation as they do not reflect management’s ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the company’s GAAP disclosures and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure.Management evaluates its operating performance using this ratio and believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to the company’s investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency of the company’s Regulated Businesses. The company’s adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this press release.Set forth in this release is a table that calculates the company’s adjusted regulated O&amp;M efficiency ratio and reconciles each of the components used to calculate this ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.About American WaterAmerican Water (NYSE: AWK) is the largest regulated water and wastewater utility company in the United States.

The good news is the politburo in the last couple of days has indicated quite strongly that it will take some action,"" Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad told reporters.""What we are certain about is that there will be a recovery, what we are not certain about is the length of time that it is going to take to get from here to that recovery,"" Wanblad said.On Monday, China pledged more support for its slowing economy.Anglo, however, said it is on track to deliver on 2023 production guidance, which includes a significant increase in volumes for the metals it mines during the later half of the year, helping its share price gain around 1% by 1007 GMT.""We continue to see Anglo American as providing strong relative value and with operations expected to improve in the second half, improved prospects as the year progresses,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda.In the first half, a 42% increase in copper production, underpinned by the ramp-up of the group's Quellaveco mine operations in Peru, was offset by lower output for coking coal, used in steelmaking, and platinum group metals.Story continuesThe company declared an interim dividend of $0.55 per share, down 56% from $1.24 a year earlier and far below record levels of 2021, and said net debt was $8.8 billion by June 30, compared with $4.85 billion a year earlier and a consensus estimate of $8.7 billion.EXECUTIVE CHANGESAnglo on Thursday appointed John Heasley from engineering company Weir as its new finance director to replace Stephen Pearce, whose retirement was announced in May, and promoted Craig Miller to the role of CEO of its South African unit Amplats.The London-listed miner has made several management changes over the past year, including appointing new CEOs for the group and diamond unit De Beers.Part of Anglo's diversification stems from De Beers, which posted a profit of $347 million in the first half, down 63% from $944 million in the first six months of 2022, as inflation reduced demand.""I don't expect an overnight recovery but we do expect that, as GDP pulls up and China's recovery gathers pace, diamonds demand will follow that, as it always has done,"" CEO Al Cook told Reuters.De Beers on July 1 struck a new long-term sales deal with the government of Botswana, where they jointly own Africa's largest diamond producer Debswana.(Reporting by Clara Denina and Richard Rohan Francis; editing by Miral Fahmy, Susan Fenton and David Evans)]"
570,360db171-ff34-3450-8f7f-32cc901d252b,FCX,2023-07-27,Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-attracting-130006364.html,1690376406,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned +8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has gained 15.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +42.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.53 points to a change of -37.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -13%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.14 indicates a change of +39.4% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.9%. The $22.65 billion and $23.93 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.6% and +5.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +25%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By establishing and scaling financial, agronomic and social programs, it aims to enable and accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland and deliver approximately 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals by 2030 – roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity needed to power 778,300 homes for one year1.PepsiCo (PRNewsfoto/PepsiCo, Inc.)Commenting on the voluntary adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, Jeff Huffman, Owner &amp; Operator of Island Farms LLC in Maxwell, Neb., said, ""From my perspective, embracing regenerative agriculture is essential. It's good for farmers, not only because it's beneficial to the environment and our food quality, but also for the profitability of our businesses. If you use less fertilizer and you grow a bigger crop, or if you use less water and can still grow the same size of crop, it strengthens your farm in a way that benefits the bottom line and our environment for generations to come.""PepsiCo's and Walmart's businesses are dependent on farmers to grow ingredients that are used to make the delicious products that consumers enjoy every day. With a supply chain for the two companies that stretches across North America and involves a large volume of critical crops – including potatoes, oats, corn, wheat, soybean and rice – sustainability will look different from commodity to commodity, region to region, and even farm to farm. The collaboration between PepsiCo and Walmart offers a voluntary, flexible approach to regenerative agriculture that gives farmers a seat at the table, recognizes the diversity of agriculture and that one size does not fit all.Story continues""Successful sustainability starts and ends with trust. At PepsiCo, we work very hard to earn the trust of the farmer so they understand that we are investing in their legacy and they can hand their farm down to the next generation,"" said Jim Andrew, Chief Sustainability Officer, PepsiCo. ""Farmers know their business better than anyone else, and what we hear from them is that for regenerative agriculture to make business sense, three things need to happen. They need economic support, social and cultural support, and agronomic support. This strategic collaboration with Walmart will advance our shared goal to have farmers' backs as they transform farming in a way that benefits the planet and people.""""At Walmart, our sustainability strategy is built to make the everyday choice the sustainable choice for our customers. This collaboration with PepsiCo is a great example of how we are prioritizing the expansion of regenerative agricultural practices among farmers across North America so that we can continue to make quality products affordable and accessible for customers. This collaboration aims to help elevate farmer livelihoods, engage them on how to more sustainably manage soil health, increase yields and create a model that others can mimic across other product categories, including encouraging additional investments in regenerative agriculture by other brands,"" said Jane Ewing, Senior Vice President for sustainability at Walmart.PepsiCo and Walmart have a shared focus on supporting farming communities while improving soil and water health, as well as lowering carbon emissions. As the largest convenient food and beverage company in North America, a resilient food system is essential to PepsiCo's business and its ability to meet its ambitious pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) goals, which include driving the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres by 2030 – an area approximately the size of PepsiCo's agricultural footprint – and reducing absolute GHG emissions by more than 40% across its entire value chain by 2030 (against a 2015 baseline) while striving toward net-zero emissions by 2040.""This effort is a new model for PepsiCo, marking our first, large-scale strategic collaboration focused on sustainable agriculture with a retail partner,"" said Steven Williams, Chief Executive Officer, PepsiCo Foods North America. ""Farmers are critical to our business, and many of the brands our consumers know and love rely on ingredients that we source straight from the farm. By joining forces with Walmart, we'll be empowering farmers through education, upfront investment in outcomes, peer coaching, and cost-sharing – and hopefully inspiring others to join us.""This collaboration is a key example of how Walmart is prioritizing purposeful collaborations to accelerate the adoption of regenerative practices in line with its goal to protect, restore or more sustainably manage 50 million acres of land and 1 million square miles of ocean by 2030 along with the Walmart Foundation.For more information about pep+, please click here.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. At this time, it's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.Story continuesLance M. FritzThank you, Rob, and good morning and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by our newly elected Independent Chair of the Board of Directors, Mike McCarthy, who will take a couple of minutes to address the announcements we made this morning regarding my successor and our Board. Mike, the floor is yours.Michael Robert McCarthyThanks, Lance. This morning, the Board of Directors announced that Jim Vena will be appointed the next Chief Executive Officer of Union Pacific. The Board has also appointed Jim to the Board of Directors. Jim brings a strong rail operations background at Union Pacific with over 40 years of experience. This includes 2 successful years as our Chief Operating Officer from 2019 to 2020. After a comprehensive search process, it was clear Jim's track record of operating excellence was unparalleled and he was the right candidate for the job. Jim will start as CEO on August 14, and we look forward to welcoming him back to Union Pacific. The Board also announced that Beth Whited will be appointed President of Union Pacific. Beth has over 35 years of experience at our company and has held leadership roles across multiple departments. Recently, she has led our strategy, sustainability and workforce resource teams with great success. Going forward, the operations, finance, marketing and sales, supply chain and technology functions will be report directly to Vena. Whited will report to Vena, and her responsibilities will include the strategy, workforce resources, sustainability, law, corporate relations and government affairs functions. In addition to these management changes, the Board is appointing 2 new Board members: Doyle Simons, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser; and John Wiehoff, former Chairman, President and CEO of C.H. Robinson. Both bring to our Board a wealth of skill sets, including operational expertise from leading large industrial public companies. As Lance indicated, as part of these changes, we are adopting a corporate governance best practice by splitting the role of company CEO and Board Chair. With my election, the Independent Chair, Director, Sheri Edison, will take over leadership with the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee. In addition, the Board has created a new committee, Safety and Service Quality, which will have responsibility to review, evaluate and monitor compliance with safety programs and provide oversight of the company's service performance. Director Jane Lute will lead this committee. The Board is very pleased to make these announcements today, which represent a continued commitment to Board refreshment to ensure that we have the right mix of skills and experience to oversee the company. We are confident that these new appointments set Union Pacific up for long-term value creation. Before I turn it back over to Lance, I would like to thank him for his leadership these past 8 years. His accomplishments are many and over the next few weeks, we will properly celebrate them. Most importantly though, his leadership has set our company up for great success for the years to come. Thank you, Lance. And I'll turn it back over to you.Lance M. FritzThanks, Mike. We appreciate your leadership throughout the process. And I'm pleased to welcome back Jim to Union Pacific, and I'm confident that the company has the right leaders to advance the hard work that's underway. Now let's turn to the business of the call and second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to 2022 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $2.93 per share. Our second quarter operating ratio of 63% was up 280 basis points versus 2022 primarily driven by lower revenue, inflationary pressures and the previously disclosed onetime ratification bonus payment. Throughout the quarter, we provided our customers with a more consistent and reliable service product while generally meeting the demand that was available to us. Eric will discuss in more detail the progress we've made, but the bottom line is that the actions we've taken to strengthen our crew resources are improving the railroad. We also acted during the quarter to increase the efficiency of our network by rightsizing our locomotive fleet using crews more efficiently and making sequential improvements in train length. We finished the quarter with our resources better aligned with current volumes. As you'll hear from Kenny, while several of our markets showed growth, consumer-facing markets remained soft and drove the volume decline. However, the strength of our business development efforts enabled us to mitigate the macro impact and outperform our peers. So let me turn it over to Kenny to provide more color on the business environment.Kenyatta G. RockerThank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter, volume was down 2% driven by weak market conditions in our premium and bulk business groups. Freight revenue declined 5% driven by lower fuel surcharges and a 2% decrease in volume. However, we generated solid core pricing gains in the quarter to help offset some of those challenges. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 3% compared to last year driven by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 1% decline in volume. Grain and grain products volume was up 1% due to increased demand and business wins for renewable diesel feedstocks coupled with strong shipments of domestic grain. A soft U.S. export grain market partially offset these gains. Fertilizer carloads decreased by 9% in the quarter due to an outage at a customer facility that reduced export potash shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced beer imports early in the quarter, but those shipments eventually improved by June. In addition, drought conditions from the prior growing season negatively impacted both fresh and can shipments. And lastly, coal and renewables volume was flat year-over-year. Low natural gas prices and reduced electricity demand from mild weather negatively impacted shipments, but that was offset by a favorable comparison to 2022. With our service improvements and additional resources, we are currently meeting available demand. Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was flat for the quarter driven by a 1% improvement in volume, offset by a 1% decline in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was up 2% year-over-year driven by increased plastic shipments, partially offset by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production levels and reduced housing demand. Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 2% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 13% year-over-year driven by challenging market conditions in housing and repair and remodel coupled with lower corrugated box demand. However, energy and specialized shipments were up 2% versus last year driven by strong business development and increased demand for LPG and petroleum products. Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 11% on a 4% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car decreased by 8%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue. Automotive volumes were positively driven by continued strength in OEM production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts. Domestic intermodal wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market driven by higher inventory and the shift in consumer behavior as people spend more towards services than goods. International shipments were down due to decreased imports on the West Coast. So turning to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities. There is uncertainty in our second half coal outlook as the inventories have been restocked, but extreme heat is driving up near-term demand and starting to push up natural gas prices. We expect near-term grain shipment to be challenged with tighter U.S. grain supply impacting volumes. However, with improved operations and recent rain improving new crop supply forecast, we remain optimistic about our opportunity to move incremental grain carloads in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect our forecast for biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to remain strong. We see solid market demand and continue to capture new business as production expands. Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is down in the back half of 2023. Demand for forest products will also remain below 2022 levels. And despite some good business development wins on the metal side, it has been offset by a weaker-than-expected market. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction with new business wins. And finally, for premium. We expect challenges in the intermodal market from continued inventory destocking, inflationary pressures and ongoing shift in consumer spending from goods to services. However, on the international side, we continue to outpace U.S. West Coast import market as customers shift more business to IPI. For automotive, we expect growth to continue driven by strong OEM production and high shippable ground count. So to wrap up, it's hard to say when the economy will begin to recover in certain sectors, but our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum in many of our commodities. The team remains focused on winning new business and has a strong pipeline of opportunities with a great track record for closing deals. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.Eric J. GehringerThank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. As always, safety remains job #1 at Union Pacific, and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Freight rail is the safest way to transport goods over land, and Union Pacific is doing its part to be even safer through ongoing investments in our network, employees, technology and communities. That is evidenced by our safety performance, which continues to show improvement. Through the first half of the year, our reportable derailment rate and personal injury rate both improved, a direct result of our enhanced training programs and strong safety culture of ownership and personal accountability. Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 10. This quarter, through the team's hard work, we made improvements both year-over-year and sequentially across key metrics that drive the customer experience. Freight car velocity improved 8% to 202 miles per day compared to the second quarter 2022. This improved fluidity and resiliency was on display as we exceeded 200 daily car miles for 10 consecutive weeks during the quarter. While the current business mix is a headwind, there remain opportunities for continued improvement. Trip plan compliance sizable 17 and 8-point year-over-year improvement in intermodal and manifest and auto TPC, respectively. Improved network fluidity as evidenced by faster freight car velocity, train velocity and lower terminal dwell drove those improvements. Turning to Slide 11 to review our network efficiency metrics. With the demand picture weaker, the team is taking action to rightsize resources to align with current volumes. For example, beginning in April, we took actions to remove locomotives from our active fleet, storing around 200 units through the quarter. While there is still room for progress, locomotive productivity improved 2% both sequentially and year-over-year even as our gross ton miles declined 1%. Although greater crew availability is supporting solid service metrics, the impact of our hiring can be seen in our workforce productivity. To date, we have graduated approximately 1,200 TE&amp;Y employees and have a strong pipeline of nearly 775 in training. These higher workforce levels, coupled with weaker volumes, resulted in a 5% decline in workforce productivity. However, with more crew resources, we were able to lower recrew rates and reduce our bar routes by roughly half during the quarter. We continue to drive productivity with train length as evidenced by our sequential improvement of 2%. While down 1% year-over-year, this is good progress when you consider the headwinds, soft intermodal volumes presented to our train length initiatives. There are many more opportunities ahead for improved efficiency of our railroad. From redeploying brake persons to improving fuel efficiency, growing train length and rightsizing our locomotive fleet, there is productivity to be captured. Wrapping up on Slide 12. The well-being and quality of life for our employees remains a top priority, and we continuously collect feedback, collaborate and look for solutions with our workforce. The historic agreements listed on Slide 12 represent the results of our work together. Let's talk through each one of them in detail. Starting with Paid Sick Leave. We now have ratified our tentative agreements with all 13 of our labor unions on this important quality-of-life initiative. The employee benefit is evident as they receive more paid time off to take care of themselves and their families. For the company, this definitely improves the attractiveness of our jobs but is additional labor expense that will need to be offset. Next, our Crew Consist agreement with Smart-TD provides greater scheduling flexibility and the ability to redeploy break or switch persons to work either in or outside the yard. More specifically, for our employees, it provides an expedited path for brakepersons to become conductors and ultimately engineers if they so desire. For the company, it allows us to now reduce brakepersons where the work does not require the third person, allowing us to partially offset short-term hiring demand. It also sets the stage to establish ground-based enhanced utility positions with fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments through scheduled shift work. Finally, TE&amp;Y Work-Rest provides engineers and conductors with a more predictable work schedule, which enhances the quality-of-life for our employees and their families. Currently, we have a ratified agreement with our engineers that provides an 11 days on, 4 days off work schedule, and we are currently negotiating work-rest with our conductors. For the company, this enables the railroad to better manage staffing levels as we receive a more predictable, available workforce. That reduces labor and failure costs, which combined support more consistent and reliable service, enabling long-term growth. We also believe it will improve our retention rate, reducing hiring expenses and loss productivity. Now these agreements come with a cost, which Jennifer will detail more later. As we implement them, we expect a larger training pipeline in the near term as well as elevated workforce levels in the future. When fully implemented, our current forecast is an additional 400 to 600 employees. Ultimately, the long-term benefit of these agreements is the positive impact on our employees and the service we provide for our customers. That enhanced service product will allow us to win in the marketplace. So to close, I would like to express my appreciation to both our customers for their support and the marketing and sales team for their continuous work to capture available demand and win in the new -- win new business. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.Jennifer L. HamannThanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk-down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 14, where we've outlined the major drivers. In the June 13th 8-K, we disclosed a onetime ratification payment related to our Smart-TD brakeperson agreement. That $67 million bonus increased our operating ratio 110 basis points and reduced our EPS $0.09.Falling fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs positively impacted our operating ratio 200 basis points and added $0.04 to EPS. While improved operations generally allowed us to meet demand during the quarter, that demand was softer and the combination of an elevated training pipeline, inflation and negative mix all impacted our core results. Below the line, we net to a $0.07 EPS reduction from lower Nebraska State tax rates in 2023, as was noted in that same June 8-K, and a large 2022 real estate sale.Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6 billion, down 5% versus last year on a 2% year-over-year volume decline. Included in that is a $34 million reduction in accessorials related to lower intermodal volume and faster equipment turns.Operating expense of $3.8 billion was flat, resulting in second quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, which is down 12% versus last year. Other income decreased $70 million driven by the 2022 real estate sale I mentioned earlier. Interest expense increased 7%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 14% versus 2022, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 12% decrease in earnings per share to $2.57.Now looking more closely at our second quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.6 billion, down 5% versus 2022. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 175 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $707 million was $269 million less versus last year. The impact of falling fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenues 425 basis points.The combination of price and mix in the quarter increased freight revenue 150 basis points. This gain reflects the strong pricing we secured while also recognizing some headwinds from certain coal and intermodal contracts where the pricing is more reflective of current market conditions. Mix in the quarter remained negative as fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments outweighed the positive impact of lower intermodal.Turning now to Slide 17 and a look at second quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased $177 million versus 2022 with nearly 40% of that amount reflecting the brakeperson agreement. Second quarter workforce levels increased to 4%. Although total transportation employees were up 7%, the active TE&amp;Y workforce is only up 1%, which is a result of our robust hiring and elevated training pipeline.Excluding the impact of the onetime bonus payment, cost per employee increased 5% in the second quarter, and we expect it to be up 3% to 4% for the full year. Both second quarter and full year cost per employee reflect the impact of that larger training pipeline as well as better crew efficiency, which are partially offsetting wage inflation. I'll provide more details on the impact of our new agreements here in just a bit.Fuel expense in the quarter increased 29% on a 29% decrease in fuel prices. Purchased services and materials expense increased 5% driven by inflation, partially offset by decreased subsidiary drayage expense and more moderate locomotive repair expenses as we stored locomotives in the quarter. Equipment &amp; Other Rents was up 8%, reflecting higher lease expense for new freight cars secured to support business volumes and lower equity income, slightly offset by lower car hire as we improve cycle times and move less volume. Other expense grew 6%, primarily related to increased environmental remediation accruals as well as persistently elevated casualty costs.Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows. Cash from operations in the first half of 2023 decreased to $3.9 billion from $4.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was $445 million of payments related to labor union agreements. These payments also impacted free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate.Year-to-date, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 200 -- excuse me, to 2022 levels at 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our 3 credit agencies.Wrapping up on Slide 19. As you've heard from the team, we're pleased that the service product is enabling us to meet available demand. Unfortunately, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets like intermodal and lumber remains soft. Additionally, the outlook for coal has weakened since the start of the year but with some near-term opportunities given the extreme heat.Although we still expect to outpace industrial production in certain markets, weak demand for consumer goods has pushed our full year volume outlook below current industrial production estimates, which are slightly positive. Unchanged is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. To date, we've made great progress repricing our business to reflect the impact of higher inflation, and that momentum will continue.As it relates to fuel prices, I should point out that the tailwind we've experienced these past 24 months is now expected to shift to a headwind both on the operating ratio and EPS front. Assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, this will likely represent a negative second half impact of around $0.50 per share.Eric provided some great context on our labor agreements. And although they clearly come with some upfront cost, we see opportunities as well. Starting with the sick leave agreements. Our current forecast is that they will add roughly $50 million to labor expense in the second half of 2023, which is reflected in the cost per crew numbers I quoted earlier. We view these costs as added inflationary pressures that we will reflect in our pricing.For the brakeperson agreement, we've already seen the impact of that upfront payment. Our expected payback period is roughly 2 years as it allows us to redeploy crew personnel, save on costly borrow-out positions, as well as reduce our current hiring needs. Implementation of the BLET work-rest agreement will start over the next month or so with completion likely in 2024. For this year, we estimate the work-rest implementation will cost upwards of $20 million.The challenge in putting a finer point on that estimate is both timing and forecasting employee behavior. We don't yet have an agreement with Smart-TD, and we are still working through some technology and logistics before we start the rollout. And while we certainly expect better availability, better service and more flexibility with our crew boards, providing more access to time off likely adds employees and expense. The exact math depends on how employees utilize this greater flexibility as well as how we translate better predictability into increased levels of productivity and service that ultimately drive profitable growth on our railroad.Looking at our 2023 capital allocation. Our capital plan remains $3.6 billion. We also plan to maintain our current dividend of $1.30 per quarter as reflected in our dividend announcement this morning. However, we have paused share repurchases and don't expect to be back in the market for the remainder of 2023.While there's no change to our long-term capital allocation strategy, which is first dollar into the business, industry-leading dividend payment and excess cash to shares, we recognize our cash flows are impacted in the current environment with volumes and costs.Wrapping up, we are well positioned to operate a better railroad in the second half of 2023 and for the long term, our strong fundamentals are unchanged and will allow us to generate significant value for our owners as team UP drives service, growth and improved profitability.So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.Lance M. FritzThank you, Jennifer. As you've heard from the team, the first half of this year has been about laying a foundation for future success. Key to that foundation is safety and the quality-of-life of our employees, and I'm pleased with the progress we've been making on both those fronts.As you heard from Eric, we continue to make the railroad safer, while improvements in our safety metrics are critical. More encouraging are the positive strides we're making in our safety culture. The team has great momentum across our safety programs, which gives me great pride as I step away.I'm also encouraged by the progress we've made to address quality-of-life issues with our craft professionals, reaching historic labor agreements around paid sick leave, crew redeployment and scheduled work. These agreements drive employee engagement and productivity to produce a better service product for our customers.As I wrap up time as CEO of Union Pacific, I'd like to express my deep appreciation to the Board and shareholders of UP for giving me the privilege of leading the company for the past 8 years. I'm proud of how the team has positioned Union Pacific to thrive for the years ahead, and I'm pleased to say that we provided great value all along the way.Union Pacific is truly a special place. It's full of hard-working, dedicated railroaders who embrace the daily task of Building America. It's been my greatest honor to lead this team. Their commitment to be the best for our communities, our customers, our investors and for each other is remarkable. 160-plus years of success began and continues with our exceptional employees. I can't wait to see what they accomplish next.Jennifer L. HamannThank you, Lance. And on behalf of the employees of Union Pacific, let me offer our gratitude and appreciation for your leadership. We wish nothing but the best for you and your family as you embark on the next chapter.Before we begin Q&amp;A, I'd like to lay out a couple of guidelines for the call. (Operator Instructions) Second, we understand that there's great interest in the leadership changes that were announced this morning, and we look forward to those discussions. However, today's call is to discuss our quarterly results. So please focus your questions on the business of the earnings call.So with that, Rob, we are ready for your first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today will come from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-CusicI just want to talk through intermodal. I know, there's obviously consumer weakness there. But is that -- I guess, the pace of the decline moderating for you some? And I guess, with sort of the improved service that you're starting to see in that interest back on the West Coast port, should we start to see or expect to see some of those business wins start to accelerate for you? Just any color just thinking that maybe intermodal starts to perform better for you in the face of even the consumer declines?Kenyatta G. RockerAllison, you look at it, I'll let you know, we're really staring down at consumer spending. And it's been flat last few months, maybe several months. But it's differentiated as you look at goods versus services, we're clearly seeing, and I talked about it in my opening remarks, less on the goods and more on the services.The other thing that we're watching is just what's happening with demand, and we're looking at that in terms of some of the contract rates would better flatten out in the spot rates that have inched up a little bit. The fact that we have a really strong intermodal service product is a benefit for us. We're encouraged as a company, I'm encouraged as the commercial leader that even though the imports have been down 23% year-to-date, we're only down a couple of percentage points.And talking to our customers, we also believe that they will be shifting a little bit more back to the West Coast port. That's going to be a gradual shift. That will be a little bit more throughout 2023 and probably into 2024. But clearly, we're positioned here for the upside.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.Jonathan B. ChappellI'm not sure this is for Jennifer or Kenny. But Jennifer, you mentioned in your comments you're making great progress in the repricing business to some of these inflationary headwinds that you're facing. Can you give us an idea as to, one, kind of where you stand in repricing the book of business to a lot of these new labor deals? And kind of two, just in a softer macro backdrop, how these conversations are going and your confidence in your ability to fully offset the cost?Jennifer L. HamannYes, Jon, thanks for that question. I'll start and then pitch it to Kenny. So just as a reminder, when you think about our book of business, call it, 25% or so is spot rates. You've got another, call it, 30%, 35% or so that is 1 year or less in duration types of contracts or arrangement, and the rest then are multiyear deals. So there is a cadence to which we're able to touch actively all of our business. Kenny, do you want to maybe talk about the market?Kenyatta G. RockerYes. Jon, the commercial team has done an excellent job articulating the need for some of the inflationary pressures even if you want to call it the labor pressure that are there and really inserting our service product along with those discussions.Now candidly, in a very pragmatic way, our customers empathize with that. They are taking the same price increases in their markets. So they understand what we need to accomplish. There's a tremendous amount of resources that were committed to on the CapEx side, which will help out with a consistent and reliable service. So we feel very good. There's full confidence and price and above inflation in making sure we cover those costs.OperatorOur next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.Christian F. WetherbeeCongrats, Lance on the next stage of your career here. I guess, wanted to take a minute and talk a little bit about sort of resources and where you think you are. I know, Eric, you talked about pulling some cost levers that were around locomotives and other assets. But Jennifer, what should we expect with head count as we move forward? And sort of when are you appropriately staffed for what you think the volume outlook might be, not just for this quarter but maybe the next several quarters?Jennifer L. HamannYes. So I'll maybe let Eric talk about how he feels about crew staffing levels. But just overall, in terms of our head count, we think as you look to the back half of the year, it's probably going to be, I'll call it, flattish or so from where we're at right now. We're continuing to hire and train and make sure that we've got a good robust pipeline so that we're able to serve our customers appropriately. But just from an absolute FTE basis, that's kind of how we see things in the back half.Eric J. GehringerYes. And just picking up from there, Chris. Clearly, what you've seen in our performance is that we have reduced the amount of hiring that we've been doing right now. We stay very connected with Kenny as in his outlook, both for the fourth quarter as well as 2024, and we're going to continue to adjust as we have to what that demand is.It's the same way I view the locomotive work that was accomplished during the quarter. And the team stored 200 locomotives. And if you actually look for now and this month, we're actually above 200. We're treating it the exact same way. See the demand that's out there, plan your resource base accordingly.Lance M. FritzWe should be crystal clear as well, Jennifer and Eric, Chris, that there's still work to be done. When we look into the third and fourth quarter, Eric outlined some of it in his prepared comments, but we are not yet volume-variable with what we're seeing in the marketplace. We took a step towards that in the second quarter. We got to keep taking steps in the third and fourth.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.Justin Trennon LongLance, congrats from my end as well. I wanted to ask a question about the outlook for the second half. You mentioned fuel being a headwind and in addition to that, the labor cost. Do you think EPS in the second half will be lower than the first half? And then maybe, Jennifer, you could comment on the run rate for these labor-related costs as we move into 2024. I'm just curious if we can take this $50 million to $70 million and annualize it or if that is expected to change?Lance M. FritzJennifer, why don't I start? We're not going to provide some incremental or new guidance as regards earnings into the back half. But Jennifer, you did a good job of outlining what the headwinds are, and why don't we unpack that a little bit?Jennifer L. HamannYes. I mean, certainly, the one headwind we did size for you is the $0.50 impact, the negative year-over-year impact we expect to see on EPS from fuel in the third and fourth quarters. In terms of moving into 2024, so if you think about that $50 million from the sick leave agreements that I mentioned, most of those agreements were really effective in the second half. We had our non-ops that started a little bit in the first half. So I think you can think about that as being something that will carry over and repeat itself in the first half of 2024.Beyond that, in terms of the implementation of work-rest, we're really reluctant to -- and really, it would be difficult for us to size that more precisely, because it is going to depend on the timing of how we roll that out as well as the employee behavior that we see with that. And so that's something that we'll just keep you updated, but I want to make sure you do understand that, that will be a bit of a headwind. But as we get greater clarity of that as we go through our rollout and start that rollout and obviously, we still need to get Smart-TD done as well, we'll be in conversation about that.Lance M. FritzSo Justin, I think as we look into the back half of this year, improving productivity, the hiring pipeline tones down a little bit, but we're still hiring. It probably looks like year-over-year about equal, I think, is what Jennifer was saying.Not sure what's going on in the marketplace. So we got to -- we've got to do everything we can to capture all the business that's available to us. And then fuel is going to be a real headwind in the back half.Offsetting that, we get a tailwind from implementing the brakeperson agreement. And as we implement the work-rest schedule, I am confident that generates both productivity and service product improvement. The issue is timing and magnitude.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.Brandon Robert OglenskiLance, congrats on career here. And I guess, I know you guys want to ask about the quarter, but just looking back, Lance, over your course of being at Union Pacific, what do you think went really right? And what do you think maybe could have been done better to keep track maybe with potentially more volume growth looking back?And maybe looking forward, what do you think are the biggest challenges or opportunities for the industry, maybe not even just UNP? Is it technology, is it regulation, is it M&amp;A? Would love to get your thoughts.Lance M. FritzYes, Brandon, thank you for that question. And we'll try to keep this to be the only question on that. So I'll try to make the answer fulsome. In terms of what am I proud of, what did I think we got right as a team, one is I love the team that we've assembled. It's world-class. I love the work that we've done on sustainability. I love the fact that we are an inclusive workforce. You can see it in our Board. You can see it on our management team.I like the progress that we've made on safety. We've got more to do there. And I love the fact that we transitioned from our previous transportation model and way of running the railroad to a PSR model that's a better service product for our customers.In terms of what we needed to do better, we were not consistent and reliable through my 8.5 years of serving as the Chairman, President and COO. And that needs to be remedied. As we look into the future, that's exactly what we need to continue to do. We've got a strategy, serve, grow, win together, that's built off the foundation of consistent and reliable service.I am confident, we're oriented, organized and capable of doing that. We've got to prove it to our customers. Because Brandon, our customers tell us, as we demonstrate reliability, there's more of their order book available to us, plus there's more market participants that will start doing business with us. That's the unlock for growth. And growth is the unlock for significant value creation in the future for everybody, for all of our stakeholders.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.Ravi ShankerAgain, from me as well, congrats, Lance, on a great career. Just on the volume guide itself, can you confirm just how much that kind of volume outlook did move? Because you did -- you're now going to be kind of below a raised benchmark. So just trying to get a sense of kind of how much that did move.And also, is industrial production the right benchmark for your kind of volume growth in the long term just given the consumer exposure here? Or do we have to look at some combination of IP plus GDP?Lance M. FritzJennifer, do you want to start that?Jennifer L. HamannYes, I can start it. So you raised a good point, Ravi. I mean, we do think looking backwards certainly that industrial production has been a better gauge. But you're right, we have great franchise diversity, which we've talked to and Kenny mentioned too. And with the growing intermodal portfolio, there are certainly components of that. But it's really driven by consumer spending, and a lot of that consumer spending comes from industrial production. So it's hard to really separate from that.But in terms of what's changed from where we started the year, certainly, coal is something that with natural gas prices falling as it did late January, early February, that certainly took a big chunk of that demand away from us. Now you've heard us talk about the heat and you're seeing that, you're seeing maybe a little bit of inflection in natural gas prices. So we're watching that.The other piece, though, is on that consumer side. Onboarding a new intermodal customer coming into the year, we expected that to be a big tailwind to our volumes. And just the way that, that consumer spending and consumer goods purchases has dropped, that's just had a really outsized impact.Kenyatta G. RockerAll I'll say is that we're looking at consumer spending by the week. And I feel very encouraged that we have onboarded over the last couple of years a couple of transformative customers on to our domestic intermodal network. And so as we see that movement move up, we're going to be in a great position. And so that's encouraging for us as a company.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.Brian Patrick OssenbeckFirst, just wanted to follow up on pricing to the labor inflation. Do you think getting rate is enough to offset those costs? Should you need to get some productivity benefits from the work-rest, the brakemen and then possibly, even the utility rule? And then just for Kenny, can you just comment more about price mix? You mentioned specifically the coal and intermodal pricing were resetting lower in the quarter. Does that continue throughout the rest of the year? You can give some parameters in terms of how to think about that plus mix in the back half.Lance M. FritzKenny, why don't I start with the -- what about the agreements and getting price and productivity out of them. The short answer, Brian, is we are confident that we can continue to price above inflation. We've just seen a few agreements like paid sick leave add to the inflation in our comp and benefits. And Kenny's team is tasked now to get out there and make sure that we recoup that.In terms of productivity, the brakeperson agreement is just a clear path on productivity. We can reduce 3 people to 2 people on crews where we don't need 3 people, and we can either redeploy them or lower our hiring demands. So that clearly, just in that one example -- there are other examples like in work-rest, Brian, we'll be able to get productivity out of that.Today, there's a percentage of our workforce when they're called to take a train, they are not available to us. And we don't know that before we call them. And that creates failure cost and disruption in the network. I'm going to presume, and I think the experience where work-rest schedules are in place, that unpredictability dropped dramatically. When that happens, we get better the utilization of our assets and we lower failure costs from the network. So the only question for us is order of magnitude and when as we implement.Kenyatta G. RockerSo yes, a couple of things here. Let's just take hold for first up. Yes. When you've heard us talk about this, we do have a couple of mechanisms that are in place that allow us and our customers to be competitive with natural gas prices. One of the things that we have seen out there is the fact that there has been a little slight uptick in terms of demand based on the extreme heat that we've seen. We've seen that also impact again in the near term natural gas prices out there. So we're seeing more demand out there.We're working closely with Eric and his team as we speak to add more sets and add more inventory into the network. And we're looking at the [4] curves as you just see how long that will last. So we're always looking at that, and we're looking at that by the week.Switching to domestic intermodal on the pricing side. We like the fact that we have our customers that are competitive in the marketplace and that we're competitive against truck. Some of those mechanisms will go up, I think, tightened in some, doing a loop market like where we are now, it might move down a little bit. But the key is to make sure that we can capture the volume against truck and make sure that we're competitive.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital.Fadi ChamounCongratulations, Lance. Question on the opportunity for volume. Like if you think about a 0 GDP environment over the next, say, 12 months, what can service improvement deliver in terms of growth? Where are maybe some of the verticals you think that you can make a difference in the service level and ultimately start to see more idiosyncratic opportunities to grow the business?Kenyatta G. RockerYes, Fadi, thanks for the question. Let's just walk through -- if you look at our outlook slide, and I'll supplement that with a few more specifics on our bio diesel, the renewable diesel market, we've got 7 different facilities on us. We're going to land another facility here by the end of the year. We're very encouraged by that. That's a key part of our growth strategy. And we mentioned that a couple of years ago, during Investor Day, very proud of our commercial team for securing that.Construction, our rock business, for example, those are areas where Eric's team is just delivering great service, and it's showing up in terms of carloads. We're adding a few more sets there. We're seeing more carloads that are coming on because of that, and some of that is market-related. There's just more infrastructure that's out there.If you talk about the service product, we look at auto parts coming out of Mexico. We've seen a pretty fast and upcoming growing EV producer that we're growing with on the auto parts side that we're excited about. We've secured a new automotive OEM on our line back in the spring that has brought business to us. That same OEM will be bringing on business in the first quarter. So we're pretty excited there.And then, kind of last but not least, I'll just say that overall, the team has been engaged on bringing new business in different ways. We have a new industrial park that's going to be landing on us in the Buckeye, Arizona area. So that's great. And we've got a customer that will be doing reusable plastics, so just you think about the ESG connection. So we can create our own business development with the service that I mentioned with Eric, and we're excited about it.Lance M. FritzAnd it's proven, Kenny, your BD pipeline is up, what?Kenyatta G. RockerIt's up around 20% to 25%. So the team is just doing a fabulous job, going out there and expanding the market better.Lance M. FritzAnd that's in a down volume market.Kenyatta G. RockerThat's in a downmarket. And -- so we're pumped up about it.Lance M. FritzThat's good.Fadi ChamounAnd I'm surprised you didn't mention intermodal as being one of the opportunities that service gets better. Is this because the truck market competitiveness right now? You need a little bit of support there? Or is there more to it than that?Kenyatta G. RockerOkay. Well, you're going to get me riled up today. So first of all, we talked about a couple of transformative wins that we feel good about. I'll tell you, as the management team, bringing on Inland Empire, which is a new product, bringing on a new Port Houston service product that Eric has given us with 5 new lanes, bringing on Twin Cities. Absolutely, we feel good about domestic intermodal. At some point, you need the demand to be there. What you're hearing me say is that we're prepared as that demand comes on. And we're adding new products, we're adding new services, we're adding new customers. We're excited.Lance M. FritzKenny, at the risk of making this drag on too long, you should mention Falcon Premium too.Kenyatta G. RockerSo let me back up and just say there's been a lot of debate out there, Lance, in the marketplace. And we feel very good about the service products that we have with Falcon Premium. On a broader sense, there are other Class 1s associated with that. So it's not just one Class 1. It's the other Class 1s that we're interacting with too, that we feel good about.We've got a shorter route structure. We've got a better schedule. We've got the relationship with the customers. Eric and his team are continuously improving that service product. So we're encouraged how that looks in the future.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank.Amit Singh MehrotraLance, congrats all your success. Wish you the best. I guess, Eric and Jennifer, I know borrow-outs have been pretty expensive. And I think last time we checked, you had like 250 borrow-outs in the network. Can you just give us an update on that? It feels like maybe that's an opportunity over the next 6 to 9 months.And just generally, in terms of non-fuel costs, it feels like the network is running a little bit heavy on non-fuel costs. I know, there's obviously cost inflation and labor inflation, some idiosyncratic things. But as maybe the volume comes back and you can become much more volume-variable, is there an opportunity to kind of hold the line on the non-fuel cost structure given some of the positive things that you can do on the borrow-outs and kind of other cost items that are proving more stubborn right now?Eric J. GehringerYes. Thank you for the question. Let's back up in time, as we came into the year when we think about our first quarter earnings report, we were talking about borrow-outs. In the context of while we were making great progress in our hiring, we still have pockets of the system, specifically about 7 locations, where we were utilizing borrow-outs because of the difficulty to hire.Now in any given year, there's some level of borrow-outs used even in just dealing with seasonality, for example, the grain harvest that comes in the fall. If you look at the quarter, what we've reported is that we've taken our borrow-out count down by 50%, approximately. Now that is a process that continues. As we look for volume to continue to grow, we have those as options. But as we're looking every week, to your point, to control our cost, those are ones that we adjust literally on a weekly basis.There may be a place as we fast-forward 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, where you may use them and very small numbers. But our goal is to reduce our borrow-outs as quickly as we possibly can.As far as the non-fuel cost, it follows the same recipe that we've shared before. One, we just finished talking about it, which is how we think about our labor costs and ensuring that we're being conscious of that. Two, you go to your next expensive cost or at least outside of fuel, is you're going to look at your locomotive fleet. The reduction that we've made in the quarter is a strong move in the right direction. The reduction we've been made in July is another strong move on top of that, and we look forward to reporting to that in future quarters. So all eyes on we want to grow the business, and we need to be volume-variable until we see more of that growth coming.Jennifer L. HamannYes. And Amit, just to build on what Eric is saying, there is, if you look across all of our cost categories, setting depreciation aside, we know we have opportunities within all of those to be more efficient. As we continue to improve cycle times, that has a very direct flow-through in terms of our car hire expenses on the purchased services and materials side.Eric mentioned the locomotives, but there's other opportunities we have in there to work on our cost. And even comp and benefits with some of the headwinds that we know we have, there's opportunities to be more productive and use that crew base more efficiently.And to your point, volume can certainly be a friend when it comes to the cost structure. But I think the fact that you've seen us make some progress as volumes are going down, and you saw us build train length even as volumes came down and in particular, intermodal volume, those are the other things that we're going to keep working on here -- well, always, but certainly in the back half of the year to continue to drive better efficiency and get better alignment between the resources and the cost structure and the volumes that we're moving.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.Bascome MajorsLance, as you wrap up your 8 years as UP's Chairman, President, and CDO, how do you expect the push and pull of the senior decision-making process between marketing operations and HR change with those roles split between 3 people and Beth elevated from just leaving the HR and sustainability efforts into that newly stand-alone President position?Lance M. FritzYes, Bascome, thanks for the question. First, you got to note, Jim Vena is our CEO. He runs the company. That reports to Jim. So I don't anticipate any meaningful dislocations or push-pull created by org structure. And having said that, there are some natural creative tension in the business all the time. There's creative tension between the operating team and the commercial team. There can be creative tension between the team that is controlling versus the team that's spending.Just -- you can name any number. The most important thing is we've got a fabulous operating executive joining us as our CEO. He's got a great track record, and he's going to be laser-focused on making sure that we're providing the best service product to our customers so that we can translate it into growth. He's going to do a very good job of making sure the team works together.We're working well together today. I anticipate we'll be working well together a month from now. And Beth's role is going to be making sure that she's supporting all of that effort effectively through workforce resources, through the work we do with communities, through the work we do in DC. So I anticipate better, not worse, as we move forward.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.Kenneth Scott HoexterCongrats Lance team and the Board on the next steps and on naming Jim as CEO. So many moving parts with the labor agreements. Obviously, Jenn ran through some of the cost side from the pay increase of last year to what you're now adding on after the main contracts. Maybe -- can you take a minute, walk us through some of the benefits that you see?And I presume these are all Union Pacific add-ons. Maybe differentiate what is UP add-on versus the industry. And then just thoughts on your outlook. I think you removed the operating ratio from your target. Is there a thought on the scale that you want to put together on costs? Or are we just leaving that off all together?Jennifer L. HamannYes. So I'll start off, Ken. So when we did our 8-K in June, we took the operating ratio improvement off the table for the year, and that hasn't changed. Certainly, you heard us talk about some of the headwinds that we have. So we are not -- with the addition of the labor expenses, volumes moving away from us and then obviously, some fuel headwinds relative to OR in the back half of the year, we don't expect year-over-year improvement.Our task, and I kind of touched on this a little bit, with the question from Amit, is to get better from where we sit today. And I'm not going to forecast what our OR is going to be in the back half of the year, but we're going to work really hard to improve each and every day. And that's both in terms of being more productive with that cost structure as well as going out and selling in the marketplace and doing all we can to drive profitability on that side.I don't know, Eric, do you want to...Eric J. GehringerYes. And on the agreement side, so if we start with sick days, the opportunity that Lance mentioned [obvious reinforce] is we see the opportunity to improve the attractiveness of our jobs. And as a result of that, that can have a positive impact on how we do our hiring.If you go to the brakeperson deal, clearly, the biggest opportunity there is to reduce brakeperson labor in line with where the jobs are no longer needed and also allows us to partially offset some of our hiring in the short term. And of course, we get the benefit of establishing a ground-based enhanced utility position.And as Jennifer pointed out, the payback period on that is approximately 2 years. And if you look right now, we're about 60% of the way through that implementation. And then certainly on the 11 and 4 scheduled work, it really brought us down to improved availability, as Lance pointed out, and more efficiently managing our staff levels with more latitude on how we do that under this new agreement.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.Scott H. GroupBest of luck to you, Lance. Jennifer, I just wanted to just make sure I understood the answer to that last question. Are you -- so relative to like the 62% adjusted OR in Q2, are you not -- you're just not giving any color? Or are you saying it's probably going to get worse, the OR second half versus that 62%? I'm just not sure what you're trying to message there.And then just Kenny, CN last night was just -- talked about raising their expectations for the U.S. grain -- upcoming U.S. grain harvest just with some better rain recently. Just your thoughts on how you think about the grain harvest in your territory going forward?Jennifer L. HamannYes. So going back to -- you're really asking a sequential question. And again, I -- we had a 63% reported OR. If you're stripping out the brakeperson agreement, that was 1.1 points in the quarter. If you look at what we have done historically as a company, you tend to see some of your better margins in the third quarter, tends to go up a little bit then in the fourth quarter when you're just thinking about kind of that normal seasonality.We are going to work to make sequential improvement. I'm not telling you that we're making sequential improvement, but that is the task that has to be ahead of us. We have to work to improve the cost structure. And we've already made some progress. I think you certainly saw that. I know, it's a little bit of a messy quarter with all that was going on in it. But when you strip some of the noise out, there was -- particularly when you're comparing first quarter to second quarter, we did make gains, not year-over-year but sequentially, we did make some gains there. So I think that's the way to think about it into the back half of this year.Kenyatta G. RockerSo Scott, I'd tell you, we look at the weekly crop report and, call it 5, maybe 6 weeks ago, it wasn't looking great. And since then, we've had rain in areas that we serve and participate in. So it's looking much better.You heard in my comments that we think there is an opportunity for incremental grain in the fourth quarter. And so we're steering that down and working with Eric's team to make sure we can capture it.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC.Walter Noel SpracklinBest of luck there, Lance, on the future. Just a question here -- wrap up here on coal. I know you'd indicated that, that was an area of discrepancy from where you were looking at before. Really on the -- the revenue per carload revenue per RTM, that's taken a notable step-down. And I know your peers have talked a lot about -- you talked about a 15% decline in their rates on coal. Now a lot of that is tied to export nat, which is not in your mix, but you did see a similar type of step-down in cents per RTM. Just wondering if that's something that you expect to continue for the foreseeable future. What's driving it? What could make it change up or down from this point going forward?Jennifer L. HamannYes. So Walter, we did mention that in my prepared remarks that, that was a bit of a headwind. And you've heard us talk before that we do have a portion of our coal contracts that have some mechanisms that link that pricing to natural gas pricing. And what's happened with natural gas pricing, that certainly is flowing through in terms of some of the rates. We did that similar to intermodal in terms of keeping competitiveness for those players that are dispatching into the grid, keeping them competitive. And we're continuing to ship coal. Still profitable for us, but there is some pricing differentials there.So it really depends on how you see the rest of the year playing out in terms of how that's going to look. But if you just compare last year's nat gas prices to where we're at this year, that tells you there's going to be some ongoing pressure there.Lance M. FritzYes. I think the differentiation there is sequential versus year-over-year, and year-over-year is going to continue to see some pressure. Sequential, we've seen as much pressure as we're going to see.Walter Noel SpracklinSo it's the kind of flat from this point going forward?Jennifer L. HamannIt should be. I mean, obviously, watch natural gas prices.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.Jason H. SeidlFirst off, Lance, good luck in the future, and congrats to both Jim and Beth, if they're listening in. Some quick things. I wanted to look a little bit about regulation. We've seen the FRA now is looking for a public comment period on train weights and lengths. Wanted to know if you guys think this is sort of a precursor for more regulation from them.And two, maybe if you could talk a little bit about anything anticipated on reciprocal switching. And lastly, squeezing in here, Jennifer, when was the last time you guys didn't repurchase shares in the quarter?Lance M. FritzJennifer, do you want to go first, then I'll take the others?Jennifer L. HamannYes. So I would go back to second and third quarter of 2020 when the pandemic hit and there was such a drop in volumes. We paused our share repurchases then for at least a couple -- I'm pretty sure for the full second quarter, part of the third quarter, I think, is when we restarted that. So we manage the share repurchase piece with our excess cash. And that's always been the flexible part of our shareholder return, and that's how we're managing it today.Lance M. FritzYes. And Jennifer, we've been crystal clear that we turbocharged our excess cash by using the capacity of our balance sheet. And that capacity now has been largely used, and it's all about growing cash from operations and operating income at this point.Jennifer L. HamannExactly, Lance. And obviously, with some of the earnings pressures we're facing this year, that's not giving us that incremental capacity we've seen.Lance M. FritzSo Jason, talking about what's going on in Congress and at the STB in Congress, the Rail Safety Act, we've been crystal clear about things in there that we think are appropriate. Like there should be some additional regulation and laws regarding the preparedness of emergency responders, the information that's at their disposal. We believe the same is true on tank car standards. There's an opportunity to pull forward tank car standard improvements.And we also think there's room for regulation to step into wayside detection. We've done a ton of things in wayside detection voluntarily. It is not regulated. And if it were to be regulated appropriately, that makes some sense.There's some things in the Rail Safety Act that don't make sense like coupling train size with safety. On our railroad, mainline and siding derailments are down 25% plus, while train size is up 20% over the last, call it, 4 years. There's just no correlation in our experience between safety and train size.And likewise, there's no correlation anywhere in the world between train crew size and safety. That should be left to collective bargaining and what technology enables. So as we look at Congress, that's what we're thinking about. As we look at the STB, as we've said before, we help them understand how the railroad industry works, how our reinvestment works. And when it comes to reciprocal switch or forced open access, we help them understand that, that would have a real negative impact on investment. It would not improve service product, and they should be very, very careful as they think about whether or not that should be implemented and how to implement it.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.Thomas Richard WadewitzLance, wanted to wish you well in the next thing you do, retirement, whatever it is. Let's see. I guess, one just clarification. I think, Kenny, you commented earlier on intermodal yields are -- 3Q, are we expecting more sequential pressure on revenue per car in intermodal in 3Q? So that -- just a clarification.And then the broader question really -- when we look at the industry, I think historically, there was opportunity from productivity and price to improve margins. Certainly, UP did that in a massive way over, I don't know, 15 years, right? But it just seems like there's this inflation in the cost base and pricing's good, but not enough. So do you think it's fair to look forward and say, look, margin improvement is really about volume and without volume, you're -- maybe you have a tough time to improve the margin? And I think that seemed to be true maybe for industry, not just for UP, but I don't know if you have thoughts on that. And then maybe the clarification on intermodal.Lance M. FritzYes, Tom, let me start with your essential question about the 3 legs of the stool. We've forever talked about, we drive margin improvement through productivity, price and the benefit of volume. And to your point, we've leaned heavily on productivity and price historically. And we said we're in a transition where we're going to have to lean more heavily on volume.But that's not going to be the only leg of that three-legged stool, Tom, when you -- it's still true. While inflation got on us quick, the way our contracts and our business relationships are set, it takes us a while to recoup that inflation through price. Kenny's team has been crystal clear that they own the requirement to do that, and they're following through. But it's going to take a little while.And on productivity, like we just demonstrated this quarter, we created a new agreement, makes all the sense in the world. It came with a 70 -- roughly $70 million price tag immediately. Implementing it is going to get the payback and will be paid back in about 2 years. So Tom, the opportunity for productivity, price and volume to still drive margin improvement exists. We're in kind of a unique environment right now regarding timing. And we are, for sure, going to have to rely on volume more heavily going forward.Kenyatta G. RockerYes. Just a short answer. No, we're not expecting increased pricing pressures on that intermodal side of the house.Thomas Richard WadewitzOkay. So you think stable revenue per car 3Q versus 2Q?Kenyatta G. RockerThat's how you should be thinking about it.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel.Benjamin Joel NolanSo Kenny, you mentioned the Falcon Express a little bit ago. I'm curious if you have any early takes. Any -- how are things thus far developing the way that they thought you would or you thought they would? Or any early indications that -- of how you're expecting it to play out over the back half of the year?Kenyatta G. RockerI think you're asking, have we seen any success stories? And yes, we've had some early wins. Of course, the focus is over the road. I mean, that's the size of the prize. Rail is a very small part of that traffic that's moving out of Mexico or into Mexico. As I also said, as we continue to improve the speed and consistency there, we expect to make more inroads.Benjamin Joel NolanOkay. And so far, as expected?Kenyatta G. RockerYes. I mean, we're getting more reception from customers that are open to opening their books and giving us a shot, for sure.OperatorOur next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.David Scott VernonLance, congratulations and good luck. So Eric, with the 400 to 600 heads that we need to add in for the part time off -- or paid time-off agreements, how many of those people are going to be on property by the end of this year? And then, how should we think about reconciling that with the -- a flat head count number from 2Q? Are we making reductions in operations? Or is it coming out of other areas?Jennifer L. HamannYes. So I'll actually jump in on that one. So it is -- when you think about the 400 to 600 incremental that we talked about from the labor agreements, that's incremental from what we would have otherwise been staffing at a given volume level. So that is completely consistent with and taken into account with when we also say, as we look at head count levels now to the end of the year, we think not a whole lot of change. So...Lance M. FritzSo Jennifer, it's for all agreements.Jennifer L. HamannAnd it's for all agreements, which, again, we're going to be implementing over not just the back half of this year but well into 2024.Eric J. GehringerI think we also pointed out in our commentary that, that number is going to be highly impacted by the behavior that comes from these agreements. And we're not ready today to say exactly what that will look like. We'll continue to look to it, though.Jennifer L. HamannAbsolutely.Lance M. FritzBut he had the back half of his question there, which was about offsets and...Eric J. GehringerYes. The offsets really haven't changed from the ones that I answered a few moments ago. They really focused on the availability on the 11 and 4, and they focus on the brakeperson about actually removing brakepersons off of positions that are no longer needed.David Scott VernonSo if you were to say like how much of the 400 to 600 is in this year versus coming into next year, is it a quarter, is it half? Is there a way to directionally sort of indicate how much is going to be in this year?Jennifer L. HamannAgain, it does depend on what the behavior is. But there will be some amount, maybe 1/4 to 1/2. That's probably not a bad estimate. Sick leave, obviously, that part we have fully done now. So any heads that we think that we need to add for that, that's done.Obviously, we get offsets this year too with the brakeperson agreement. So there's a bit of a netting effect. And then it really is pace and timing of the BLET work-rest, getting Smart-TD. And of course, we will -- because it's really the training piece of it, right? So we're going to need to -- for BLET, we need to put more engineers in the training pipeline. And with that, you need to continue to hire some conductors. So there will be some portion, 50% might be at the max side, I would say, but probably somewhere in there is a safe bet.Lance M. FritzAnd Jennifer, I think you had said this, but your total guidance sequentially for the back half labor being flattish includes all that.Jennifer L. HamannYes, it absolutely includes all of that.OperatorOur final question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.Jordan Robert AlligerMore of an operational question. Curious, trip plan compliance, where do you think that needs to go both at the manifest and intermodal level, but specifically on intermodal. Is the way to think about intermodal conversion accelerating tied to a certain level of trip plan compliance for that? And if so, where do customers really take note and you start to see an acceleration of market share gains?Eric J. GehringerYes. Thank you for the question, Jordan. So when you -- we've been very consistent that when you think about the intermodal TPC, you're talking about a number that starts with an 8. And when you're thinking about manifest in autos, it starts with the 7. Now that's highly informed and continues to be evolving. We went through a very large engagement with our customer base through Kenny's team towards the back end of last year that is informed this year and how we think about that, more specifically to segments within those customers.Now that work continues because (inaudible) and as we've reinforced before, we know that our customers are sensitive, in fact, very sensitive to our service. That's why we're encouraged by the progress we made. And in no way are we saying that our service is where it needs to be now. It was a great step in the right direction. We've got more work to do.Lance M. FritzThank you, Jordan, and thank you all for your questions, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest and your ownership in Union Pacific, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Take care.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you.]"

581,2afb4212-8167-3aae-8b9a-6d4e3aa22bd7,UNP,2023-07-27,New labor agreements expected to cost Union Pacific millions,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/labor-agreements-expected-cost-union-224754699.html,1690411674,STORY,['UNP'],"[Union Pacific released its second-quarter 2023 earnings results on Wednesday. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)How much new sick leave and scheduling agreements might cost Union Pacific was one of the main themes of UP’s earnings call Wednesday to discuss second-quarter 2023 results.UP has ratified sick leave agreements with all 13 of its labor unions, according to Eric Gehringer, executive vice president of operations, who said providing sick leave will result in an additional labor expense but it should also improve job attractiveness.Providing sick leave could add roughly $50 million in labor expenses in the second half of 2023, according to UP CFO Jennifer Hamann, who said these costs are being viewed as added inflationary pressures that will be reflected in UP’s pricing.There are other potential labor costs on the horizon as well. UP has a crew consist agreement with the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers — Transportation Division (SMART-TD) that Gehringer described in prepared remarks as providing greater scheduling flexibility while also enabling the redeployment of brake or switch persons to work either in or outside the yard. It should also provide an expedited path for brake persons to become conductors and ultimately engineers if they choose to do so.“For the company, it allows us to now reduce brake persons where the work does not require the third person, allowing us to partially offset short-term hiring demand,” Gehringer said. “It also sets the stage to establish ground-based enhanced utility positions with fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments through scheduled shift work.”UP also has a ratified agreement with its locomotive engineers that provides a work schedule of 11 days on and four days off. It is continuing to negotiate a work-rest agreement with its train conductors.These agreements should eventually add an additional 400 to 600 employees to UP’s roster, according to Gehringer.“For the company, this enables the railroad to better manage staffing levels as we receive a more predictable, available workforce. That reduces labor and failure costs, which combined support more consistent and reliable service, enabling long-term growth. We also believe it will improve our retention rate, reducing hiring expenses and lost productivity,” Gehringer said.Story continuesThe SMART-TD brake person agreement resulted in a one-time ratification payment of $67 million that increased UP’s operating ratio by 110 basis points and reduced its earnings per share by 9 cents, according to Hamann, while the implementation of the work-rest agreement with the locomotive engineers could cost around $20 million.UP is uncertain what labor costs could be should a work-rest agreement be reached and ratified for train conductors.“The challenge in putting a finer point on that estimate is both timing and forecasting employee behavior. We don’t yet have an agreement with SMART-TD, and we are still working through some technology and logistics before we start the rollout,” Hamann said. “And while we certainly expect better availability, better service and more flexibility with our crew boards, providing more access to time off likely adds employees and expense. The exact math depends on how employees utilize this greater flexibility as well as how we translate better predictability into increased levels of productivity and service that ultimately drive profitable growth on our railroad.”But despite the increased labor costs, “we get a tailwind from implementing the brake person agreement,” UP President and CEO Lance Fritz said. “And as we implement the work-rest schedule, I am confident that it generates both productivity and service product improvement. The issue is timing and magnitude.”UP’s outlook for the remainder of 2023Serving as a backdrop to the discussion on labor costs was UP’s other announcement Wednesday morning that it has named former COO Jim Vena as its new CEO and promoted Beth Whited, its current sustainability and strategy EVP, to serve as the Class I railway’s president. The changes will become effective Aug. 14. Vena will replace outgoing Fritz.As for the second half of 2023, higher natural gas prices and extreme heat in the near term are supporting UP’s outlook for coal volumes, and the railroad is also “optimistic” about opportunities to move grain carloads in the fourth quarter because of new crop supply forecasts and UP’s improved rail operations, said Kenny Rocker, executive vice president for marketing and sales.Shipments of renewable diesel and their feedstocks are also expected “to remain strong,” he said, while UP’s industrial segment is mixed. The forecast for industrial production is down in the back half of 2023 and forest products demand is below 2022 levels, but there is some continued strength in construction.Meanwhile, inflationary pressures and the shift in consumer spending from goods to services are likely to put pressure on UP’s international intermodal volumes, he said.“It’s hard to say when the economy will begin to recover in certain sectors, but our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum in many of our commodities,” Rocker said in prepared remarks. “The team remains focused on winning new business and has a strong pipeline of opportunities with a great track record for closing deals.”Yet despite the potential headwinds in the second half of 2023, UP is preparing its offerings for when demand returns for segments such as domestic intermodal, according to Rocker. These offerings include a new service product at Port Houston and intermodal capacity expansions near Twin Cities, Minnesota, and the Inland Empire in Southern California.UP is also upbeat about its Falcon Premium service with Canadian railway CN (NYSE: CNI) and Ferromex, which Rocker says has a shorter route structure.“We feel good about domestic intermodal. At some point, you need demand to be there. What you’re hearing me say is that we’re prepared as that demand comes on. And we’re adding new products, we’re adding new services, we’re adding new customers. We’re excited,” Rocker said.UP’s net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $1.6 billion, or $2.57 per diluted share, down from net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.93 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2022. Financial results for the second quarter of 2023 include the previously disclosed $67 million labor expense and a $73 million income tax benefit, UP (NYSE: UNP) said.Operating revenue fell 5% year over year to $6 billion on reduced fuel surcharge revenue, lower volumes and an unfavorable business mix, partially offset by core pricing gains, UP said. Volumes were also down by 2%.Operating income slipped 12% to $2.2 billion, while operating ratio was 63%, compared with OR of 60.2% for the second quarter of 2022. Investors sometimes use OR to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved health.“The results this quarter were impacted by softening consumer markets, inflation, a one-time labor expense, and increased workforce levels,” Fritz said in the Wednesday news release. “The entire team remains focused on maintaining a solid service product while taking steps to recapture lost productivity and lay a strong foundation for sustainable future success. We took actions throughout the second quarter to drive greater network fluidity and provide our customers with better service. We finished the quarter with resource levels more aligned with demand, as we stored excess locomotives, improved recrew rates, and reduced borrowed-out employees.”On UP’s earnings call, Gehringer confirmed that the railway has been taking action to “rightsize resources to align with current volumes,” through steps such as removing locomotives from the active fleet and storing 200 units in the second quarter.“There are many more opportunities ahead for improved efficiency of our railroad. From redeploying brake persons to improving fuel efficiency, growing train length and rightsizing our locomotive fleet, there is productivity to be captured,” Gehringer said in the prepared remarks.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Vena returning to Union Pacific as new CEOUnion Pacific on lookout for new CEOUnion Pacific expanding utility role to be more responsive to train movementsUnion Pacific and SMART-TD hash out sick leave dealUnion Pacific and locomotive engineers ink sick leave dealUP, train engineers reach ‘historic’ deal addressing work-life balanceThe post New labor agreements expected to cost Union Pacific millions appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.Shawn C. BevecThank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.Story continuesJames E. DavisThanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Demand for our services remains strong across all regions boosted by the collaborations we have formed with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid an environment where people are returning to care. We are particularly encouraged by the revenue growth in our base business of nearly 10% from our health system customers. Also in the second quarter, we made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year despite persistently high employee turnover. Total adjusted operating margin improved more than 170 basis points compared to the first quarter despite a decline of approximately $80 million in COVID revenue. This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the second quarter, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023. Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. As we shared at Investor Day, our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers as they navigate the changing landscape in health care. We will enable this growth with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions will continue to be key drivers of our growth. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. So let's review progress we've made in each one of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered strong base volume growth from physicians, largely through our partnerships with health plans, which have expanded our access to the market. A growing number of these involve value-based arrangements and are generating faster growth and share gains than the traditional relationships. These arrangements position us as a more strategic partner with health plans as we work together on leakage, shared savings and redirection programs. In addition, NewYork-Presbyterian's recently acquired outreach assets brought us new volume from the physicians. In Hospital Lab Services, base revenue from health systems grew nearly 10% in the quarter. The Professional Lab Services business had a very strong quarter as we saw solid growth from both new and existing PLS relationships. We are particularly encouraged by progress with our new PLS partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. As hospitals continue to experience financial challenges, we are here to help whether through professional lab services, reference testing or purchasing the hospital's outreach assets. We are now seeing growing momentum with a significant pipeline of potential deals with large health systems. In Consumer Health, we had strong base business growth on questhealth.com. We continue to optimize our marketing efforts to target our customers more strategically and now expect consumer-initiated testing to be profitable through the balance of 2023. Also during the quarter, we launched Genetic Insights, our first consumer-initiated genetics health test on questhealth.com. This saliva-based test leverages our expertise in Next-Generation Sequencing to analyze 3 dozen genes for inherited risk of conditions ranging from breast and colon cancer through carrier status for cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs. We are encouraged by initial demand for this new offering, which adds to our growing test options for health-minded consumers. As discussed at Investor Day in March, a key pillar of our strategy is to support faster growth across all customer segments through highly specialized advanced diagnostics. These offerings include molecular genomics and oncology tests such as germline testing to assess prenatal and hereditary genetic risk and somatic testing for tumor sequencing. Advanced Diagnostics also encompasses other key areas, including neurology, women's reproductive health and cardiometabolic health. In neurology, we continue to achieve strong growth from our innovative Quest AD-Detect, portfolio of Alzheimer's blood tests, which help identify early indications of beta amyloid and ApoE status. AD-Detect strongly positions Quest to lead in this rapidly evolving Alzheimer's landscape. Emerging therapies for Alzheimer's represent a new era in treatment and testing for this disease. Like many diseases, early intervention in Alzheimer's may promote better outcomes. Our AD-Detect portfolio enables accessible and convenient evaluation of Alzheimer's risk potentially at early stages and the monitoring of progression. AD-Detect is now available to our physician customers in the U.S., and we believe it also has the potential to generate strong consumer demand. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services. In June, we completed our acquisition of Haystack Oncology, which positions us to enter the high-growth area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive technique for early detection of residual or recurring cancer with the potential to improve outcomes for patients being treated for cancer. The integration of Haystack is on track, and we continue to expect to introduce our first MRD test in early 2024. We intend to launch this test from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas, where we also recently introduced our solid tumor expanded panel for tumor sequencing and therapy monitoring. I'd like to say a little more about our M&amp;A strategy. Haystack is a capabilities acquisition. And as we've said, it will initially be dilutive for earnings per share. However, our primary focus in M&amp;A continues to be on traditional hospital outreach purchases and tuck-in lab deals that are accretive to earnings in the first year. To underscore what I said earlier, our M&amp;A pipeline is robust as hospital systems faced continued margin pressures due to labor challenges and a shift from inpatient to outpatient care. Turning to operational and productivity improvement, our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our 3% annual productivity savings target. As we discussed at Investor Day, Invigorate includes deploying automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. In the quarter, we implemented our automated microbiology solution in Lenexa, Kansas. Next up is Lewisville, Texas. When complete, 4 of our major laboratories will use automated microbiology lines with embedded artificial intelligence identifying positive and negative cases leading to improved quality and productivity. We are also excited by results of a pilot in our Clifton lab that showed AI speed data collection in specimen processing and expect to implement this AI solution across all of our major regional labs later this year. In genomics, we're utilizing AI in bioinformatics to improve and speed variant classification and prioritization. These are just a couple of the many examples of our use of AI and automation to continuously improve our operations. In addition, we believe generative AI has great potential to deliver insights and content not only to better target and serve customers, but also to create innovations that help standardize our lab operations. We are encouraged by preliminary results of pilots that use generative AI and our customer service center to automate call their sentiment analysis and quality control and in our marketing operations to improve market research and customer targeting. Now before I turn it over to Sam, I'll close by saying that we always knew 2023 would be a challenging year as we transitioned away from COVID-19 testing and supported the nation's return to care. Our dedicated employees on the front lines and everyone else who supports them, have done a magnificent job of bringing our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. I'm really proud to be leading this Quest Diagnostics' team. And now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam?Sam A. SamadThanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.34 billion, down 4.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 9.5% to $2.3 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 88% to $41 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 4.9% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew 0.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 7.4% versus the prior year as we continue to see a broad-based return to care throughout the quarter. Revenue per requisition declined 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.5% due to more tests per req, changes in test mix and benefits recognized with certain value-based arrangements. Unit price reimbursement was flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $348 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $388 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $389 million or 16.7% of revenues compared to $435 million or 17.7% of revenues last year.The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Compared to the first quarter, we made strong progress improving the profitability of the business. Adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points sequentially while total revenues were essentially flat versus Q1. We also absorbed higher SG&amp;A costs related to an increase in the market value of the obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan in the second quarter, which lowered adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. This has no impact on EPS. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. Since last fall, we have taken a series of actions to reduce support costs, which will save more than $100 million this year. Those savings largely began in Q2, and we're on track with our estimates in the quarter. Frontline employee turnover improved marginally earlier this year, but the pace of improvement has not met our expectations, and it remains well above historical levels. We continue to feel the effects of the tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages. Turnover continues to be a drag on productivity despite the strong base business growth. Reported EPS was $2.05 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $538 million versus $882 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income. Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.12 billion and $9.22 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.92 billion and $9.02 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $7.92 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.50 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We've raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect our strong performance through the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Note that the year-over-year comparison for the base business becomes more difficult in the second half of 2023 as we begin to lap some PLS wins later in the year. Also, we are not expecting demand for respiratory panels to be as strong as we saw in last year's flu season, which could be a headwind to revenue of nearly 100 basis points in the back half. We expect revenue and adjusted EPS to be more even in the third and fourth quarters, which is a slight departure from our typical earnings seasonality due to the following factors: Unit price reimbursement is expected to improve in the back half. Our CIT business turned profitable in Q2 and is expected to be more accretive to both revenue and earnings as we move throughout the second half of 2023. And cost actions taken throughout the first half of the year will continue to improve the overall profitability of the business. Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to experience higher frontline turnover and a tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages. Higher SG&amp;A costs related to our supplemental deferred comp plan also lowered the operating margin by 30 basis points in the first half of 2023, but had no impact on EPS. As a result, our updated guidance reflects an adjusted operating margin of approximately 16.5% for the full year. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.James E. DavisThanks, Sam. To summarize, we had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth as our collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians enabled us to benefit from strong demand amid a broad return to care. We made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year. This was slightly offset by persistently high employee turnover, which weighs on productivity and increases cost. And finally, our updated guidance reflects our expectations for revenue growth and improved profitability in the base business. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.Jack MeehanI wanted to start and ask about kind of the health plan commentary. Is it possible to tease out how much of this growth could be share gain related versus just strong underlying demand and somewhat related, we have heard more discussion about national payers being more active around payment integrity. I was just curious if you're seeing that at all, could that be a positive or negative for Quest?James E. DavisYes. Thanks, Jack. So it's always hard to discern in this industry what is share gain versus demand return to care and things like that. We don't get perfect data on it. But our sense is it's some of both. On the share gain side, we look closely at our growth through each of the commercial payers. And when we see gains that are above and beyond the average and we see the benefits of those programs, those value-based programs that we work with them, which is around leakage. It's around focusing on physicians that are using out-of-network labs, we see the benefits of those programs, and therefore, conclude its share gain. Certainly, there's been some strong return to care. On the Payment Integrity side, I can tell you that, look, it's a never-ending effort here in Quest Diagnostics to continuously work denials, to make sure that we understand the payer policies, what are the diagnostic [pros] that support those policies and then work back through our physician base to make sure that the tests that they're ordering are appropriate tests. So we haven't seen any discernible impact with some of those policies you're referring to. But we work collaboratively with the payers to understand them and then work back with our physician base to try to correct any errors.Jack MeehanSuper. Sam, one question on margins. Sorry if I missed this. What is the guide now assume for margins for the year? And can you just talk about what you're assuming in terms of the pace of productivity improvement?Sam A. SamadYes. Thanks, Jack. So we are assuming for the year, operating margins to be at approximately 16.5%. In terms of productivity, you've seen good benefits from our Invigorate program. And we expect those to, if anything, continue for the rest of the year and even accelerate in Q3 and Q4. So we are seeing good momentum on our Invigorate programs. We're seeing the $100 million of SG&amp;A savings that we've talked about. We're seeing those materialize as of the beginning of Q2, and they will continue for the rest of the year as well for a total year impact of $100 million. On the other side, we are also seeing, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a tough labor and turnover and macro environment. So turnover continues to persist to be higher than we expected, and that's driving pressure also on margins. But we are expecting approximately 16.5% for the year in terms of OM.James E. DavisYes. Jack, I would just add, obviously, you can see the base -- you can see the margin improvement from Q1 to Q2. That comes through pretty clear. You can do the math on the base margin improvements from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year, when you make the assumptions on the drop-down of the COVID revenue, which you've -- you're in the range with the numbers you've used in the past. So we're really pleased with the base margin improvement from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year and very pleased with the improvement from Q1 of this year to Q2 of this year.OperatorOur next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonCongrats on a good quarter. My question is, I realized there was a ton of noise this quarter on the deferred comp and how that nets out. How -- could one -- what is your assumption in terms of what's embedded in your guidance for the back half of the year? I appreciate that it can be different based on what happens to the future stock price. But I just want to understand whether it's sort of continuing the forecast of last year's trajectory into this year or 2Q going forward or what have you? And then secondarily, how do you think about you mentioned the labor productivity and sort of the still elevated turnover. So how do you think about sort of the cost benefit of analysis of perhaps like investing more in wages or something like that versus the productivity gains that you would -- you could potentially receive from that?Sam A. SamadOkay. Thanks, Liz, and I appreciate the congrats. So let me talk about DCP deferred compensation, and I'll turn to Jim for productivity and some of the trade-offs that you're referring to there. So in terms of DCP, let me just clarify what it is and the impact. So first of all, the expense that we saw, which impacts SG&amp;A is the -- related to the increase in the market value of obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan. That does not have an impact on EPS because it is offset on the nonoperating income line with a benefit. So it's a net neutral on EPS, but it does impact operating margin. Sometimes we don't see it materially impact us. It's related to market movements. This quarter, it impacted us materially to the tune of 30 basis points impact on operating margin percent. So if you exclude that, it would be our operating margin percent would have been 17%. If you compare it to last year, because last year, and this is where it gets maybe a bit more complicated. But last year, we actually had a benefit in terms of expenses on -- related to deferred compensation, plan market value -- the fair market value change. And so compared to last year Q2, it's an impact of 1%. So actually, if you compare Q2 2023 OM versus Q2 2022 OM, we would have been relatively flat in terms of operating margin percent quarter-over-quarter last year even despite the drop in COVID revenues, a significant drop to the tune of approximately $300 million that we saw year-over-year in terms of COVID revenues. Now as you look towards the rest of the year, Liz, we don't forecast deferred compensation plan. I mean that's not something that we forecast. We assume it's a net neutral impact, both on the P&amp;L, on EPS and on operating margin. So the impact that we saw in the first half, which is roughly about 50 basis points of operating margin or 30 basis points, I should say, is carried through for the rest of the year. And so that 16.5% full year operating margin is impacted by the DCP in the first half. So that's the best way I can characterize it.James E. DavisYes. And Liz, on the labor front, at Investor Day, we showed a chart that said pre-COVID, our turnover of what we call our frontline roles, which is phlebotomy, logistics, specimen processing, our call centers, was in the 14% range, our total turnover. We showed a chart that said in the fourth quarter, it was upwards of 23%. It's come down modestly in the first part of the year, but still hasn't come down to the levels, obviously, pre-COVID or to where we would like them. Now you're right. It's a trade-off between increasing wage rates and the price -- and the cost you pay for this turnover. We've estimated that each turnover, each person can cost us upwards of $8,000 to $10,000 depending on the role. And that's simply the lost productivity or the time it takes to get somebody from day 1 to as efficient in that role as a person who's been in the role for 2-plus years. So it's about $8,000 to $10,000 which if you do the math on that, could have upwards of a $20 million impact in the second half of this year. Now we're at the high end of our wage rate guidance that we gave. We said 3% to 4%. We're certainly at that high end. And if we need to make adjustments, we obviously look at the ROI on that. And we're faced with those decisions. And in certain markets, we will make adjustments to get the turnover to a place that we're comfortable with.OperatorOur next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe just to pivot over and ask you about your Health System Business. I think last quarter, you said in aggregate, it was growing about 70%. And this quarter, the press release says it's just under 10%. And I suspect with NewYork-Presbyterian and so forth coming online fully in the back half, it might be even higher than 10%. When you think about your margin targets and what you're shooting for, can you comment on how the growth in that side of the business is impacting margins and the opportunity? And if there's any updated thoughts on the pipeline that you're seeing, maybe give us that as well.James E. DavisYes. Thanks, A.J. Just on the NewYork-Presbyterian book of business, when we buy that outreach book of business, it actually is in our Physician bucket, not our Health System bucket, because it's physician offices, and we build third-party payers for that. Our Health System business in the quarter was really helped by the PLS side. Our reference book of business was strong as well, but our PLS growth was very, very strong. excited by the 3 deals that we mentioned in the script with Tower Health, Lee Health and Northern Lights being some of the newer ones. So it was -- that generated substantially more growth in the quarter. Now as we've always said, PLS has slightly lower operating margins than our normal physician office book of business. But we really like the ROIC on that, okay? So it's got a strong return on capital and that's why we continue to do this. So in terms of the outlook, our funnel of opportunities is strong. We hope to have more closed in the second half of this year on both the PLS side as well as new reference wins. So we're optimistic that the Health Systems portion of our business will continue to grow.Sam A. SamadYes. And one additional comment, A.J. So with regards to the expectations in the second half on PLS, as Jim said, we are seeing strong growth in that business. In the second half, from a year-over-year perspective, we had some big wins in the first half of last year as well that ramped up in the second half of last year. So from a year-over-year perspective, we do lap some of those PLS wins and that mutes our revenue growth to some extent. But we're seeing really great momentum on the PLS side of the business.OperatorOur next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.Patrick Bernard DonnellySam, again, that 16.5%, is that now the right number to work off in terms of the long-term guide? And you talked about a few of the moving parts, the unit pricing, maybe looking a little better, labor hitting it. Any of these things onetime that would wear off? And then on that pricing, I know you guys negotiate kind of 1/4 of the contracts annually. Can you just talk about the pricing environment at the moment?Sam A. SamadYes. No, it's -- so the 16.5% would be the launching point if you're thinking about the 3-year outlook, Patrick, and the improvement that we guided in the -- in Investor Day, which is the 75 to 150 basis point improvement. That's still the right number to be thinking about longer term off of the 16.5% launching point at the end of this year. In terms of a couple of things that you mentioned, onetime items I think we talked about the DCP, which was more significant in Q2 and for the first half of the year, maybe you can call that onetime. But although it is recurring, but we don't forecast for it. Sometimes it's a benefit. Sometimes it's a negative in terms of an operating margin percent. Last year, in the first half, it was actually a benefit. This year in the first half, it's a negative. Pricing environment is very good. It's really good. We're seeing good momentum with the health plan value-based contract arrangements that we have. And we expect the pricing environment actually in the second half, where the pricing benefit in the second half to improve versus the first half. Now as we think about '24, we've talked about before that PAMA is still an uncertainty. And so until we have more certainty around whether there's another PAMA delay or a SALSA bill that gets passed, there's still some uncertainty there for '24.OperatorThe next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.Brian Gil TanquilutCongrats on the quarter. Sam, maybe I'll follow up just on Patrick's question, right? So as I think about your previous comments on 2024 guidance or targets for operating margin, does this push out what you had previously kind of guided to for 2024? And maybe kind of related to that, as I think about the $100 million of corporate savings that you've outlined that began in Q2. I mean is there more to squeeze or is it sort of the target run rate and we're just going to see it flow through the P&amp;L into next year as well?Sam A. SamadYes. So with regards to -- thank you, Brian, first of all, for the question. So with regards to 24, we didn't guide 24. We gave some long-term targets around what we expect our operating margin to look like over the next 3 years as we continue to execute on productivity improvements, Invigorate and apply cost savings into the business. The $100 million that you referred to, which, by the way, next year will be part of our run rate. So we wouldn't expect to see an improvement year-over-year in '24 versus '23 because we're -- except for maybe 1 quarter. But I would say the 16.5%, as I mentioned to Patrick, becomes the launching point for the future. And we do expect with continued Invigorate offsetting inflation with the cost reductions in the business that we've applied and now will continue and that are generating the expected improvements, we do expect to drive improvement in our operating margins long term. There is the uncertainty about PAMA, which is what drives the range of either 75 to 150 basis points improvement over the 3 years.James E. DavisYes. Then in terms of the cost take out $100 million. Look, we're always looking to be the most efficient we can and obviously, spend every dollar as wisely as we can. But we're also going to continue to invest in this business. We've made strong investments in CIT. And I think as you heard in our script, it's paying off for us. We've got really nice growth out of that. It's now turned profitable. The Alzheimer's test that we've brought to market that requires investment, and we're going to continue to invest in that space. We're going to continue to invest in molecular genomics and oncology because we're getting growth in that space. And with the Haystack acquisition, we're going to continue to invest there to try to get the test to market as quickly as possible and build a stronger presence. So we're always going to balance the 2. But we're investing in this business for the future.OperatorThe next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.Philip ChickeringThere's been a big debate among both the corporates and investors on the sustainability of the current trends of utilization. Can you sort of talk about what you're seeing in July and sorry if I missed this, but how much of the 2Q organic growth was sort of organic versus the PLS transactions? And how should we think about organic growth continuing in the back half of the year?James E. DavisYes. So we're optimistic that the growth will continue here. In the second half of the year, July to date has been strong consistent with what we saw in June. We generally don't break apart our PLS growth from the growth in our core business. We've said externally that our PLS growth is -- our PLS business is about a $600 million franchise. We said the health system market grew at 10%, PLS grew north of that, reference grew less than that. So I think you can get a sense for what that contributes to our total growth. But we're optimistic on the prospects with our health systems. The funnel of PLS opportunities remain strong. Health systems need our help, and we think we've got a great offering that helps meet their needs.Sam A. SamadAnd Pito, maybe I can give a couple of additional comments on sort of second half versus first half, which is I think, where you're driving at here. So listen, we've had a great first half, close to 10% revenue growth. But as you think about the second half, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, we had some easier compare in the first half versus 2022. Obviously, we were in the midst of COVID, base business was impacted by that. So there was some easier compare in the first half that we don't expect to repeat in the second half. On the prepared remarks, we talked about the COVID flu panel, which is about a 1% negative impact on growth in the second half, definitely compared to the first half. We talked about lapping some PLS wins, which also has a muting effect on our growth in the second half. So when you factor all of these combined, obviously, you can look at our implied growth in the second half based on guidance and it's well lower than the first half, and it's driven by some of these factors that I just gave you. In terms of July, we are still seeing higher than our traditional utilization. So we're still encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of utilization in July. So -- but we're being appropriately conservative in the second half in terms of what the utilization would look like.OperatorThe next question is from Andrea Alfonso with UBS.Kevin CaliendoIt's Kevin Caliendo. So I guess, if I can just bridge all this, if we just take -- go back to the starting point with 17% and then the operating margin then went to 16.8% with Haystack, now it's 16.5%, and we had this sort of onetime issue in the quarter with DCP, which took that down. But you're also calling out some labor trend issues. Maybe -- is the delta the expectation around the labor cost and churn? Like is there a way to quantify that? And should we expect that to continue going forward? I'm just trying to bridge all of these things and then think about the impact of '24 how we get the sort of margin expansion that was originally expected for '24 with these sort of headwinds that are playing out?James E. DavisYes, Kevin, let me take the labor piece, and then I'll turn it over to Sam here. So on a previous question, we talked about pre-COVID, our attrition rate of our frontline positions was in the 14% range. In December, Q4 it was 23%. The chart we showed at Investor Day in March, it's slightly better than that. We have quantified it. We've said it's about $8,000 to $10,000 per employee. And in the second half of the year, we think it can be upwards of a $20 million impact versus where we would want it to be at this point in the year. So now, is the labor market is easy? Unemployment rate sits at 3.6% right now. The Fed has signaled that they're trying to actually get the unemployment rate back upwards of up to 4.1%, 4.5%. The interest rates are going to take a notch up again today. So we think there's going to be easing in the markets going forward, but it's hard to predict. And so right now, I think we're being appropriately conservative on the guidance in the second half.Sam A. SamadYes. And so Kevin, let me give you some commentary around second half versus first half margins and why you should have confidence in the margin outlook that we gave, the approximately 16.5% for the year. So first of all, and just to remind everybody, in Q2, our margins expanded by 170 basis points sequentially despite an $80 million drop in COVID, roughly $80 million drop in COVID. So we had some great momentum in terms of operating margin. As we look towards second half versus first half, here are some of the dynamics that you should factor. Our CIT business, which was net dilutive on operating margins in the first half, becomes accretive in the second half. So we expect to see that business -- as we're very encouraged by the momentum and it becomes actually, it's become profitable in Q2, and it's going to be accretive for the second half of the year. Pricing is a net -- also net accretive and will continue to improve in the second half, and it's definitely a step-up from the first half. SG&amp;A, we started to achieve those $100 million annualized savings in Q2. And so we expect to achieve the remainder in Q3 and Q4, we didn't have that benefit in Q1 of this year. We talked about DCP, and I don't want to focus too much on that, but it was a headwind in the first half, which we don't expect in the second half. Offsetting that is the fact that we have some lower COVID revenues in the second half because right now per our guidance, we're expecting approximately $40 million in the second half, which is definitely well south of the $160 million that we achieved in the first. So -- but as you look at this momentum of all of these things, plus the ramp-up of Invigorate improvements that we expect to see in the second half -- and yes, there is some Haystack dilution, which is to the tune of about $0.15 to $0.20 for the year. But as you look at all of these factors, we are very confident about the ability to achieve the outlook that we gave in terms of operating margins.James E. DavisKevin, the last thing I'd add is when you think about price in this business, we tend to always think about commercial payers, Medicare and Medicaid. You have to remember that there's another $2.5 billion on an annual basis where we price directly to Health Systems, to Physicians. And then we have $800 million worth of other businesses between employer solutions, our drug testing business, our wellness business, and our ExamOne business, which serves life insurance companies. So we are getting price in those segments of our business. And as Sam indicated, our price performance will be better in the second half than it was in the first half primarily from the lift we're getting on that side of our portfolio.OperatorAnd our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.Lisa Christine GillI just want to go back to your earlier comments around value-based care where you talked about leakage out-of-network opportunities. But can you maybe just talk about how you see this over time and how you see the evolution of value-based care as it pertains to lab. Is this a margin-enhancing opportunity or just more of a volume opportunity? One, how do I think about that? And then just secondly, I've heard you talk about the pipeline of Health Systems. Is there any way to size what that current pipeline looks like?James E. DavisYes. So on the first question, I just want to make sure we're not confusing terminology here, value-based care and value-based incentives. So when we talk about value-based care, these are generally arrangements where Medicare has put lives directly into these ACO reach programs for Medicare Advantage plans delegate lives into large integrated physician groups. Now in both of those situations, we are contracting directly with these ACO REACH organizations and directly with these large physician groups. And we believe that those value-based care programs that Medicare and Medicare Advantage are driving are very good for the lab business because generally, they delegate lives at a fixed price, and in fact, labs become much more useful in terms of helping physicians ensure that diseases and conditions do not progress. So we feel good about that. I think what we're generally -- when we talk about the health plans and we talk about these things called value-based incentives. So these are programs that we structure with the health plans to help them reduce leakage to out-of-network labs and to help us redirect requisitions that are flowing into more expensive health system laboratories and have those requisitions flow directly into Quest Diagnostics. So when we are successful in those efforts, there can be value-based incentives that we earn when we help them earn the -- when we achieve those targets of reducing leakage and moving work from higher-priced hospital labs into independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So we seek to do more of both of those programs, value-based care programs with ACO REACH and these value-based incentive programs with our large payers.OperatorAnd our last question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.Eric White ColdwellI have 2. First one, a bit higher level, more strategic. So United Healthcare Preferred Lab Network was updated in July. I saw that they removed Mayo, but were there any other notable changes in that contract or your relationship there? And then broadly on that same topic, what's the outlook for other MCO opportunities to narrow networks or move the National Labs like you and LabCorp into, say, more preferred roles? Are there opportunities being discussed in the market today?James E. DavisYes. So on the first part of your question, we did not note any other notable changes with respect to the preferred lab network. We still remain part of that preferred plan network, and that's our plan going forward. In terms of narrowing networks, when we speak to all our commercial payers, we always think it's better, from their perspective, to have both independent labs in network that actually improves their ability to make sure that requisitions are going to lower cost, lower price environments, which is good for the payer. It's good for the employer, and it's good for the patient. And so we don't see any change in that trend to narrow networks that restrict access to independent laboratories. Now having said that, there's laboratories that play on the fringe that could be expensive single-type test environments. And I think the payers are always looking at specialty labs versus independent labs that can do some of that specialty work as well.Eric White ColdwellOkay. My other question, and I apologize if I think you got close to answering this a few times, and I've been toggling a couple of events this morning. But did you quantify or could you quantify the reduction in investment spending seen year-over-year in the second quarter and also the portion of the incremental $100 million plus cost action that you actually captured in 2Q. So we have a sense on what's left for the rest of the year.Sam A. SamadYes. Sure, Eric. So no, we didn't quantify the reduction in investment spend. We did have lower investment spend in Q2 versus Q2 of last year, but we haven't quantified how much it is. With regards to the SG&amp;A benefits and the $100 million, I think the assumption that you can make is it's about 1/3 of that $100 million that was realized in Q2 and we expect the same to occur in Q3 and Q4.James E. DavisYes. I just want to remind, we're going to continue to invest for growth in this business. As we mentioned, again in the script, we've invested in CIT, and we're really starting to see the fruits of that investment. We look at a metric called return on ad spend, it's now positive. So we're going to continue to invest there because we believe it's driving growth, and it's now driving profitable growth. We talked about our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. We're going to continue to invest in that area. These blood-based tests, we have the AB42, 40 test up and running. We have the ApoE up and running. These are blood-based tests. These are going to be more useful than CSF or PET scans and less costly to the environment. We're going to continue to invest in the molecular side of our business. We're going to continue to invest in the oncology business. And that's going to -- all of these things are going to position us for the higher growth segments of the laboratory industry and ensure our long-term outlook.OperatorWe did have one more question come in. Our last question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.Unidentified AnalystThis is John on for Derik. We talked about this quite a bit, but talked about the focus of the M&amp;A pipeline will be on the deals you've traditionally done before. And it seems you certainly have plenty to come in the coming quarters and you have lots of balance. And of course, you're investing in Alzheimer's portfolio and whatnot. But as you look to launch your first MRD product in 2024, could you talk about potential deals or products that you can -- you see would complement your current oncology portfolio that you don't have in your current internal pipeline?James E. DavisWell, we think with the combination of Haystack, which, as you noted, is centered on minimally residual disease testing post cancer diagnosis. And we brought up our own internal assay for therapy selection. So from a therapy monitoring and therapy selection standpoint, we believe we're very well positioned for future growth. We continue to invest on the genetics side of our business, hereditary genetics, genetic offerings for diagnostic purposes and then the family planning and prenatal genetics is also an area that continues to receive focus. So we believe we're well positioned on the cancer side. We continue to make some investments on the genetic side and that's where the -- we think we're well positioned. Now again, our focus right now, we'll continue to focus on hospital outreach deals and other small tuck-ins that are accretive to our business.OperatorThat was our last question.James E. DavisAll right. Well, thank you, everyone. We -- again, I believe we had a strong quarter here. The outlook for the second half. We've taken up our revenue guidance, feel good about that, and thank you for supporting Quest Diagnostics. Have a great day.OperatorThank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call.

600,1edea83c-e11a-3a5c-ba74-492141205b98,GPS,2023-07-27,Gap Inc. just hired the mastermind behind Mattel’s Barbie franchise turnaround as its new CEO. But is the troubled company even fixable?,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-inc-just-hired-mastermind-173443910.html,1690392883,STORY,"['MAT', 'GPS']","[Finally, at extremely long last, the search is over: Gap Inc. has lined up a new CEO.After more than a year without a permanent chief executive, the troubled parent company of Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta said on Wednesday it had hired Richard Dickson as its new chief, effective Aug. 22. He is the operations chief and president at Mattel and instrumental in revitalizing the Barbie franchise, as evidenced by the runaway success of the recent motion picture about the iconic doll. Before joining the toymaker in 2014, Dickson had spent time in the apparel industry in a top job at Jones Group.Thus ends an excruciatingly long CEO search that Gap Inc., all of whose brands saw net sales decline last quarter, can’t afford to mess up. The Gap and Banana Republic brands are shadows of their former selves: The Gap brand’s 2022 net global sales were $3.7 billion, or 40% less than a decade earlier—while Old Navy and Athleta, for years juggernauts sustaining the company, have fallen into decline. So when it came to the search for a new chief, interim CEO Bobby Martin repeatedly said that the board would “take the time to get this right.”However well-regarded and well-rounded Dickson is, though, he has a big job ahead of him. His two immediate predecessors, Sonia Syngal, former head of Old Navy who left last July after only two years, and Art Peck, were both ousted for failing to fix Gap Inc.’s seemingly intractable problems, including failing to adapt quickly to changes in fashion and a bureaucratic culture. Fixing this company won’t be easy.Syngal, whose star rose as she led Old Navy to heights before she took the Gap Inc. reins at the start of the pandemic, stumbled over the parent company’s plan to offer more inclusive sizing at Old Navy; that led to a glut of unsold inventory that had to be marked down. And her efforts to make Gap more relevant through a big collaboration with Yeezy proved ill-fated, leading to tens of millions of dollars in losses. Before her, Peck failed to restore Gap Inc. to its place as a fashion retailer leading trends.Story continuesConsumers as a whole are also pulling back on discretionary spending as they’re faced with oodles of choices: Why shop at Old Navy when you can get similar offerings at Target? Why shop at Athleta when athleisure is everywhere?But Dickson’s résumé suggests he has as good a chance as anyone to succeed. Analysts note Dickson’s work on the Barbie turnaround in particular points to skills that will be helpful in revitalizing Gap Inc.’s often tired brands. He understood that to modernize the iconic doll, Mattel had to make it more inclusive with moves such as releasing Barbie dolls with additional skin tones and body types. Under Dickson, Mattel also changed up its marketing by advertising directly to parents.“His reinvention of the Barbie franchise, which is currently riding on a high, is also proof that he understands how to turn around established brands that have run out of energy and steam. This is exactly the challenge he will need to address at Gap,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, an analytics and consulting company, in a research note.Contrast that with excuses about “product acceptance issues” trotted out at various times by Martin and Peck on calls with Wall Street analysts over the years to explain declining sales—language that seemed to blame consumers rather than the company, and reflected a problematic way of seeing things that made a potential turnaround harder to execute.What’s more, Dickson has experience in apparel that will serve him well. “Gap’s turnaround prospects just got better with the naming of Richard Dickson as its new chief executive officer. Dickson, who already sits on Gap’s board, has apparel experience from stints at Bloomingdale’s and Nine West,” Mary Ross Gilbert, senior retail analyst, wrote in a Bloomberg Intelligence research note.And Dickson at least has something to work with. Athleta, whose struggles began only recently, poached its new CEO from hot yoga brand Alo. Banana Republic seemed to find its swagger back in 2022 after years of decline, and has improved its assortment and store decor. And Old Navy is a massive $9 billion brand with a big reservoir of goodwill from consumers to tap into. (Alas, the Gap brand seems not to have many green shoots at the moment.)So kudos to Gap Inc. for hiring someone like Dickson. If anyone can do it, Dickson might well be that person.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

But we can't have any kind of future if we don't have a healthy planet. That's why we're focusing on not just a sustainable future, but a regenerative one. Regeneration means moving beyond a ""doing no harm"" mindset to one in which we build the capacity of our social and environmental systems to heal and thrive.Earth just had its hottest June on record. If we don't limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5° Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, we will face dramatic consequences, as natural disasters such as floods, more severe and frequent weather events, longer and more severe droughts, and food shortages can be exacerbated by a changing climate.How do we limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C? In short, the world must reach zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. If that sounds hard, it's because it will be. But the science says we can get there if we act now and act with urgency.We must build a sustainable future: one in which we can phase out our reliance on fossil fuels, address a century's worth of pollution, provide economic opportunity to communities around the world, and align our activities with the physical boundaries of our Earth.Story continuesWe believe that future is possible, and Cisco can help get us there. We have a plan:It is possible to power the world with affordable clean energy, so we are helping to digitize smart grids and smart buildings.It is possible to design out waste, so we are re-building products from used ones.It is possible to strengthen nature with technology, so we are using the Internet of Things (IoT) to protect the world's biodiversity.This is The Plan for Possible, Cisco's next generation environmental sustainability strategy.The progress we make in this decade will be critical for future generations. We're aligning our environmental strategy to rise to this challenge.Priority 1: Transition to clean energyTo power the world with renewables, the grid requires updated digital infrastructure to connect diverse, decentralized sources of clean energy. But even as the world electrifies, we must simultaneously reduce the amount of energy used by a connected economy. As a part of this priority, we've also set a goal to reach Net Zero across our value chain by 2040, which includes both our supplier and our customer use of energy.How we'll do it:Lead in energy efficiency innovationConnect clean energy and digitize the gridCollaborate with our customers, partners, and suppliers to accelerate the energy transitionExamples of where we've already made an impact:Developing the Silicon One chip to reduce energy consumption while increasing bandwidthPioneering Universal Power Over Ethernet (PoE) to optimize energy use for smart buildingsHelping our supply chain set GHG reduction targets*Partnering to digitize Enel Group's grid through smarter networksPriority 2: Evolve the business to circularNow is the time to transition from an economy that extracts resources and eventually wastes them, to a circular one which finds new uses for products and their inputs. We aim to transform our business to extend the useful life of our products and provide ongoing services.How we'll do it:Adopt and scale business models to extend the value of our products and reduce environmental impactsInvest in technology incubation to be at pace with environmental scienceChampion a digital, nature-positive value chain leveraging our role as one of the largest telecom device companies in the worldExamples of where we've already made an impact:Incorporating circular design principles into 100 percent of new products and packaging by 2025Offering the Cisco Takeback and Reuse Program, which lets customers return hardware that has reached end-of-use, at no cost.Creating the Green Pay circular IT payment solution, increasing value for our customers and our resale businessRemanufacturing devices through Cisco Refresh to give them a new life for our business and planetPriority 3: Invest in resilient ecosystemsThriving economies depend on stable environments and inclusive societies. Our value chains benefit from resilient ecosystems, both financial and ecological. It is in our shared interest to help humans and nature navigate a changing climate by investing in regenerative technologies, workforces, and nature itself.How we'll do it:Enable communities to adapt to climate realitiesCultivate skills and talent for the regenerative economyDeploy Cisco technology to protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversityHarness artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and blockchain to advance regenerative models, powered by energy-efficient infrastructureExamples of where we've already made an impact:Powering Vibrant Planet's Data Commons platform to better manage local land use and plan for risks like wildfires**Enhancing London's Canary Wharf with a connected landscape to optimize the space for engaging with natureProviding analysis capabilities for Vesta to optimize placement of its low-energy carbon sequestration**Supporting Kara Solar in training Indigenous peoples in the Amazon to build and operate solar-powered boats**Powering possible with enhanced governanceWe are embedding sustainability into the way we operate. We intend to stay aligned with the pace of science while ensuring support from the entire organization. The holistic pursuit of equity and sustainability is the only path forward that allows us to maintain the public's trust in our values.By pursuing what's possible, we can accelerate the transition into the digital age while maintaining the health of the planet - and a climate future we all need and desire for future generations to come.Visit our ESG Reporting Hub for more details on our environmental initiatives.* We have a goal that 80% of Cisco component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend have a public, absolute GHG emissions reduction target by FY25.
