In both cases, outside of absolute contagion/panic resulting in a run on their deposits (a very low probability tail risk), we view the impact on the businesses as more of an “earnings” event, not a “balance sheet” event. Zions and Schwab got caught up in the contagious fear around SVB’s collapse due to some optical similarities between their balance sheets (namely bonds carried at mark-to-market losses), and Zions being a West Coast regional bank. We believe the similarities largely end there. Zions has a much more diverse deposit base than SVB. We estimate that half of Zions’ deposit base are small and medium-sized business operating deposits, which have historically been quite stable and a competitive advantage. Nearly half of Zions’ deposits are FDIC-insured, and the bank has ample liquidity to meet outflows without selling its securities portfolio. Similarly, Schwab’s retail deposit base is very sticky. Over 80% of their customers’ cash is FDIC-insured, and the cash is spread across approximately 34 million brokerage accounts (average ~$10,000 in bank cash per account). Schwab has more balance sheet liquidity than deposits. In both cases, there appears to be a low risk of correlation among their respective client bases. Although there will likely be some profit headwinds that stem from this crisis, we viewed the large declines in these shares as overly punitive, and thus believe the risk/reward for each is increasingly attractive.

This has compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing.Although dividend stocks do not offer dramatic price appreciation, they are a major source of consistent income for investors in any type of market. These stocks tend to outperform during volatile markets and can reduce the volatility of a portfolio (read: Fearing a US Recession? 5 ETF Areas to Tap).The dividend-focused products offer safety through payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile amid large swings in stock prices. This is because the companies that payout dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis.Additionally, dividend-paying stocks attract income-focused investors in a rising rate environment, which is quite negative for bonds. The central bank has been on an aggressive tightening policy since the 1980s to fight skyrocketing inflation. Fed funds futures traders are currently pricing in a 70% probability that the Fed will hike rates by an additional 25 basis points at its May 2-3 meeting.Here, we have highlighted the 10 most-popular dividend ETFs for investors seeking steady income irrespective of stock market directions.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is the largest and the most-popular ETF in the dividend space, with AUM of $65.4 billion and an average daily volume of 1.1 million shares.

6,f4351bcd-560c-3473-99ff-0cc999bd8360,SCHW,2023-04-12,Higher Interest Rates to Support Schwab's (SCHW) Q1 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/higher-interest-rates-support-schwabs-142102411.html,1681222862,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Charles Schwab SCHW is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 17, before market open. Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have improved on a year-over-year basis.In fourth-quarter 2022, Schwab’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds. However, higher expenses created a headwind.The company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and lagged in two of the trailing four quarters.Schwab’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s first-quarter earnings has been revised 9.9% lower to 91 cents. However, the estimate indicates an increase of 18.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for first-quarter earnings is 90 cents.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $5.18 billion, which suggests an increase of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is $5.30 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 13.4%.SCHW projects year-over-year revenue growth of 10%.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab’s first-quarter performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q1Similar to 2022, market volatility and client activity have been robust in the first quarter. Several factors, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, continued supply-chain disruptions, bank runs, fears of an economic downturn/recession and the central banks’ hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation, led to ambiguity among investors.These factors resulted in heightened volatility in the equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.Investors seemed interested in entering the markets. In January, SCHW opened 344,000 new brokerage accounts. In February, brokerage accounts opened were 320,000.Thus, while Schwab’s trading performance is expected to have been robust in the quarter under review, supported by higher volatility and client activity, trading revenues are not expected to have improved from the year-ago quarter (which created a record).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter trading revenues is pegged at $908 million, which suggests a decline of 5.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is $890 million.The consensus estimate for asset management and administration fees of $1.08 billion suggests a rise of 1.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $975.5 million.Then, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $504 billion, which suggests a decline of 20.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level. Our estimate for average interest-earning assets is $484.3 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 23.4%.Despite not-so-impressive loan growth in the first quarter, Schwab’s net interest revenues are expected to have improved, supported by higher interest rates (though the pace has slowed down, the Federal Reserve continued with the tightening of monetary policy, raising rates by another 50 basis points in the quarter). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest revenues is pegged at $2.9 billion, which suggests a year-over-year rise of 32.8%. Our estimate for the same is $3 billion.Coming to expenses, Schwab’s operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to the persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter. We project total expenses to rise 12.3% year over year to $3.2 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low.

7,5681fc65-1512-360d-8117-9509c0fe5fc6,SCHW,2023-04-12,Goldman Sachs (GS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-gs-expected-beat-140002901.html,1681221602,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', 'SCHW']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Goldman Sachs (GS) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.7%.Revenues are expected to be $13.21 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.04% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goldman?For Goldman, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.62%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Goldman will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goldman would post earnings of $5.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.32, delivering a surprise of -36.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Goldman appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +18.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.18 billion, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The Charles Schwab Corporation has been revised 13.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.11%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Charles Schwab Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

8,b7b63135-0d64-308f-8df9-faf34f166ea5,SCHW,2023-04-12,Brokers Suggest Investing in The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-charles-schwab-133001997.html,1681219801,STORY,['SCHW'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW).The Charles Schwab Corporation currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.73 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SCHWBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SCHWCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for The Charles Schwab Corporation here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying The Charles Schwab Corporation, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in SCHW?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 11.8% over the past month to $3.81.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for The Charles Schwab Corporation. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for The Charles Schwab Corporation with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), TotalEnergies SE (TTE) and Raytheon Technologies Corp. (RTX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Texas Instruments have gained +6.7% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +12.8%. The company is benefiting from growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets. Moreover, a solid rebound in the automotive market remains a positive.Further, the strengthening demand in industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a tailwind. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.However, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds. Further, weakness in the Analog segment of the company is a concern. Additonally, softness in the personal electronics end-market remains an overhang.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +17.4%). The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets acts as a tailwind.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TTE has enough liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations. TTE is making investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, TTE’s production is impacted by the security-related production cuts in some regions. TTE remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. A natural decline in production and TTE’s withdrawal from Russia might affect profitability.(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Raytheon Technologies’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry over the past six months (+21.4% vs. +18.1%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its combat-proven defense products and expects both domestic and international program growth to remain robust for its defense business.This should boost the revenue generation prospects for its defense business. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic continues to boost commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for it. The stock holds a solid solvency position.Yet, economic sanctions imposed by governments in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might hurt Raytheon. A comparative analysis of its trailing 12-month Price/Book ratio indicates a relatively gloomy picture, which may concern investors’. The appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock.(You can read the full research report on Raytheon Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Morgan Stanley (MS), Sony Group Corp.

Its efforts to reward shareholders via dividends and share buybacks are impressive.Solid Product Suite Aid Ecolab (ECL) Amid Stiff CompetitionThe Zacks analyst is upbeat about Ecolab's robust product portfolio, delivering comprehensive solutions and personalized service, despite its operation in a highly competitive market.Empaveli, Syfovre Fuel Growth For Apellis (APLS) Per the Zacks analyst, the encouraging uptake of Empaveli and approval of additional drugs should fuel growth for Apellis. However, Apellis faces stiff competition for its products.Crestwood Partners (CEQP) to Gain On Crude Gathering VolumesThe Zacks analyst believes that Crestwood Partners' 320,000-barrels-of-crude-oil-per-day of gathering pipelines will help generate incremental cash flows.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session.

This is likely to improve surplus supply issues and boost memory chip prices which bodes well for chipmakers like Western Digital.This maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -193.9%.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this steel company have returned -5.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $3.76 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -51%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.37 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -46.6%. This estimate has changed +8.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.97 indicates a change of -15.6% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -22.2%. The $33.69 billion and $29.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.8% and -12.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.8%. EPS of $4.89 for the same period compares with $7.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.29%. The EPS surprise was +16.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nucor (NUE) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.81 a share, just 10 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 20, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $3.81 Most Accurate Estimate and the $3.76 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nucor has an Earnings ESP of 1.42%.NUE is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM).Slated to report earnings on April 27, 2023, Agnico Eagle Mines holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.47 a share 17 days from its next quarterly update.Agnico Eagle Mines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 18.47% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.39.NUE and AEM's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The advantageous locations of its properties have been driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.Alexandria has also been experiencing healthy leasing activity on solid demand for its high-quality office/laboratory space. This has been aiding the company’s rental rate growth. In 2022, it registered rental rate growth of 31% and 22.1% (cash basis).Also, a tenant base of more than 1,000 high-quality companies ensures steady rental revenues for ARE.In order to enhance its operating platform, Alexandria has been focusing on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations. In 2022, it completed acquisitions in its key life-science cluster submarkets totaling 10.2 million square feet (SF) for $2.8 billion.  Moreover, ARE’s encouraging development pipeline bodes well for its long-term growth. As of Dec 31, 2022, it had 5.6 million rentable square feet (RSF) properties under construction and seven near-term projects aggregating 2 million RSF. This pipeline is expected to generate $655 million of incremental annual rental revenues from first-quarter 2023 through fourth-quarter 2025.On the balance sheet front, ARE had $5.3 billion of liquidity as of the end of 2022. It has no debt maturities prior to 2025. Also, investment-grade credit ratings of Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Positive from Moody’s and S&amp;P Global Ratings, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. With a strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and ARE has remained committed to that. In December 2022, it announced a 2.5% sequential hike in its third-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.21 per share. Moreover, Alexandria increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.84%.Given the company’s strong operating platform, our adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) growth projections of 12.4% for 2023, a decent financial position and a lower payout ratio compared with the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Nonetheless, Alexandria’s huge development and redevelopment pipeline, although encouraging for growth, exposes it to the risks associated with rising construction costs and lease-up concerns.Higher interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 6.8% in the past six months against its industry’s growth of 8.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Terreno Realty TRNO and Innovative Industrial Properties IIPR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

19,253fe60c-64e7-3b92-aa68-e6a7d8bffa2d,UNM,2023-04-12,Buy These 5 Low Price-to-Book Value Stocks in April,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-low-price-book-115611461.html,1681214171,STORY,"['GM', 'UNM', 'DBK.DE', 'PVH', 'ENS']","[Value investors prefer price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. However, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for the purpose. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareThe P/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank DB, General Motors GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH and EnerSys ENS are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000:A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

20,713bd272-cfcf-39ae-9ed3-4677f4f31db2,UNM,2023-04-12,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154503208.html,1681141503,STORY,['UNM'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusUnum (UNM) is headquartered in Chattanooga, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -5.34% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.33 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.4%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.6%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.76%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.80%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Unum's payout ratio is 21%, which means it paid out 21% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for UNM for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.68 per share, with earnings expected to increase 7.57% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

21,c73ba072-a813-37af-a781-1cf101625732,STT,2023-04-12,Bank of America (BAC) Reports Next Week: What to Know Ahead of the Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-america-bac-reports-next-140002276.html,1681221602,STORY,"['BAC', 'STT']","[Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when Bank of America (BAC) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis nation's second-largest bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $25.24 billion, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bank of America?For Bank of America, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bank of America will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Bank of America would post earnings of $0.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of +11.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Bank of America doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsState Street Corporation (STT), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.65 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.11 billion, up 1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for State Street Corporation has been revised 0.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.97%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street Corporation?For State Street Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that State Street Corporation would post earnings of $2 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.07, delivering a surprise of +3.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.State Street Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Citigroup (C) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.67 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -17.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $19.92 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Citigroup has been revised 0.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.12%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Citigroup will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for the purpose. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareThe P/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank DB, General Motors GM, Unum Group UNM, PVH Corp. PVH and EnerSys ENS are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000:A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

But that is at the forefront of Marcus Brown's job description.""A Federal Reserve study showed that, on average, Black people have less than 15 percent as much wealth as White people,"" Brown said. ""We're not able to fix systemic racism as a bank, but we can play a role in addressing that wealth disparity.""As part of that effort, Brown took on a role in 2020 as strategy manager focused on the Black segment within the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion team at the bank.He brought a lot of expertise with him, having joined the bank nearly seven years ago in the bank's U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corp., which invests billions of dollars annually in communities, including projects to provide affordable housing to people with low incomes.Brown served as a training and development program manager, leading workshops for U.S. Bank employees to help them understand the racial wealth gap and how they can help address it.""After George Floyd's murder in 2020, there was a real desire among the bank's senior leaders to double down on our commitment to address inequities among the Black population,"" Brown said.The racial wealth gap can be narrowed by providing Black Americans with greater access to capital, including personal and business loans, as well as access to financial education and investment services, Brown said.In early 2021, U.S. Bank launched Access Commitment™, a long-term approach focused on advancing diverse leaders, increasing business with diverse suppliers, growing ownership and assets for people and small businesses, and investing in Black communities.Story continues""We have been able to more than double the amount of money the bank spends with diverse suppliers and we've implemented a series of initiatives tied to our different business lines,"" Brown said.""We're not able to fix systemic racism as a bank, but we can play a role in addressing that wealth disparity.""-Marcus BrownFor example, the bank's mortgage lending group launched Access Home, which is designed to increase Black homeownership by recruiting and training more Black mortgage loan officers, partnering with nonprofit organizations and providing financial education outreach programs.""It has helped provide employees a pathway to go from, say, a job in a call center to a career as a mortgage loan officer,"" Brown said. ""By creating greater Black representation in the business line, we create more market share for Black consumers.""The different efforts have helped drive a shift in how the bank's different business lines work together, he said.""I'm so proud of how we've broken down silos,"" Brown said. ""We've been able to look across the business lines and get an understanding of what they're working on and finding opportunities to drive synergies, especially around financial education.""The bank also launched a leadership academy to help more Black employees position themselves for leadership roles. The academy has been expanded to also serve employees with Asian and Latinx backgrounds.""These three groups are historically marginalized in America and it's beneficial for us to have programs that build cohorts who can learn from each other and other people at the bank, as well as at other companies,"" Brown said.Access Commitment community programs help increase financial education, including the role banks can play in helping people build credit and ultimately wealth, he said.""We have to deal with the historical distrust of banks among people in marginalized communities,"" Brown said.The different initiatives that are part of Access Home are all measured for effectiveness and being enhanced as needed, he said.""It's one thing to just do programs but we've partnered with the Urban Institute to measure our impact and hold us accountable,"" Brown said.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Cintas (CTAS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CTAS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Cintas' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Cintas' main business drivers.Founded in 1968 and headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, Cintas Corporation provides specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. It also operates in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company designs, manufactures, implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products and first aid and safety products for diversified businesses.Notably, the company provides products and services through distribution and retail channels to small service and manufacturing companies as well as leading corporations.The company primarily reports revenues under two operating segments — Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services.Uniform Rental and Facility Services (78.4% of third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues) segment includes rental, and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels as well as the provision for restroom supplies, and other facility products and services. Further, selling items from catalogs to customer routes are reported under this segment.First Aid and Safety Services (10.6% of third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues) segment includes the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training to customers.Businesses, with Uniform Direct Sale and Fire Protection Services, are included in All Other. Revenues generated from All Other businesses represented 11.1% of second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues.It's worth mentioning here that results of First Aid and Safety Services segment and All Other businesses are grouped under Other Services in Cintas' income statement.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Cintas, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $10,299.36, or a 929.94% gain, as of April 10, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 164.28% and the price of gold went up 23.71% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for CTAS.Strong segmental performances are aiding Cintas. Increased volumes are boosting the Uniform Rental and Facility Services unit’s results. Strength in the first aid cabinet service business is driving growth of the First Aid and Safety Services unit. Cintas’ efforts to reward shareholders are impressive. Last July, CTAS hiked its dividend by 21%. The company’s improved earnings and revenue forecast for fiscal 2023 is encouraging. Amid these positives, shares of the company have outperformed its industry in the past six months. However, rising cost of sales (up 11.3% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023) poses a threat to the bottom line. Selling and administrative expenses also climbed 16.6% in the same period. Foreign currency headwinds might hurt sales going forward. The company's weak liquidity position is an added woe.The stock has jumped 5.47% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 8 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Hologic is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that HOLX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.13, while EW has a forward P/E of 33.30. We also note that HOLX has a PEG ratio of 1.46. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 4.88.Another notable valuation metric for HOLX is its P/B ratio of 4.01. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 8.93.Based on these metrics and many more, HOLX holds a Value grade of B, while EW has a Value grade of C.Story continuesHOLX has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than EW, so it seems like value investors will conclude that HOLX is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 6.84%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 6.51%.Walmart will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.31, up 0.77% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $148.34 billion, up 4.78% from the year-ago period.WMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.10 per share and revenue of $630.47 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -3.02% and +3.14%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Walmart. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.24.Also, we should mention that WMT has a PEG ratio of 4.49.

The results show that almost half of all employees (47%) report feeling stressed in everyday life. When asked what factors put them at risk for burnout at work, the top three were work pressures (54%), poor leadership (39%), and toxic culture (37%).Addressing employee stress and burnout starts with addressing psychological safety in the workplace. Only 58% of employees agreed or strongly agreed that they feel free to speak their mind without fear of negative consequences. Leading employers are tackling the underlying causes of workplace stress as part of a comprehensive and inclusive benefits strategy, such as reviewing job design and supervisor competencies, creating a culture of belonging and inclusive decision making, and offering benefits such as reduced cost mental health treatment and virtual counseling. Encouragingly, nearly 70% of employees globally believe their organization would support them in an emergency or time of need.Beyond work stressors, 21% of employees are concerned about affording healthcare, with women (26%), and single mothers in particular (32%), significantly more likely to lack confidence that they can afford needed healthcare than men (18%). Employers are in a unique and critical position to address healthcare gaps by exploring benefits and employee experience strategies that balance human and digital health delivery and respond to the different needs of a diverse workforce.Story continuesAdditionally, the findings show that employees who believe their employer cares about their health and well-being are much more likely to be thriving – feeling positive about their health, wealth, and careers. The findings also show that there is a positive correlation between higher levels of benefits and employee satisfaction. In fact, employees who receive 10 or more benefits are more likely to believe their employer cares about their health and well-being, are less likely to move to a different employer, and are more confident that they can afford the healthcare their family needs.Hervé Balzano, President, Health, Mercer &amp; Global Leader, Mercer Marsh Benefits highlighted the importance of offering a wide range of benefits: ""In recent years, employees’ health and well-being have been put under pressure by multiple crises – ranging from economic and geopolitical conflicts to the global pandemic. Our research shows how these challenges, along with multiple pressure points facing healthcare systems, have brought to light significant gaps in protection for workforces. This is particularly true among groups such as low-paid workers, caregivers, and women,"" said Mr. Balzano.""The findings from Health on Demand clearly show that by providing comprehensive benefits, employers can address these risks, protect their employees and ultimately create a foundation for them to thrive at work and beyond,"" he added.Amy Laverock, Global Advice and Solutions Leader at Mercer Marsh Benefits, underscored the need for employers to take a values-based approach to their benefits strategies.""Employees who feel cared for by their employer are more likely to report organizational leadership that is committed to a healthy culture. Work-related commitments such as embedding well-being in job design and taking action on issues such as living wages and social justice are a key part of this,"" said Ms. Laverock. ""It also means giving employees confidence that they can afford the healthcare that they and their families need and having access to benefits that are relevant to them.""About the 2023 Health on Demand ReportThe 2023 Health on Demand Report was fielded in October-November 2022, and surveyed 17,531 employee respondents in 16 global markets about their priorities when it comes to health and well-being. The resulting report captures the voice of the employee to inform discussion around employee health and well-being needs, including the relationship between providing benefits and enabling employees to thrive, benefits that are suitable for the environment in which employees live, and benefits aligned with company purpose to support the wider health of society.About Mercer Marsh BenefitsMercer Marsh Benefits provides clients with one source for managing the costs, people risks, and complexities of employee benefits.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. MGM Resorts (MGM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.06 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 1, 2023.MGM Resorts' Earnings ESP sits at 4300%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.06 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.MGM is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Wynn Resorts (WYNN) as well.Wynn Resorts, which is readying to report earnings on May 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.

From “Sin City” to online gambling stocks, there are plenty of options for growth investors looking to get in on the action, by betting on the house.One of the most prominent trends underpinning the recent gambling boom is the surge in sports betting mania. As of March 2023, 33 states have legalized sports betting. Additionally, around 68 million Americans, or 20% of the U.S. population, said they would wager on March Madness. That’s up from 50 million in February for the Superbowl.The online gambling industry alone is expected to grow at a 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030. I believe even higher growth is possible, considering the number of Millennials and Gen Z individuals feeding this gambling trend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, these three gambling stocks are well-positioned to make the most out of these strong secular tailwinds.DKNGDraftKings$18.16MGMMGM Resorts International$42.98PENNPENN Entertainment$28.93DraftKings (DKNG)DraftKings (DKNG) logo on a phoneSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.comDraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) stock has been hot this year, delivering nearly 70% growth year-to-date, as sports betting trends accelerate. Despite these tailwinds, and the stock’s recent surge, DKNG stock still changes hands 74% below its peak.DraftKings trades for around $18 per share right now. That said, I think with significant upside potential remains with this name. That’s because the company has been expanding its offerings beyond sports betting, to include online casino games and other forms of online gambling. This diversification could help DraftKings capture more significant market share in the online gambling space.According to Yahoo Finance, analysts are bullish on DKNG stock, with an average rating of buy and a 12-month stock price forecast of $24.14. This implies upside potential of roughly 35% from current levels. The company’s financials also appear to be strong, with revenue growing 80% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in 2022.Story continuesDraftKings is not yet profitable, but its net losses have narrowed quarter-over-quarter. These numbers should continue to improve in the fourth quarter of this year. Accordingly, the company’s strong growth profile is what I think deserves more attention, making DraftKings an unprofitable gambling stock worth buying now.MGM Resorts International (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is another top gabling stock which has been propelled by the impressive gambling craze in this post-Covid world. With key operations in both Las Vegas and China, MGM is known for its luxury resorts and casino operations in the world’s biggest gambling centers. Macau and Las Vegas are two of the world’s top gambling capitals, both of which were hit hard by pandemic-related closures. However, MGM will be a standout winner among gambling stocks as both cities roar back.MGM stock has gained 31.5% year-to-date, with quickly-improving financials. Its Q4 earnings beat analyst expectations, with revenue of $3.59 billion representing year-over-year growth of 17.4%. Additionally, the company’s income came in at $284 million, meaning MGM stock trades at a bargain price-earnings ratio of only 12.9-times. Of course, more factors determine the stock’s valuation. MGM has substantial debt, and is expected to see reduced profits in the coming quarters. However, all things considered, the stock still deserves a much higher valuation.Analysts have an average price target of $55.7 for the stock, implying 27.3% upside.PENN Entertainment (PENN)Penn (PENN) National Gaming logo on the website homepage.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comPENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) is an outlier in this list of top gambling stocks to buy. This year, PENN stock has been trading sideways, down 1% on a year-to-date basis. That’s much worse than the broader market. However, I believe there’s nothing wrong about the company or its fundamentals, or at least not enough to cause it to trade at these levels. Instead, the risk of a recession drives investors away from the company.Of course, the risk of a recession is much lower than a few months before. As markets remain robust, and the Federal Reserve is set to pause its incredibly-fast rate hiking program, companies like PENN Entertainment should benefit. Other factors, such as a robust labor market, also point to the idea that the U.S. economy is more resilient than ever. Thus, as more investors buy into the growthier areas of the market, PENN stock could be poised to deliver much-improved results in the quarters ahead.PENN stock’s average analyst price target is $41.2, implying 42.1% upside. A number of analysts believe this stock could go as high as $55 over the next 12 months.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:NCLH) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/62-institutional-ownership-norwegian-cruise-153116457.html,1681140676,STORY,['NCLH'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. Check out our latest analysis for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 5.6% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Norwegian Cruise Line HoldingsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around US$37m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.29%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.92%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 0.9% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 10.29% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.51% in that time.Microchip Technology will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Microchip Technology to post earnings of $1.62 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 20%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $2.22 billion, up 20.42% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Microchip Technology. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Microchip Technology is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Looking at its valuation, Microchip Technology is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 13.07. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.01.It is also worth noting that MCHP currently has a PEG ratio of 0.77. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: STMicroelectronics STM, Microchip Technology MCHP, Analog Devices ADI and Lam Research Corp. LRCX.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Amid Market VolatilityGlobal semiconductor sales have been slowing down over the past few months. According to the latest report from Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)  global semiconductor industry sales were $39.7 billion in February, with a sequential decrease of 4% and a whopping 20.7% drop from the prior-year figure of $50 billion. This marked the sixth consecutive sequential decline.SIA president and CEO, John Neuffer cited short-term market cyclicality and macroeconomic headwinds being the reasons behind the slash. A number of interrelated issues, like rising prices, geopolitical tensions and pandemic aftereffects, have combined to cause the current short-term decline. These elements have influenced consumer spending, and resulted in macroeconomic uncertainty and swings in semiconductor demand. Also, currency fluctuations and the fears of global recession are negatively impacting the semiconductor industry.Nonetheless, Neuffer stated that ""the market's medium- and long-term prospects remain bright, thanks to growing demand across a range of end markets.""Semiconductors are the backbone of the current-day technology-driven economy. Digitization across industries, the adoption of cloud computing, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning are likely to fuel demand for semiconductors.The accelerated deployment of 5G technology — the next-generation wireless revolution — is likely to propel further growth.

Of the three major stock indexes, — the Dow — the best performer of 2022 — was up a mere 0.4% in first-quarter 2023. The broad-market index — the S&amp;P 500 — was up 7%.  Surprisingly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied 16.8% last quarter.Within the technology sector, the rally was predominantly driven by the semiconductor industry. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) is up 21.3% year to date. The use of chipsets is increasing rapidly in various industries of the economy. This will act as the primary catalyst for long-term growth.Strong Demand for ChipsetsFrom consumer electronics to automakers, high-tech computers, medical devices and fighter jet missile systems, are using chipsets. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act of 2022 into a law. This legislation will provide $52 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.The Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 37% share of the global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12%.Consequently, U.S. businesses, especially the auto and high-tech industries are suffering from an acute shortage of chipsets owing to the breakdown of the global supply chain during the pandemic. The chipset manufacturers are thriving buoyed by the massive growth of electrical vehicles.The explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) in both the production process and the final products has created tremendous opportunities for chipset manufacturers. The data-centric computing architecture, especially, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the metaverse, has expanded the horizon for semiconductors.The pandemic-led social transformation has established digitization as the new normal. The outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and lookout of people. The latest advent of the digitization space is the metaverse. In a nutshell, metaverse means a virtual world that is interactive and collaborative. The digital space is powered using virtual and augmented reality. Therefore, high-tech semiconductors are an essential part of metaverse.Story continuesSeveral giant chipset manufacturers in the United States, Asia and Europe are ramping up capital spending creating new facilities for chipset production to cater to massive pent-up demand. The demand for chipsets will remain strong due to the complexity of new leading-edge technologies.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five semiconductor manufacturers. These stocks have positive growth potential for 2023 and have witnessed solid earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

60,98b11070-d03f-35ec-adfa-4d3656cf7512,MET,2023-04-12,How Much Upside is Left in MetLife (MET)? Wall Street Analysts Think 34.95%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-metlife-met-135501338.html,1681221301,STORY,"['TGT', 'MET']","[MetLife (MET) closed the last trading session at $59.48, gaining 0.9% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $80.27 indicates a 35% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises 11 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $5.37. While the lowest estimate of $74 indicates a 24.4% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 51.3% to reach $90. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in MET. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for METHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in METAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, three estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.5%.Moreover, MET currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much MET could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -18.38% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.5 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.39%. In comparison, the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield is 2.28%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.76%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2 is up 1% from last year. MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4.28%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. MetLife's current payout ratio is 29%, meaning it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for MET for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.32 per share, with earnings expected to increase 21.46% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that MET is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Prices rose about 2% on Tuesday.The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.1% last month after advancing 0.4% in February, the Labor Department said. In the 12 months to March 31 the CPI increased 5%, the smallest year-on-year gain since May 2021.""The weaker U.S. CPI print has raised doubts over whether the Fed will now hike rates at all next month,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at brokerage StoneX. ""Falling interest-rate expectations is reducing recession concerns and helping to support buck-denominated asset prices at the same time.""U.S. President Joe Biden's top economic adviser and ex-Federal Reserve vice chair, Lael Brainard, also said she was seeing inflation coming down.The dollar dropped sharply after the data. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-priced oil cheaper for buyers holding other currencies.Hedge fund were buying oil futures in the market over the past few days in anticipation of improving demand, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.Markets shrugged off a small build in U.S. crude oil stocks, attributing it in part to a congressionally mandated release of oil from the U.S. emergency reserve and lower exports at the start of the month.Crude inventories rose by 597,000 barrels in the last week to 470.5 million, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 600,000-barrel drop. Gasoline and distillate stocks drew less-than-expected.Story continuesA report from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed crude inventories rose by about 380,000 barrels in the last week, while gasoline inventories were also higher, according to sources.Meanwhile, the global oil market could see tightness in the second half of 2023, which would push oil prices higher, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.The top U.S. shale basin has not seen peak production, Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said, while Pioneer Natural Resources chief executive Scott Sheffield said Wednesday that if oil prices break above $90 per barrel, then prices will likely reach $100 per barrel this year.In a negative for oil demand, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday trimmed its 2023 global growth outlook, citing the impact of higher interest rates.The market is also waiting for clarity on oil demand and supply, with monthly reports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the International Energy Agency due on Thursday and Friday, respectively.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Additional reporting by Muyu Xu and Ahmad Ghaddar; Editing by Kirsten Donovan, Matthew Lewis, Leslie Adler and Daniel Wallis)]"

That spells trouble for OPEC nations, which recently announced an unexpected 1 million barrel a day production cut to buoy oil prices and ensure stability in energy markets.The cartel's production cuts still have a significant impact on global energy markets, with crude prices jumping 8% after the cuts were initially announced.""The question is, who's going to win out? Is it going to be the princes, or Powell in terms of the market?"" Croft said, referring to Saudi Arabia, the founding member and top oil producer of OPEC.Tensions between OPEC and the US have been rising since the cartel slashed production by 2 million barrels a day in mid-2022, snubbing President Biden's plea to keep oil prices stable as US inflation continued to soar. Supply cuts were necessary to control ""dysfunction"" in the energy market, Saudi Arabia previously said, claiming that oil prices were disconnected from fundamentals.Croft speculated OPEC would continue to ""stay active"" in controlling energy markets, and could slash production again later this year. She predicted oil prices could rise in the second half of the year, particularly if global oil demand ramps up due to China's reopening and markets heading into colder seasons.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

But this was also in part driven by a 1.6 million barrel draw from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Government data due later in the day is expected to provide more clarity on inventories in the world’s largest oil consumer, with analysts forecasting a 583,000 barrel draw. Inventories have shrunk consistently for the past two weeks, as improving weather conditions across the U.S. spurred increased fuel demand.The prospect of tighter supplies, especially after the OPEC+ cut, kept the near-term outlook for crude markets upbeat.Brent oil futures rose 0.1% to $85.67 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures were flat at $81.55 a barrel by 21:25 ET (01:25 GMT). Both contracts surged 1.6% and 2.2%, respectively, on Tuesday.Focus is now chiefly on U.S. consumer price index data due later on Wednesday, which is expected to show more easing in inflation, albeit slightly. While the reading is still expected to remain well above the Fed’s target range, markets are growing more hopeful that the central bank is closer to pausing its rate hike cycle.But on the other hand, markets also remained wary of any further disruptions to oil demand, especially from slowing economic growth.Data from China showed that inflation grew much lesser than expected in March, indicating a staggered economic recovery in the world’s largest oil importer.Story continuesWith a raft of recent economic readings pointing to a sluggish recovery in China, markets are betting that the government will likely roll out more stimulus measures to help support growth.Focus this week is also on monthly oil market reports from the OPEC and the International Energy Agency.

This compares to production of 20 million tonnes in fiscal 2022.The drop in production stems chiefly from the firm’s Maules Creek mine, which is its biggest coal producer. The mine was hit by adverse weather, including a week-long forest fire in early-March.But Whitehaven also flagged labor shortages at the mine, as well as limited dumping locations for coal waste.Lower production is also expected to result in lower sales, Whitehaven said, with managed coal sales in 2023 now expected at 15.3 to 16 million tonnes, down from the prior forecast of 16.5 to 18 million tonnes.The firm also forecast higher unit costs per tonne of coal mined.Whitehaven is among the largest coal producers in Australia, and benefited from increased demand for the material over the past year, amid growing disruptions in global energy markets.This saw the firm log a fivefold increase in earnings for the six months to December 2022, helped chiefly by a record-high average coal price during the period of A$552 a tonne.But with global energy ructions now beginning to ease, the firm forecast an average coal price of A$400 a tonne for the March quarter. The firm also said it will report coal production of 4.3 million tonnes for the quarter, down from 4.8 million tonnes in the December quarter.Labor shortages are a recurring trend for several Australian companies, as the country grapples with an insufficient supply of skilled workers.

The company is benefiting from growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets. Moreover, a solid rebound in the automotive market remains a positive.Further, the strengthening demand in industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a tailwind. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.However, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds. Further, weakness in the Analog segment of the company is a concern.

The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets acts as a tailwind.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TTE has enough liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations. TTE is making investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, TTE’s production is impacted by the security-related production cuts in some regions. TTE remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production.

The company continues to receive ample orders for its combat-proven defense products and expects both domestic and international program growth to remain robust for its defense business.This should boost the revenue generation prospects for its defense business. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic continues to boost commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for it. The stock holds a solid solvency position.Yet, economic sanctions imposed by governments in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might hurt Raytheon.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.29%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.92%.Heading into today, shares of the customer-management software developer had gained 9.1% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 10.29% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.51% in that time.Salesforce.com will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Salesforce.com to post earnings of $1.61 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 64.29%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.17 billion, up 10.24% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.11 per share and revenue of $34.62 billion, which would represent changes of +35.69% and +10.43%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com should also be noted by investors.

75,3fededc0-b878-3b9b-a0f8-e254bbc9fbf1,CRM,2023-04-12,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-attracting-investor-130001149.html,1681218001,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +9.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 14.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 indicates a change of +23.7% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company invested in renewable energy credits which resulted in 16 of the company's facilities being fully credited with 100% renewable energy as of December 31, 2021.In 2021, SEE operations consumed 1,370,232,395 kilowatt hour (kWh) energy equating to 4,932,836 gigajoules. The breakdown was 55% grid electricity, 12% renewable electricity, and 33% self-generated energy (natural gas, propane, scrap plastic, diesel, gasoline).The goal is to achieve energy intensity reductions of 17% by 2025 and 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.Energy Intensity2021: 0.249 kWh / USD*2020: 0.273 kWh / USD2019: 0.277 kWh / USDThrough 2021, SEE achieved a 10.1% reduction in energy intensity from a 2019 base year. Within its operations, SEE measures electricity, natural gas, diesel, propane, gasoline, and waste-to-energy converted to megawatt hour. Intensity is calculated by dividing the total megawatt hour by the net trade sales.*To normalize foreign exchange rates, net trade sales are adjusted to 2019 foreign exchange rates, except for one currency which has been designated as highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP and uses 2021 foreign exchange rates.Diverting WasteIn 2021, SEE expanded its waste reduction goal to include diversion from external incineration. The company aims to achieve diversion of manufacturing waste* from landfill and external incineration of 85% by 2025 and 100% by 2030.SEE diverted 67% of waste from landfill and external incineration in 2021.*Manufacturing waste is from production of the company's materials, including scrap, and is measured by weight.Conserving WaterSEE is managing water across its value chain in terms of quantity and quality, including operational consumption, effluent mitigation, wastewater treatment, and water scarcity considerations.Story continuesProtecting and conserving natural resources such as water is a priority. The products SEE manufactures do not contain water, so direct use of water is limited. The primary use of water in direct operations is either heat transfer in manufacturing equipment or for quenching the molten polymer during the film extrusion process. These operations must use water of a reasonable quality, but it does not need to be potable.In isolated cases where there was a temporary issue with the availability of potable water, SEE was able to successfully use recycled water from local waste treatment plants. Since it is not critical that potable water is used for manufacturing SEE products, it was determined that the availability of fresh water is not important to SEE's direct operations.Water IntensityThe company's goal is to achieve water intensity reductions of 17% by 2025 and 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. In 2021, SEE achieved a 13.4% reduction in water intensity from a 2019 base year.2021: 0.29 Liters / USD*2020: 0.32 Liters / USD2019: 0.34 Liters / USDIntensity is calculated by dividing the total cubic meters by the net trade sales.*To normalize foreign exchange rates, net trade sales are adjusted to 2019 foreign exchange rates, except for one currency which has been designated as highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP and continues to utilize 2021 foreign exchange rates.Absolute water use in 2021 was down 7,326 cubic meters from 20192021: 1,597,933 cubic meters2020: 1,595,017 cubic meters2019: 1,605,259 cubic metersRead Sealed Air's Global Impact Report here.Learn More About Sealed Air's ESG efforts here.Sealed Air, Tuesday, April 11, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Sealed Air on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Sealed AirWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sealed-airEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Sealed AirView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/748531/Sealed-Air-Global-Impact-Report-Reducing-Energy-Consumption]"

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is PVH (PVH). PVH is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 8.34, while its industry has an average P/E of 12.55. Over the past 52 weeks, PVH's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.27 and as low as 5.38, with a median of 7.34.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PVH has a P/S ratio of 0.6. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.63.Investors could also keep in mind Ralph Lauren (RL), an Textile - Apparel stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of Ralph Lauren are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 12.09 and a PEG ratio of 1.30 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 12.55 and 1.74, respectively.Over the last 12 months, RL's P/E has been as high as 14.84, as low as 10, with a median of 11.94, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 4.05, as low as 1.13, with a median of 2.98.Story continuesRalph Lauren sports a P/B ratio of 3 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 6.63. In the past 52 weeks, RL's P/B has been as high as 3.42, as low as 2.40, with a median of 2.92.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that PVH and Ralph Lauren are likely being undervalued right now.

Gavin Newsom and the Legislature opened the way for PG&amp;E to seek an extended lifespan for the twin reactors. The company intends to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of the year to extend operations by as much as two decades.The operating license for the Unit 1 reactor expires next year and the Unit 2 license expires in 2025.Hallie Templeton, legal director for Friends of the Earth, said in a statement that “PG&amp;E has been acting as if our contract has disappeared.”California is the birthplace of the modern environmental movement that for decades has had a fraught relationship with nuclear power, which doesn’t produce carbon pollution like fossil fuels but leaves behind waste that can remain dangerously radioactive for centuries. The Newsom administration is pushing to expand solar power and other clean energy, as the state aims to cut emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.Newsom’s decision last year to support a longer operating run for Diablo Canyon shocked environmentalists and anti-nuclear advocates because he had once been a leading voice for closing the plant.PG&amp;E said in a statement it had not yet seen the lawsuit, but that as a regulated utility will follow state policy.The lawsuit marks the latest development in a long-running fight over the operation and safety of the decades-old plant, which Newsom says should keep running beyond 2025 to ward off possible blackouts as California transitions to solar and other renewable energy sources.Story continuesDiablo Canyon produces 9% of the state’s electricity.At issue in the lawsuit is how a complex 2016 agreement figures in the Legislature’s decision reverse itself and to try and keep the reactors running. At the time the agreement to wind down Diablo Canyon was made, California utility regulators, the Legislature and then-Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown agreed to the closure.The complaint describes the 2016 agreement as a “contract,” and asks the court to find it binding. It also asks for an order prohibiting PG&amp;E from violating the contract.“PG&amp;E acts as if it has no remaining contractual obligations,” the complaint said, while asserting that the utility still has a responsibility to retire the nuclear power plant on schedule.It’s not clear if the reactors will continue operating beyond the expiration of their 2024 and 2025 licenses — and if so, for how long — since many regulatory milestones and unanswered questions remain. Last year, PG&amp;E CEO Patricia “Patti” Poppe warned that the “permitting and relicensing of the facility is complex and so there’s a lot of hurdles to be overcome.”For example, it's not yet publicly known what it will cost to update the plant for a longer run given that the company was preparing to close it for years. The state could consider backing out if capital costs climb over $1.4 billion and a string of state agencies also has to review extending the plant's lifespan.Construction at Diablo Canyon began in the 1960s. Critics say potential shaking from nearby earthquake faults not recognized when the design was approved could damage equipment and release radiation. One fault was not discovered until 2008. PG&amp;E has long said the plant is safe, an assessment the NRC has supported.The U.S. nuclear industry has been through a tough stretch, with reactors retiring and its share of energy production slipping since 2012. But many industry leaders see a renaissance on the horizon, as climate change has brought attention to carbon-free power.The Biden administration last year launched a $6 billion effort to rescue nuclear power plants at risk of closing, citing the need for nuclear energy as a carbon-free power source that helps to combat climate change.The lawsuit also named labor groups from the plant that were involved in the 2016 agreement as defendants, including the Coalition Of California Utility Employees.]"

Now key cloud companies lagging behind today, along with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Snowflake, all moving to the downside. Weakness in the cloud was something we started to hear about during last earnings season, Josh, when we started to see some of these larger names post smaller growth numbers. That was clearly concern there for analysts at the time. It looks like it might be a little bit longer of a runway here until we start to see things turn around.- Yeah, UBS talked to over 20 different large consumers of these products, and I thought it was interesting to see that they had seen a more of a tick down since they last talked to them three months ago. You noted that AWS and Azure, we had already seen a slowdown. So to continue to see that slowdown will be interesting to see how that translates to earnings in a couple of weeks. Their specific point on Microsoft I thought was interesting, too, Seana, talking about just the Microsoft stock price we're showing. They're up almost 20% year to date.And their argument for Microsoft basically being that AI unit is already priced in. So you already have the price in there with that 20% bump. Now you're looking at a Azure, which was sort of the growth story before, and that might be slowing down. So then what does that mean for the outlook of Microsoft? It gets a little bit murkier when we get outside that AI hype train. Although, it is pretty exciting.- It is exciting. I know, AI was certainly the buzzword of last earnings season. We'll see whether or not that's a tech buzz word of this earnings season. You got to think a lot of these companies are going to be mentioning that quite a few times, right, Josh? Great job.

The White House declined to comment.Major U.S. manufacturers of abortion pills include GenBioPro Inc and Danco Laboratories.

At the same time, the Dow added 0.29%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.92%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the coffee chain had gained 5.71% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 6.84% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.51% in that time.Starbucks will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Starbucks is projected to report earnings of $0.63 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 6.78%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.39 billion, up 9.88% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.41 per share and revenue of $35.86 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.2% and +11.18%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% lower. Starbucks is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note Starbucks's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 30.75. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 24.39, which means Starbucks is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that SBUX has a PEG ratio of 1.78. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

This comes as investors are increasingly concerned about the environmental, social, and governance aspects of the companies they put their money behind. Thus, many companies have seized the opportunity to project the best possible image, to increase demand for their shares.The environmental portion of that trifecta has become especially important, with many firms opting to project greener images. Naturally, some of these firms exaggerated the truth regarding their efforts as environmental champions.High-profile scandals ensued, with companies like Volkswagen (VWAGY:OTCMKTS) being caught committing outright fraud. The companies listed below may not have acted as egregiously. However, these are companies that will likely face increasing scrutiny as the pendulum swings toward true sustainability long-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHNNMYHennes Mauritz$2.86KOCoca-Cola$62.84SBUXStarbucks$104.68Hennes Mauritz (HNNMY)A hand reaches for an article of clothing on a hanger from a rack labeled XL.Source: christinarosepix / Shutterstock.comHennes Mauritz (OTCMKTS:HNNMY) isn’t likely to mean anything to readers at first blush. It isn’t a household name to be sure. But it’ll become more apparent when I tell you that Hennes Mauritz is better known as H&amp;M.H&amp;M is one of a group of clothing retailers broadly referred to as fast fashion brands. There are several reasons to avoid these companies and their stocks, if greenwashing and ESG is among your primary concerns.For one, fast fashion brands are known to make lower-quality clothing that doesn’t last long. It’s cheaper, but at a cost to the environment. The short lifespan of this clothing means that the textiles turn into waste much quicker. Hennes Mauritz doesn’t necessarily advertise its fast fashion as environmentally friendly. But it did market a ‘green’ line of clothing under the name ‘conscious’ at one point. The catch is that those are simply marketing buzzwords, lacking legal definitions.Story continuesEven if H&amp;M and other fast fashion brands don’t actively market their green initiatives, they will likely face increased scrutiny, due to the speed at which their garments become trash.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comI’ll be clear: I generally favor Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock as an investment. The company’s ability to maintain a steady share price throughout all stages of the business cycle is advantageous to long-term investors. Additionally, KO stock is an outstanding option for investors seeking income, considering the company’s dividend growth profile historically. Those factors make Coca-Cola a buy in this age of volatility and recession concerns.However, at the same time, I have to admit that Coca-Cola isn’t an environmentally-friendly company. Unsurprisingly, Coca-Cola’s plastic bottles used in its wide swath of products creates a tremendous amount of plastic waste globally. Thus, it might not be surprising to discover that Coca-Cola has been named the worst plastic polluter for the fifth straight year in 2022.Coca-Cola is focused on making its plastic packaging more recyclable. Currently, 90% of its packaging is recyclable, with a goal of 100% by 2025. But only 61% of the bottles and cans it put into the market in 2021 were reused or collected for recycling. Thus, 39% of that packaging immediately became waste. And of that 61% that gets recycled, how much was actually reused?Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock faces many of the same ESG issues that plague Coca-Cola. Both companies create massive amounts of waste, while being highly-successful beverage companies.In 2018, Starbucks banned single-use plastic straws in favor of straw-less lids. The lid used more plastic but was recyclable, unlike the straws. Predictably, consumers pointed out that those lids wouldn’t necessarily be recycled. Thus, environmental advocates claimed Starbucks was making the problem worse by failing to consider the decision thoroughly.More recently, Starbucks committed to eliminating PFAS from its U.S. packaging in 2022 and internationally by 2023. PFAS chemicals do not break down in the environment, and have been linked to several health problems.Ultimately, eliminating PFAS chemicals from packaging is a good thing. Starbucks is doing the right thing. But it still creates significant amounts of plastic waste and paper, too. Its paper cups are only recyclable in 4 U.S. cities due to their plastic lining. That’s not good for the environment, or for investors looking to hone in on Starbucks as an ESG option.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Parker-Hannifin is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Idex has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PH is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.94, while IEX has a forward P/E of 24.80. We also note that PH has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. IEX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.07.Another notable valuation metric for PH is its P/B ratio of 4.29. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, IEX has a P/B of 5.38.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help PH earn a Value grade of B, while IEX has been given a Value grade of D.PH has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than IEX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that PH is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, the company has been on track with the Readiness goals of driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers’ experience.Additionally, an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. Earnings estimates for ADM’s current financial year have increased 1.2% to $6.74 over the past 60 days.Let’s Delve DeeperArcher Daniels has long been gaining from the robust performance in its Nutrition segment. In fourth-quarter 2022, revenues in the segment rose 7.3% year over year and 11% on a cc basis. Although the Human Nutrition unit remained dismal year over year, the Health &amp; Wellness business witnessed growth, driven by the bioactives portfolio, including the results of the Deerland acquisition.The Flavors unit gained from strong revenue growth, which somewhat offset demand-fulfillment challenges. Specialty Ingredients continued to witness solid demand for its product portfolio, including plant-based proteins. Management expects the Nutrition unit to remain positive in 2023, with more than 10% profit growth. Also, we expect revenues in this segment to grow 10% year over year in 2023.In response to the growing trends for all things sustainable, Archer Daniels has been making efforts to expand its solutions portfolio, which forms part of its Carbohydrate Solutions unit. It collaborated with LG Chem to produce lactic and polylactic acids for bioplastics, which is a plant-based product. Earlier, the company launched Biosolutions to expand its portfolio of sustainable higher-margin solutions, particularly for pharmaceuticals and personal care markets.Such endeavors are likely to help attain 10% revenue growth on an annual basis. In a recent development, Archer Daniels entered a joint venture with Gevo to help meet the demand for low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel. It also shut down its ethanol facility in Peoria last October. The company is utilizing innovative technologies to develop products and boost operating capabilities.As part of its readiness efforts, the company introduced a company-wide simplification initiative.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$89.65 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$74.26. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Archer-Daniels-Midland's current trading price of US$78.74 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Archer-Daniels-Midland’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland What Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 4.06% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Archer-Daniels-Midland today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $75.67, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Archer-Daniels-Midland’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Archer-Daniels-Midland look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Archer-Daniels-Midland, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, ADM appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ADM for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on ADM should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you want to dive deeper into Archer-Daniels-Midland, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

109,617c04e7-54c3-399d-a1ec-a33a20cf4ff4,PM,2023-04-12,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-philip-morris-130001200.html,1681218001,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned +1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Tobacco industry, to which Philip Morris belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share, indicating a change of -14.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.5%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.82 indicates a change of +8.1% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Philip Morris.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.88 billion and $36.63 billion estimates indicate +9.8% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.15 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.39 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.98%. The EPS surprise was +7.75%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

115,c54d65a9-086f-38b3-b58c-3c3b18721e73,SPG,2023-04-12,The 7 Best REITs to Buy for April 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-reits-buy-april-201548147.html,1680898548,STORY,"['IIPR', 'SACH', 'PSTL', 'NSA', 'SPG', 'OFC', 'LTC']","[With more signs emerging that interest rate hikes are about to ease (then possibly move lower), you may be thinking now’s the time to jump back into real estate investment trusts, or REITs. The question, then, is what are the best REITs to buy?REITs have been hammered during the rising rate environment of the past year, but many remain richly-priced. Others sell at low valuation, yet have property-type and/or REIT-specific issues that make them unappealing as investments.However, amid the hundreds of REITs available for sale in the public markets, there are a few standouts that hit the sweet spot. That is, these REITs offer high, sustainable yields. In addition, due to low valuations, and/or growth catalysts, they have strong potential to appreciate in value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s the story here with these seven best REITs. A mix of small and large names from across the REIT investing universe, for income and growth, consider adding these real estate stocks to your portfolio this month.IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$72.75LTCLTC Properties$34.02NSANational Storage Affiliates$42.84OFCCorporate Office Properties Trust$23.64PSTLPostal Realty Trust$15.14SACHSachem Capital$3.70SPGSimon Property Group$109.77Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)A close-up shot of a marijuana growhouse.Source: ShutterstockInnovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) may sound at first like a run-of-the-mill warehouse owner, but there’s a reason why the word “innovative” is in this REIT’s corporate name. IIPR leases specialized properties to state-licensed cannabis growers.IIPR stock was a high-flier when both cannabis plays and REITs were in vogue. Yet with the change in sentiment for both types of stocks, IIPR has been hammered to significantly lower prices. However, IIPR’s price/funds from operations (P/FFO) ratio of 9.7-times may now more-than-reflect the impact of higher interest rates, not to mention concerns like a declining rent collection rate.Story continuesAs seen in its latest investor presentation, this REIT continues to add new properties and diversify its tenant base. This, in time, could play a role in mitigating this risk. With a forward dividend yield of 9.9%, which is approaching the double-digits, investors should consider buying IIPR stock for both value and yield.LTC Properties (LTC)A nurse is helping a older woman. Elder care. Senior care.Source: Rido / ShutterstockLTC Properties (NYSE:LTC) owns a portfolio of senior housing and skilled nursing facility (or SNF) properties. During 2022, as it became apparent that the REIT’s pandemic-related headwinds were behind it, and occupancy rates were again rising, shares appeared set on making a few recovery back to pre-2020 prices. However, LTC stock has since pulled back in more recent months.Still, while LTC stock keeps struggling, there’s something else that could spark a major comeback, and a move to even higher prices. As InvestorPlace’s Ian Bezek recently argued, this REIT benefits from a major demographic change. That would be the baby boomer generation’s full move into Medicare/retirement age, coupled with rising longevity.This stands to drive continued strong demand for LTC’s properties. With this in mind, LTC (which currently yields 6.7%) may be one of the best REITs to buy now, as a holding for this decade and the next.National Storage Affiliates (NSA)A photo of a storage facility hallway.Source: Kostsov / Shutterstock.comIf recession worries have you worried, self-storage REITs are a great choice. Self-storage is generally regarded as a more recession-proof area of commercial real estate. Within the sector, National Storage Affiliates (NYSE:NSA) stands out as a strong choice.That’s mostly because NSA stock is cheaper, and offers a higher dividend yield, relative to comparable REITs. Whereas large, well-known competitor Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) trades at a P/FFO ratio of 18.5-times, and has a forward dividend yield of 3.9%, NSA trades at a P/FFO ratio of 15.1-tiomes, and has a forward dividend yield of 5.1%.Also, National Storage Affiliates has a strong track record of dividend growth. This REIT has raised its dividend seven years in a row, and the payout has grown by an average of 15.3% annually over the past five years. For value, yield, and dividend growth to boot, consider NSA stock.Corporate Office Properties Trust (OFC)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockYou don’t have to look far to find headlines that are bearish about the commercial office property market. As such, you may at first be skeptical that Corporate Office Properties Trust (NYSE:OFC) is one of the best REITs to buy right now.However, while the name may initially scare you off, taking a look at the details, you may quickly discover that OFC stock may be able to ride out the current office space downturn. That would be this REIT’s focus on leasing space to the U.S. Government and defense contractors.This steady tenant base, coupled with the growing push to bring federal employees back into the office, bodes well for OFC. While OFC’s dividend yield (4.82%) isn’t super-high, its valuation (P/FFO of 10-times) is too low, given its greater resiliency potential than other office REITs. Erroneously bid lower alongside more vulnerable REITs, seize the opportunity with OFC stock.Postal Realty Trust (PSTL)photo of a silver mailbox with red flag up and mail insider, house in backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/Aina JameelaAfter looking at OFC, let’s dive into another REIT collecting rent checks from Uncle Sam. Postal Realty Trust (NYSE:PSTL), as its name suggests, owns a portfolio of properties leased out to the United States Postal Service.Right off the bat, PSTL stock comes across as a “boring” investment that could pay off handsomely over time. This REIT’s shares have a forward dividend yield of 6.3%. That’s not all. Dividend and share price growth could arrive over time. Why? As I have argued previously, Postal Realty Trust has one big factor in its corner: there’s yet to be a big consolidation wave with postal properties.Given it’s the sole publicly-traded REIT in this space, Postal Realty Trust has a greater opportunity to continue what it does best – make accretive acquisitions of postal properties, providing investors with large payouts. Consider it time to start collecting mailbox money (figuratively and literally) with PSTL stock.Sachem Capital (SACH)Toy houses rest atop stacks of coins while a hand dangles a set of keys in the air.Source: ShutterstockThere are plenty of high-yielding mortgage REITs out there, but Sachem Capital (NYSE:SACH) is one that stands out as one of the best REITs to buy. Mostly, because unlike your standard mortgage REIT, Sachem focuses on a niche area of the space: short-term “hard money” loans to real estate investors for acquisition/renovation projects.Thus far, this focus has enabled this REIT to continue reporting strong results, even in a challenging environment for real estate lenders. This resiliency may continue. In turn, enabling SACH to keep its dividend payout at or near present levels.Also, alongside strong potential for continued double-digit yields, shares may have the potential to make big gains. Assuming that Sachem rides out today’s uncertainty, when the bull market returns, shares may be able to close the gap between book value ($5.30 per share) and trading price ($3.70 per share).Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLike with office building REITs, investors are also very pessimistic about shopping mall REITs. This is a big reason why you can scoop up Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) today at a relatively low valuation.SPG stock currently trades at a P/FFO ratio of 9.2-times, and has a forward yield of 6.6%. The investing public may be pessimistic about this mall REIT’s prospects, but dig a little deeper, and you’ll find justification to go against the grain. As a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, Simon Property Group continues to perform well, and its dividend (payout ratio under 60%) is sustainable.Furthermore, SPG is making the right moves to stay thriving and profitable. Besides owning a portfolio largely of Class A malls in economically robust locations, this mall REIT is also modernizing its properties, by adding more outdoor areas and mixed use space.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

116,016689f6-1f25-3826-9c11-a259fb36c60b,HCA,2023-04-12,4 Stocks in Focus as Hospital Industry Witnesses Improvement,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-focus-hospital-industry-123912611.html,1681216752,STORY,"['HCA', 'THC', 'UHS', 'ACHC', '^GSPC']","[After facing multiple issues for several quarters, hospital companies are witnessing improving market conditions thanks to the easing staffing challenges and increasing non-Covid utilization. As serious medical conditions continue to rise, outpatient surgeries and patient days are likely to increase, boosting Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players’ revenues. However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to provide companies with a competitive edge and improve efficiency. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC should benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services. Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryRising Patient Volumes: With declining COVID-related utilization of resources, non-COVID admissions are expected to grow. As serious medical conditions are rising, demand for elective procedures is likely to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements, and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide patients with some respite, which can help them navigate tough times.Story continuesGrowing Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. By 2034, older adults are expected to outnumber children, a first in the country’s history. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Advancements: Technological improvements, innovations and wider adoption will continue to support hospital players. This should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future. The companies are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The industry players are using the virtual health domain to enhance efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and reducing their treatment costs.Rising Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. Increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. However, improving labor shortages and staffing challenges will provide hospital companies some breathing room. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Promising ScenarioThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #103, which places it in the top 41% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 4.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 7.1% and the Zacks Medical sector’s decrease of 15.2%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.90X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.55X and the sector’s 8.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.05X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.80X, as the charts below show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Stocks Worth Your AttentionWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. Its inorganic growth strategies enable it to persistently expand its network across several markets, increase patient volumes and add more hospitals to its portfolio. Its telemedicine business line is expected to continue benefiting operations. HCA Healthcare also focuses on boosting shareholders’ value with dividend hikes and buybacks.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 EPS indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 3.9% increase from a year ago. HCA beat earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters and missed on two occasions, the average surprise being 2.3%. Shares of the company have jumped 9.7% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: HCAUniversal Health Services: The company operates acute care facilities, and outpatient and behavioral health care units. It focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues. UHS’ plans to add new capacities in hospitals in important markets of Texas and California to address strong acute care demand are expected to be major tailwinds. It has a strong share buyback plan in place to boost shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health’s 2023 bottom line indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 5.2% increase from a year ago. UHS beat earnings estimates thrice in the past four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 0.2%. Shares of the company have risen 11% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: UHSAcadia Healthcare: ACHC provides behavioral healthcare services in the United States and Puerto Rico. It has been emphasizing on buyouts and new additions for robust growth. Acquisitions added facilities, beds and hospitals to Acadia Healthcare’s network and contributed to its top line. It is also actively pursuing joint ventures with renowned healthcare systems, which is helping it expand its capabilities through bed additions. The company plans to add roughly 300 beds through facility expansions and open a minimum of six CTCs in 2023. Its moves to streamline its portfolio boost operating efficiency and profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC’s 2023 bottom line indicates 9.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 9.6% increase from a year ago. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed estimates on another occasion, the average surprise being 2.5%.

THC has made several acquisitions, and formed strategic partnerships and alliances to augment the scale of business, operating capacity and geographical presence. Tenet Healthcare’s performance has been aided by USPI Holding Company’s (Ambulatory Care) operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THC’s 2023 bottom line is pegged at $5.15 per share, which remained stable over the past month. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 3.7% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 65.2%.

(NYSE:PPG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PPG Industries. Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PPG Industries?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that PPG Industries does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PPG Industries' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PPG Industries. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.8% and 6.5% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PPG IndustriesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that PPG Industries, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$56m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in PPG Industries. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will be a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end markets with weak business conditions.PPG Industries is on track to raise selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of rising raw material costs. The company intends to completely recover the cost inflation experienced since 2021, with continued price hikes beginning in 2023. This is likely to strengthen its margins in 2023.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance in 2023. Buyouts, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line this year.PPG Industries also remains committed to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It has raised the annual dividend payout for 51 consecutive years. In 2022, the company returned around $570 million to shareholders through dividends and about $190 million through share repurchases.PPG Industries recently raised its earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2023 factoring in higher volumes and prices. The company now sees adjusted earnings for the first quarter in the range of $1.52-$1.58 per share. It exceeds its previously announced outlook of $1.10-$1.20.The company said that it witnessed an increased pace of recovery in its operating margin during the first quarter, which is attributed to higher sales volumes and improved selling prices. PPG's sales volume exceeded its guidance, with significant contributions from its aerospace and automotive original equipment manufacturer coatings businesses.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.7%.Revenues are expected to be $13.21 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.04% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goldman?For Goldman, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.62%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Goldman will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goldman would post earnings of $5.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.32, delivering a surprise of -36.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Goldman appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +18.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.18 billion, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The Charles Schwab Corporation has been revised 13.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.11%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Charles Schwab Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

The same for GPN’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $8.6 billion, indicating a 5.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $8.1 billion.TailwindsGlobal Payments is a Fortune 500 leading payments technology company providing software and services to financial institutions across 170 countries. Growing demand for digital payments should aid the company’s revenue growth in the future.The company also earns through software subscription and licensing fees. Growth in customer base, accelerating use of digital payments and ongoing recovery from the pandemic should boost growth in future.GPN has been witnessing growth in revenues over the last few years, banking on improving volumes. Merchant Solutions contributed 69.1% to the total revenues in 2022, and this figure is expected to grow further as transaction fees will boost on the back of volume growth. The company projects adjusted net revenues within $8,575-$8,675 million this year, indicating 6-7% growth from the 2022 reported figure.The company does not hesitate to boost its global footprint with ambitious acquisitions. It acquired EVO Payments, Inc. in August 2022, a leading payments and services provider offering a plethora of solutions to merchants in the United States and Europe. This acquisition expands GPN’s geographic presence, supplements its business-to-business and most importantly, supports its technology-based payments strategy.Story continuesGlobal Payments divested the consumer portion of its Netspend business, aiming to focus on its core corporate customers. The company also entered into a definitive agreement to sell its gaming business. This highlights the company’s unwavering focus on building up its core operations. These moves should lead to lower expenses and improve the bottom line in future.GPN focuses on top-tier strategic partnerships to grow its business. It has partnered with Mastercard to improve the dispute resolution process for more than 25 million car owners. The company has also inked a deal with Mondu to serve financial services customers across use cases, like prepaid cards, lending solutions and credit cards.The company’s financial flexibility enables it to invest in technology, strategic partnerships and return capital to shareholders. GPN exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,997.6 million, way above the current portion of long-term debt of $1,169.3 million. It returned more than $3 billion in 2022 via share repurchases and dividends.An increase in the capacity of the company’s share buyback program was made to bring the total authorization amount to $1.5 billion. Hence, a strong financial position remains an additional tailwind for Global Payments. This should instill confidence in shareholders.The company has a VGM Score of B.Key ConcernsHowever, there are a few factors that have been impeding the stock’s growth lately.The performance of Consumer Solutions segment is a concern. This segment is delivering poor performance due to reduced consumer spending and volumes.Rising operating expenses are also harming the company’s margins. Despite cost management efforts, operating expenses rose 16.3% year over year. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Financial Transaction Services space are Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated DBD, International Money Express, Inc.

BIO is gaining from robust growth in Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics arms. Solid prospects in the blood typing market and the company’s focus on the international market look encouraging.In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have gained 22.4% compared with the 10.2% rise of the industry and a 14.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned manufacturer and global supplier of clinical diagnostics and life science research products has a market capitalization of $13.89 billion.In the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 25.3%, way ahead of the industry’s 9.6%. The company’s earnings have surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 27.54%.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors.Factors At PlayFocus on International Markets: Bio-Rad has been deriving more than 60% of its net sales from international markets. The company experienced double-digit currency neutral year-over-year core revenue growth in the Americas and Asia, while Europe posted a more modest increase, primarily reflecting ongoing supply chain constraints for diagnostic products. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group’s year-over-year currency-neutral core revenues rose in the Americas. Within Cinical Diagnostics, currency neutral full-year core revenues grew in the Americas and Europe.Segmental Growth:  Despite supply chain constraints, the underlying Life Science year-over-year currency-neutral core revenue growth was 28.1%. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by Droplet Digital PCR, process chromatography and Western blotting. The company also witnessed good growth for the qPCR products, in part driven by the uptake of the new CFX Opus platform. The company continued to experience strong initial customer interest and demand for the recently introduced QX600 ddPCR system. Bio-Rad also expects a more meaningful revenue contribution from this platform in 2023.Story continuesClinical Diagnostics Continue to Gain Momentum: During fourth-quarter 2022, on a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group’s year-over-year currency neutral core revenue grew in the Americas and declined in Europe and in Asia. Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products for 2022 were up 0.4% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding COVID-related sales, Clinical Diagnostic year-over-year currency neutral core revenue growth was 1.3%, which was impacted by supply chain constraints.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrong Solvency and Balance Sheet: Bio-Rad exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of 1.79 billion compared with $875.5 million at the end of 2021. Total debt (including current maturities) at the end of 2022 was $1.19 billion compared with $11 million at the end of 2021.This figure is much lower than the quarter-end cash and cash equivalent and investments level, indicating strong solvency. This is good news in terms of the solvency position of the company, at least during the economic downturn, implying that the company is holding sufficient cash for debt repayment.Estimate TrendsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bio-Rad’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $15.91, suggesting a 10.3% rise from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pinned at $2.95 billion, indicating a 5.2% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

ECL is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance, along with its strong business, is expected to contribute further. Compliance risks and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 7.5% compared with a 5.1% decline of the industry and a 7.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services provider has a market capitalization of $47.24 billion. It projects 12.7% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain a strong performance. Ecolab’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missed the same in one and matched in the other, the average earnings surprise being 0.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Portfolio Solid: We are upbeat about Ecolab’s solid product portfolio, which has enabled it to fortify its foothold in a niche space globally. Ecolab delivers comprehensive solutions, data-driven insights and personalized service to advance food safety and maintain clean and safe environments.The company also provides products and services that optimize water and energy use, and improve operational efficiencies and sustainability for customers in the food, healthcare, hospitality and industrial markets in more than 170 countries around the world.Strong Business: Ecolab’s consistent delivery of considerable earnings growth despite the current challenging business environment continues to impress. Ecolab witnessed a strong fourth-quarter 2022, which reflected strong sales growth with double-digit pricing despite substantial delivered product cost inflation. Per management, the volumes outside Europe remained stable year over year, while the total pricing continued to accelerate on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter.Story continuesOn the fourth-quarter earnings call in February, management also stated that Ecolab’s net new business pipeline reached a record high at the end of 2022.Strong Q4 Results: Ecolab’s solid fourth-quarter results buoy our optimism. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its top line and solid performances across all its segments. Strong volume and pricing momentum were also seen. The company’s digital capabilities are also continuing to broaden, develop and add competitive advantages. During the quarter, Purolite delivered a very strong performance, benefiting from its recent capacity additions.DownsidesCompliance Risks: Ecolab’s business is subjected to various laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards and the conduct of its business. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes the company to potential financial liability and increases operating costs.Data Security Threat: Ecolab relies, to a large extent, upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate its business. The size and complexity of the company’s information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure, malicious intrusion and random attacks. Acquisitions have resulted in further de-centralization of systems and additional complexity in its systems infrastructure.Estimate TrendEcolab is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Hologic is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

BAX recently announced the U.S. launch of ZOSYN (piperacillin and tazobactam) Injection. Zosyn premix, indicated for treating multiple infections caused by susceptible bacteria, is available in Baxter’s proprietary single-dose Galaxy containers (a non-PVC and non-DEHP system that enables premixed medications to have a longer shelf life).Baxter will be selling Zosyn premix in 2.25 g in 50 mL, 3.375 g in 50 mL and 4.5 g in 100 mL presentations.The latest launch is expected to significantly boost Baxter’s portfolio of anti-infective medications under the Pharmaceuticals, solidifying its foothold in the niche space across the nation.Significance of the LaunchThe use of premixes (ready-to-use formats of standard doses of commonly prescribed drugs) is expected to offer operational efficiencies for healthcare providers. Compounding a drug for patient use is a multi-step, manual process that requires oversight by pharmacy staff.A ready-to-use product like Zosyn premix can simplify the preparation process and aid in improving patient safety by reducing the chances of contamination and avoiding potential dosing errors that may occur when medications are compounded.Per management, the provision of an additional frozen premix option will likely aid in supporting patient safety and offer added convenience for healthcare providers.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Data Bridge Market Research, the global market for anti-infective drugs was estimated to be $135 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $184.7 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 4%. Factors like increasing awareness about infectious diseases and growing demand for oral drugs are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is likely to provide a significant boost to Baxter’s business on a national scale.Notable DevelopmentsIn February, Baxter announced its fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein it registered a robust uptick in year-over-year revenues on a reported, constant currency and operational basis (excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hill-Rom).

IDXX has been gaining from the ongoing strength in the company’s Companion Animal Group (CAG) business. The company’s strong growth globally buoys optimism. However, foreign exchange headwinds and escalating expenses do not bode well.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have lost 8.2% compared with the industry’s 15% fall. The S&amp;P 500 fell 7.5% during the same period.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $39.20 billion. The long-term expected growth rate is estimated at 18%, compared with the industry’s growth expectation of 15.9%.Let’s delve deeper.Q4 Upsides: IDEXX exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a decent note, with earnings and revenues beating estimates. The company registered year-over-year growth in revenues on a reported and organic basis. The top line was driven by continued benefits from the expansion of IDEXX's global premium instrument installed base. CAG Diagnostics’ organic recurring revenue growth reflects solid gains across IDEXX's major modalities globally, supported by growth in clinical service demand and expanded utilization of diagnostic products and services.Strong Global Performance: IDEXX continues to demonstrate solid growth globally. International revenues in primarily aided by a gain in CAG and Water businesses.CAG premium instrument placements increased 13% in the fourth quarter, reflecting double-digit gains across the catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. The company placed 5,065 premium instruments in the fourth quarter. The quality of placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 3% global gains in new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 7% gains in the U.S. The company also witnessed a 5% growth in new and competitive premium hematology placements globally, leveraging strong customer interest in ProCyte One.Global Lab revenues increased 8% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the United States led by improved organic growth in international regions.Story continuesCAG Continues to Perform Well: IDEXX derives the lion’s share of its revenues from the CAG segment. The company registered stellar third-quarter revenue growth within CAG.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 9% in the fourth quarter continues to outpace sector growth trends. IDEXX' U.S. performance was supported by a 1,200 basis point growth benefit from IDEXX execution drivers, including approximately 7% net price gains and continued solid growth contributions from customer additions and leverage of IDEXX innovation.CAG Diagnostic’s recurring revenues were supported by relatively higher levels of net price realization, including benefits from the second-half price initiatives. IDEXX estimates net price changes contributed around 7% to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwind: The majority of IDEXX’s consolidated revenues are derived from the sale of products in international markets. Thus, strengthening of the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies dented the company’s revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits from products manufactured in the United States and sold internationally.Weak Solvency and Capital Structure: IDEXX exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $112.5 million compared with $144.5 million recorded at the end of 2021. Total debt (including the current portion) at the end of 2022 was $769.4 million compared with a total debt of $850.2 million at the end of 2021. However, if we consider the current debt at the end of the quarter, it was less than the quarter-end cash balance.Estimate TrendsIDEXX has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2023. For the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDEXX’s 2023 earnings has moved 1.8% north to $9.57.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.63 billion, suggesting 7.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Interestingly, Warner Bros Discovery owns more than a dozen cable networks.The Warner Bros reveal event will be just over an hour and feature no stars. The event will unveil the new service's name, marketing plans, technological upgrades, and some TV series and movie announcements.Warner Bros expects the streaming division to break even by next year and be profitable in two years.Warner Bros still has a subscriber goal for its streaming division of 130 million by 2025, up from the 96.1 million now trailing Netflix's current total of 231 million and Disney's 235 million subscribers.Parrot Analytics analyst Julia Alexander expects Warner Bros' move to help with time spent on the app as the company bets on unscripted programming to drive engagement.Higher engagement will help the company raise the price without fearing user churn and increase revenue from advertisers on the streaming service's lower-priced tier.Price Action: WBD shares traded lower by 1.56% at $15.16 on the last check Tuesday.Story continuesDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis internet video service is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.4%.Revenues are expected to be $8.18 billion, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.16% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Netflix?For Netflix, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Netflix will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Netflix would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of -74.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Netflix doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below, we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierThe screener yields winning stocks like W.W. Grainger (GWW), Olympic Steel (ZEUS), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Veritiv (VRTV) and Phillips 66 (PSX).Why Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environments.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks. However, when looking for lower-priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.

After generating historic profits in 2022, ExxonMobil has been exploring opportunities that could reshape the U.S. energy industry, while pushing it deeper into West Texas shale.The acquisition will offer ExxonMobil a leading position in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, an area crucial to its growth plans. The acquisition will likely be ExxonMobil’s largest merger after the one with Mobil Corporation in 1999.ExxonMobil has been looking to make a purchase in the Permian Basin for months. The company’s interest in U.S. shale indicates that the oil giant may continue to tie its future opportunities to fossil fuels, possibly for decades.Pioneer is the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin. In 2022, Pioneer produced an average of 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the basin. This is about 100,000 more than what ExxonMobil produced in the region last year.Pioneer owns some of the high-quality assets in the Permian Basin. Pioneer’s recent acquisitions can stand for about 30 years of premium inventory. With the acquisition, ExxonMobil will have a vast inventory of economic drilling locations Pioneer gathered through the acquisitions of Parsley Energy Inc. and DoublePoint Energy, which had also drilled in the Permian Basin.ExxonMobil’s strategy to focus on its oil and gas assets proved profitable last year. The company generated a record profit of $55.7 billion, which made it one of America’s most prosperous companies in fiscal 2022.The acquisition will merge the largest Western oil company with a Texas shale driller holding vast reserves of oil in America’s most-coveted fracking hot spot. However, the potential talks may not lead to formal negotiations and ExxonMobil may opt for another company.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of ExxonMobil have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

Lower-than-expected quarterly earnings were driven by a decline in contributions from the Chemicals segment. The negatives were partially offset by strong refining margins worldwide.Phillips 66 received approval from the board of directors to hike its dividend. The new quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share reflects an increase of 8.2% from the previous quarter’s 97 cents and a 14% hike from the year-ago quarter’s 92 cents.Enterprise Products Partners’ EPD fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per limited partner unit of 65 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents. Strong quarterly earnings were driven by higher contributions from the NGL and Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services businesses.Enterprise Products Partners is strongly committed to returning cash to shareholders.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 78%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-favorite-140018577.html,1681221618,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Amgen's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessA look at the shareholders of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Amgen. See our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Amgen. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amgen's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amgen. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.0% and 5.6% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AmgenWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Amgen Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$210m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Amgen  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

It also offered a franked special dividend of up to $1.10 per share and said it needs unanimous board support for the offer to proceed.Newcrest's board, which in February unanimously rejected Newmont's previous offer of 0.380 shares for each of the Australian company's shares, has opened its books to Newmont for due diligence but has not given its recommendation to shareholders on the offer.""Importantly, board recommendation and (an) independent expert report still remain key hurdles,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Rahul Anand wrote in a report to clients on Wednesday.If the deal is successful it would be the third-largest deal ever involving an Australian company and the third-largest globally in 2023, according to data from Refinitiv and Reuters calculations.Barclays analysts said there were still 'several hurdles before a deal' which included receiving regulatory sign off and approval from Newcrest and Newmont investors.The gap between Newcrest's share price and the implied offer price converged overnight, when Newmont shares resumed trade from a long weekend by falling 2.3%. That brought down the implied offer price for Newcrest to A$29.99.Newcrest traded at A$29.83 in early afternoon trade on Wednesday.Macquarie analysts upgraded their Newcrest share price target by 18% to A$33 on the back of the sweetened Newmont offer.Newmont declared its new bid ""best and final"" unless a higher rival bid emerges, which means under Australian corporate law its current offer cannot be improved. No. 2 gold producer Barrick Gold Corp has already ruled out a counter bid.Story continuesIf the deal proceeds, Newmont also plans to list CHESS Depository Interests (CDIs) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) which would allow trading in the merged company.Jefferies said in a report Australian shareholders of Newcrest ""will view a holding in MergeCo as a positive outcome from the deal as it provides access to a larger, more diversified asset base.""Block Inc and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield have CDIs listed in Australia after taking over Afterpay and Westfield, respectively, but trading in the securities is low because of the relatively small pools of liquidity in Australia compared to those stocks in their home markets.

Shareholders and analysts alike say the transaction looks much more likely to move forward following the boosted bid.“It’s clear that this is an improvement,” said Simon Mawhinney, chief investment officer of Allan Gray Australia Pty Ltd., the second-biggest shareholder in Newcrest behind BlackRock Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Even though I feel the market, and possibly Newmont, underappreciates Newcrest’s assets, I don’t feel anywhere near aggrieved enough to try and scupper a transaction like this.”Read More: Newcrest’s No. 2 Shareholder ‘Positively Disposed’ to Newmont BidThe deal — the largest gold mining takeover ever, if completed — is key to Newmont’s efforts to extend its lead over other bullion mining rivals like Barrick Gold Corp. It would also increase Newmont’s exposure to copper, a key material in the clean energy transition, at a time when analysts are predicting major shortages of the wiring metal over the coming decade. Newcrest wants copper to make up more than 50% of revenue by the end of the decade, up from around a quarter now.“Together as the clear gold-mining leader, we would be well-positioned to generate strong, stable and lasting returns with best-in-class sustainability performance for decades to come,” Newmont Chief Executive Tom Palmer said in a statement.Story continuesThe Australian miner jumped on the news, closing 5.2% higher at A$29.74 in Sydney. Newmont shares dropped 0.4% to $50.87 as of 11:34 a.m. in New York on Tuesday.Newcrest hasn’t commented on the revised bid, though it confirmed it had opened its books for “confirmatory due diligence.” The deal still has several hurdles to cross, including securing a recommendation from Newcrest’s board. Due diligence is expected to take approximately four weeks. Newmont has indicated its offer is its “best and final.”Under the terms of the revised offer, Newcrest shareholders would receive 0.4 shares in the world’s largest gold miner for each one held. The deal also allows Newcrest to pay a special dividend of up to $1.10 per share. That adds up to a combined implied value of A$32.87 per share, representing a more than 46% premium to Newcrest’s price before the original February bid.DividendThe dividend component of the proposal takes advantage of an Australian tax law that grants domestic shareholders in local companies tax credits, but would not be available following the acquisition by the US company. These credits — based on the principal that corporation tax and personal income tax are interchangeable — can be “incredibly attractive to Australian-domiciled shareholders,” Mawhinney said, adding it was a key reason he liked the offer.Analysts read the boosted offer as a promising sign. “We believe this offer will be sufficient to progress the transaction,” said Jefferies analysts led by Christopher LaFemina. Morgans Financial analyst Sharad Bhat described the offer as a “reasonable” price, while BMO Capital Markets analyst Jackie Przybylowski wrote that “the transaction now looks much more likely to be completed.”Dealmaking activity in the mining sector has ramped up in recent months, after two years of rising commodity prices left many mining companies awash with cash but still short of future production. Last week, Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd. rejected a takeover bid from Anglo-Swiss commodities giant Glencore Plc for $23 billion. Glencore has since stepped up its pursuit of Teck with a new takeover proposal.Newmont’s offer follows other large gold deals including the $5.2 billion takeover of Yamana Gold Inc. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd.’s $10.4 billion takeover of Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. a year ago.Newcrest is being advised by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Gresham Advisory Partners Ltd.

But in Upper Egypt, it was a source of pride for families always to make their own.""It used to be shameful for families in villages to go and buy bread from a bakery. It would mean the house had grown lazy and complacent,"" Abdel Aal said.But with the cost of grain rising 70 percent in a year, he added that ""everyone is lining up outside bakeries"" run by the government.At least they can get subsidised bread there -- even if it tastes nothing like what they would make at home.bam/sbh/bha/srm/smw]"

Prices rose about 2% on Tuesday.The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.1% last month after advancing 0.4% in February, the Labor Department said. In the 12 months to March 31 the CPI increased 5%, the smallest year-on-year gain since May 2021.""The weaker U.S. CPI print has raised doubts over whether the Fed will now hike rates at all next month,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at brokerage StoneX. ""Falling interest-rate expectations is reducing recession concerns and helping to support buck-denominated asset prices at the same time.""U.S. President Joe Biden's top economic adviser and ex-Federal Reserve vice chair, Lael Brainard, also said she was seeing inflation coming down.The dollar dropped sharply after the data. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-priced oil cheaper for buyers holding other currencies.Hedge fund were buying oil futures in the market over the past few days in anticipation of improving demand, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.Markets shrugged off a small build in U.S. crude oil stocks, attributing it in part to a congressionally mandated release of oil from the U.S. emergency reserve and lower exports at the start of the month.Crude inventories rose by 597,000 barrels in the last week to 470.5 million, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 600,000-barrel drop. Gasoline and distillate stocks drew less-than-expected.Story continuesA report from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed crude inventories rose by about 380,000 barrels in the last week, while gasoline inventories were also higher, according to sources.Meanwhile, the global oil market could see tightness in the second half of 2023, which would push oil prices higher, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.The top U.S. shale basin has not seen peak production, Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said, while Pioneer Natural Resources chief executive Scott Sheffield said Wednesday that if oil prices break above $90 per barrel, then prices will likely reach $100 per barrel this year.In a negative for oil demand, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday trimmed its 2023 global growth outlook, citing the impact of higher interest rates.The market is also waiting for clarity on oil demand and supply, with monthly reports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the International Energy Agency due on Thursday and Friday, respectively.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Additional reporting by Muyu Xu and Ahmad Ghaddar; Editing by Kirsten Donovan, Matthew Lewis, Leslie Adler and Daniel Wallis)]"

That spells trouble for OPEC nations, which recently announced an unexpected 1 million barrel a day production cut to buoy oil prices and ensure stability in energy markets.The cartel's production cuts still have a significant impact on global energy markets, with crude prices jumping 8% after the cuts were initially announced.""The question is, who's going to win out? Is it going to be the princes, or Powell in terms of the market?"" Croft said, referring to Saudi Arabia, the founding member and top oil producer of OPEC.Tensions between OPEC and the US have been rising since the cartel slashed production by 2 million barrels a day in mid-2022, snubbing President Biden's plea to keep oil prices stable as US inflation continued to soar. Supply cuts were necessary to control ""dysfunction"" in the energy market, Saudi Arabia previously said, claiming that oil prices were disconnected from fundamentals.Croft speculated OPEC would continue to ""stay active"" in controlling energy markets, and could slash production again later this year. She predicted oil prices could rise in the second half of the year, particularly if global oil demand ramps up due to China's reopening and markets heading into colder seasons.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The work related to this deal will be carried out in Syracuse, NY.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The rise in security threats and the changing dynamics of the defense world have led to increased defense spending by nations on weapons and arms, highlighting the fortified demand for defense products for defense companies. In this context, amplified spending on military submarines and related parts has also been witnessed to advance high-end tactical undersea warfare capabilities.The U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget proposal highlights $48.1 billion worth of investments for sea power. These include the construction of warships and submarines. Consequently, this should benefit LMT as the company designs, develops and integrates submarine combat systems for the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Spain and others.Going forward, per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the global submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% over the 2022-2031 period.Such probable growth prospects exemplify immense opportunities for companies like Lockheed Martin to win multiple contracts involving submarines and related parts, like the latest one. This should bolster the revenue generation prospects of the company from the submarine line of business.Peer ProspectsApart from Lockheed Martin, defense companies that are likely to reap the benefits of additional spending on submarines and a probable inflow of orders are as follows:General Dynamics’ GD Marine Systems segment is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines.

Don't Ignore These 2 Consumer Discretionary Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001455.html,1681218001,STORY,"['WYNN', 'MGM']","[Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. MGM Resorts (MGM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.06 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 1, 2023.MGM Resorts' Earnings ESP sits at 4300%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.06 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.MGM is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Wynn Resorts (WYNN) as well.Wynn Resorts, which is readying to report earnings on May 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.12 a share, and WYNN is 28 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesFor Wynn Resorts, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.27 is 145.2%.MGM and WYNN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

However, asking yourself why you must get involved in this space is important before delving deeper. This is likely because, in 2022, renewable energy sources surpassed coal as the primary source of electricity production in the United States for the first time in over 60 years.Renewable energy is gaining momentum globally, not just in the U.S. The growth of clean energy is unstoppable, with little to hold it back. As per the International Energy Agency, renewable power will become the world’s primary source of electricity generation by 2025.Wind and solar power will be huge in this transformation, contributing almost 20% of global power generation by 2027.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn addition, the European Union is pivotal in the shift towards renewable energy, as it aims to eliminate its dependency on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. It is a huge market. Consequently, the region will become a major driver toward a greener future.Battery-powered electric vehicles are also gaining traction alongside the increasing popularity of electricity generation and storage. Moreover, there is potential for a notable market for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles moving forward.Overall, renewable energy is an exciting sector for investors to explore as it expands. This article highlights three renewable energy stocks that are great plays in the clean energy space.Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy: NextEra Energy (NEE)The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is one of the world’s largest renewable energy companies, with a regulated utility division primarily dedicated to generating, transmitting, distributing, and selling electric energy in Florida.In addition to its regulated utility division, NextEra Energy also operates a segment that produces clean and renewable sources of electricity. The company is also involved in battery storage and green hydrogen. Given the scale of its operations, NEE is frequently included on various lists of renewable energy stocks to consider.Story continuesHydrogen plays a vital role in the transition towards renewable energy by reducing carbon emissions in industrial areas. NextEra Energy has made substantial investments in hydrogen applications. NextEra Energy operates two distinct businesses. Its regulated electric utility operations, consisting largely of Florida Power &amp; Light, is a large and growing utility in the United States, benefiting from population growth and providing a strong foundation for the company.On top of this solid core is NextEra Energy Resources. It is a less descriptive but exciting name for the company’s non-utility renewable energy business. This segment produces electricity from clean and renewable sources such as wind and solar and engages in battery storage and green hydrogen. Consequently, combining these two businesses has allowed NextEra Energy to establish itself as the world’s largest renewable energy company.NextEra Energy expects to maintain its growth trajectory, with adjusted earnings projected to grow between 6% and 8% annually through 2026. In addition, it is expecting a 10% dividend growth until at least 2024. Despite being in a traditionally slow-moving industry, the company’s promising outlook has attracted investors, resulting in a premium price for its stock.First Solar (FSLR)First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is a solar cell manufacturer specializing in designing, producing, installing, and maintaining cadmium telluride photovoltaic modules. These modules are known for their high efficiency in converting sunlight into electricity. It is one of the top solar stocks out there.Through its focus on efficient module design and cost-reduction strategies, First Solar is quickly becoming one of the most successful companies within the renewable energy industry.As a sector veteran, First Solar is a strong, consistent performer. Its latest financial results, announced on Feb. 28, reaffirm why the solar company is a premier player.First Solar reported net sales of slightly over $1 billion for the quarter, a 10% increase from the previous year. The net loss narrowed significantly to over $7.5 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to the previous year’s loss of over $49 million.This exceeded analysts’ expectations, with the average estimate for a net loss of $0.17 per share. Revenue was in line with expectations at $1 billion.First Solar is providing robust guidance to support its positive outlook. The company is projecting net sales of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for 2023, representing a growth rate of at least 30% from the previous year. Earnings per share are forecasted at $7 to $8, a significant improvement over 2022’s net loss of $0.41.These projections exceed aggregate analyst estimates of $3.34 billion for net sales and just $4.77 per-share net income.Due to the positive performance, First Solar stock is on cloud nine. Shares are up more than 158% over the last year, making it one of the top-performing renewable energy stocks you can buy. Load up on this name whenever there are dips.Brookfield Renewable Corp. (BEPC)A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockBrookfield Renewable Corp. (NYSE:BEPC) is among the largest constituents of sustainable energy. It manages eco-friendly energy systems comprising various hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage establishments across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.Furthermore, the corporation’s broad business assortment incorporates eco-friendly energy and transformation, infrastructure, private investment, property, and financial and insurance services.Its portfolio is continuously growing, with over 120 gigawatts in the pipeline.Brookfield Renewable and its partners have announced their intention to acquire Origin Energy, with Brookfield investing $750 million. The acquisition entails Brookfield, its institutional partners GIC and Temasek, acquiring Origin Energy’s energy markets business. In contrast, MidOcean Energy, a liquefied natural gas firm established by GIC, will acquire Origin Energy’s integrated gas business.The acquisition provides Brookfield Renewable with an excellent opportunity to spearhead a massive decarbonization initiative in Australia. The company plans to invest billions of dollars in constructing additional renewable energy generation and storage facilities, decommission Origin’s coal-fired power plant, and reduce emissions, creating a consistent source of cash flow.By acquiring Origin Energy, Brookfield is making a strategic investment that allows it to increase its renewable energy capacity substantially.The investment should pay dividends for shareholders and the planet, potentially driving faster growth and producing powerful total returns. It will also allow Brookfield to become a leader in the decarbonization movement. Savvy investors know that ESG is attracting substantial investor interest. So, it is a win-win for Brookfield.To summarize, Brookfield Renewable is a top pick for investors seeking renewable energy stocks to buy.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) so let's look a bit deeper.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Patterson Companies is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$253m ÷ (US$2.9b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Thus, Patterson Companies has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 9.4% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Patterson Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Patterson Companies Tell Us?We're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Patterson Companies. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 34% over the trailing five years. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 31% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. Patterson Companies may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In the end, Patterson Companies has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. Since the stock has only returned 39% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.If you'd like to know more about Patterson Companies, we've spotted   3 warning signs,  and 2 of them are concerning.While Patterson Companies may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because The Bank of New York Mellon is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.12 per share for BK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.58% heading into earnings season.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that BK has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for The Bank of New York Mellon, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

181,4e890330-5842-3741-b8fa-d719fb8e38c7,BK,2023-04-12,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-140002149.html,1681221602,STORY,['BK'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.35 billion, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.13% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation?For The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +6.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.40 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +29.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $35.37 billion, up 15.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has been revised 0.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.77%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

183,80c6991e-120c-30b6-a23a-89894265ec01,TSN,2023-04-12,Booking and Tyson Foods have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/booking-tyson-foods-highlighted-zacks-124712810.html,1681217232,STORY,"['TSN', 'LNG', 'BKNG', 'SBOW', 'CRK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 11, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Booking BKNG as the Bull of the Day and Tyson Foods Inc. TSN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on SilverBow Resources SBOW, Cheniere Energy LNG and Comstock Resources CRK.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Booking, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, is one of the largest online travel companies in the world and is the dominant player in the online travel space. The Connecticut-based company provides clients a one-stop shop for all their travel needs. Its broad and diverse travel-related offerings include hotel room bookings, airline tickets, rental cars, vacation packages, cruises, ""things to do"" at customer destinations, and travel insurance. Though Booking Holdings is the name behind the umbrella company, it has many different brands in its portfolio, including Kayak, Priceline, OpenTable, and Rentalcars.com, to name a few.An International Growth StoryUnsurprisingly for the international travel booking juggernaut, earnings came to a screeching halt during the COVID-19 pandemic months. However, BKNG's earnings have clawed back to pre-pandemic levels and are expected to begin exceeding those levels this year.What's driving the growth? BKNG is enjoying earning's growth spurred on by secular growth factors such as the transition from standard booking procedures of the past to online booking. Because much of BKNG's business is derived internationally, the secular tailwind should last for years. While much of the U.S. has already adopted online booking, the international market is still in the process of doing so. Furthermore, the European online travel market which BKNG also serves is currently growing faster than the domestic one. That said, BKNG management has made moves to increase domestic revenue by acquiring OpenTable and other U.S.-focused businesses.Story continuesLook Beyond the ""Sticker Shock""Though BKNG currently trades at around $2500 a share, investors should override any feelings of ""sticker shock"" they may have for three reasons:Reasonable valuation: BKNG's forward P/E ratio of 19 is basically inline with the S&amp;P 500 Index's forward P/E of 18. The company's valuation is also attractive when compared to competitors such as Airbnb, which has a forward P/E of 32.You get what you pay for: Like with most things in life; you get what you pay for. The stock market is no different. Institutional investors tend to be attracted to higher priced stocks because they perceive them to be more stable and less risky, higher quality companies, and tend to be issued by companies with long track records of success.Stock split potential: Management can unlock an immense amount of shareholder value through a stock split. While many institutions don't mind paying high stock prices, retail investors do. If management decided to implement a stock split, BKNG would attract a wider range of investors. While there are no plans to conduct a split at the moment, a future split would be a potential catalyst for the stock.Liquidity + Earnings Growth: The Magic ElixirGrowing as a small company and growing as a large company are two completely different ball games. As a company grows into the multi-billions, scaling growth is much more difficult. Large investors are often attracted to mega-cap, liquid stocks with high earnings growth. The reason being is that for a large pension fund or mutual fund to take on a meaningful position, liquidity is a requirement that is non-negotiable. Otherwise, the fund will move the market too much and has a difficult time exiting the stock should that be necessary. At the same time, institutions do not want stagnant growth. Being both liquid and high growth is hard to achieve, but BKNG is one company that has pulled it off. The $97 billion company grew top-line growth at a healthy 56% and 41% over the past two quarters.Technical PictureThe first factor that stands out is BKNG's relative strength. From a price and volume perspective, BKNG's performance is encouraging. Over the past six months, shares of competitors such as Airbnband Expediaare flat, while BKNG gained 54.6%.Secondly, the stock has trended well and has continuously found support at its rising 50-day moving average – a sign of a strong trend.As long as shares hold the 50-day moving average zone, investors can feel assured that the uptrend remains intact.Bottom Line  Investors should expect BKNG to outperform over the next 6-12 months. The online travel giant differentiates itself through its diverse businesses, international foothold, and rare liquidity and earnings growth mix. BKNG's strong brand name gives the company a clear advantage over its small competitors. Furthermore, since the company offers such a wide variety of services through its ecosystem, customers often end up using the website for a multitude of services, rather than just one.Bear of the Day:Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Tyson Foods Inc. is the largest chicken company in the United States. Beyond chicken, the company also produces, distributes, and markets beef, pork, and an assortment of prepared foods under the Jimmy Dean name and other brands.Earnings Need to Beef Up  From a size perspective, Tyson is the market-leading meats producer in the United States by far and has a hold on roughly 20% of the market share. However, this fact is already priced into shares. Is there room for much growth from here? Tyson's dismal forward estimates suggest not much. This year, top-line growth is expected to slog along at a 2.8% growth rate, while bottom-line growth is expected to plunge 52.5%.Meanwhile, last quarter, earnings growth was an abysmal -70% year-over-year. The company's lagging beef segment is one factor dragging down Tyson's growth. In Q1, Tyson's beef segment declined from $5,002 million to $4,723 million. The slowdown is not isolated to Tyson – the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects fiscal 2023 domestic production to fall roughly 5% in the segment.Inefficiency One way for a slower-growing company (like Tyson) to thrive is to have high margins. Unfortunately, in the case of Tyson, gross margins are moving in the wrong direction. Higher competition, industry headwinds, and international currency movements are squeezing the meat producer. TSN's gross margins are now at their lowest levels since 2016. The picture gets uglier When you compare TSN's 10.49% gross margin to that of the S&amp;P 500 (48.73).Lagging Price and Volume ActionEven ahead of fundamentals, the best arbiter of truth in the stock market is the price and volume action – it doesn't lie. Like Tyson's fundamental picture, its technical picture is dull. For example, S&amp;P 500 has shot higher by 56.7% over the past five years while Tyson is down 15.7%.Zoom in a bit more, and the picture doesn't get much prettier. The stock is clearly in a downtrend and is approaching the underside of the 50-day moving average – a zone where the stock failed the past four visits.Weak IndustryOutside of the general market and earnings estimates, the single most significant factor impacting the price of a stock is the industry group it is in. The Food–Meat Products group is in the bottom 9% of all industry groups tracked by Zacks. Industry group peers such as Hormel Foodsand Pilgrim's Pridealso show poor earnings growth and weak technical action.Bottom Line   Meat producers like Tyson Foods are facing several challenges that could lead to further declines in stock prices. Furthermore, Tyson's fundamental picture is one of slowing growth and shrinking margins – a lethal combo. Lastly, the poor price and volume action confirms the fundamental picture laid out above.Additional content:Natural Gas Prices Extend Losses for Yet Another WeekThe U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. The negative inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures fell week over week. In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020.While macro challenges are leading to some concerns, we advise investors to focus on stocks like SilverBow Resources and Cheniere Energy.EIA Reports a Withdrawal Marginally Smaller Than AnticipatedStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 23 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Mar 31, just below the guidance of 24 Bcf decline per a survey conducted by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.While the decrease compared favorably with the five-year (2018-2022) average net change of 0 Bcf, it came slightly below last year's shrinkage of 24 Bcf.The latest draw of the winter heating season puts total natural gas stocks at 1,830 Bcf, which is 443 Bcf (31.9%) above the 2022 level at this time and 298 Bcf (19.5%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 105 Bcf per day, unchanged on a weekly basis as lower dry production was offset by an increase in shipments from Canada.Meanwhile, daily consumption deteriorated 4.8% to 99.7 Bcf from 104.7 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting lower industrial as well as residential/commercial demand.Price Action Remains BearishNatural gas prices trended downward last week — a holiday-shortened one — following the smaller-than-expected inventory draw. Futures for May delivery ended Thursday at $2.01 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 9.3% from the previous week's closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is also indicative of mild spring weather in the days ahead, which would translate into bigger inventory additions due to tepid requirements for heating and coolingAs is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With the latest models anticipating little temperature-driven consumption in the near term (with less use of heaters/coolers across homes and businesses), prices are likely to be impacted adversely. Compounding the matter, daily production has hovered around the record 100 Bcf mark due to a relatively mild winter, and this has pushed stocks significantly above historical levels.However, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is also supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere.Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict dragging on, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, last year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means that LNG deliveries are poised to remain robust, especially with squeezed natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe, following a shutdown in the Nord Stream pipeline from last August.Finally, the return of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas to full capacity will lead to more gas flowing overseas. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by a blast in June last year and was only partially functional till recently.Final ThoughtsBased on several factors, the natural gas market is down more than 55% so far this year. As a matter of fact, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather. As such, investors are rather unsure of what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for holding on to fundamentally strong stocks like SilverBow Resources and Cheniere Energy.SilverBow Resources: SilverBow has operations across roughly 130,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, and more than 80% of its total output comprises natural gas. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's exposure to premium markets and focus on costs and margins should help it to benefit from any increase in natural gas prices.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.SilverBow beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 80.8%. Valued at around $528 million, SBOW has lost 36.3% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 187.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked natural gas exporter's 2023 earnings has been revised 8.7% upward over the past 60 days. LNG shares have gained 10% in a year.At the same time, investors might want to sell some bottom-ranked stocks like Comstock Resources. Comstock Resources: CRK is a leading operator in the Haynesville shale — a premier natural gas basin — with 323,000 net acres. About 98% of the company's total output is natural gas.Comstock Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of -50.1% for the current year. Valued at around $2.9 billion, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company's 2023 earnings have been revised 37.8% downward over the past 60 days. CRK shares have lost 30.8% this year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

She said the strike may continue on Tuesday and Wednesday.Tyson told Reuters later on Monday it already had a policy in place to give full payouts to employees with unused vacation or holiday time. The company said it will also pay a bonus of $1,000 to workers who stay in their jobs until the plant closes.Some employees quit after Tyson announced the plant would close, leaving more work for fewer employees, Licolli said.

That spells trouble for OPEC nations, which recently announced an unexpected 1 million barrel a day production cut to buoy oil prices and ensure stability in energy markets.The cartel's production cuts still have a significant impact on global energy markets, with crude prices jumping 8% after the cuts were initially announced.""The question is, who's going to win out?

As currently structured, these models primarily run in power-hungry, network-dependent data centers. Running AI on edge devices such as smartphones and PCs would improve reliability, latency, privacy, network bandwidth usage, and overall cost.To move AI workloads to devices, we need to make neural networks considerably more efficient. Qualcomm has been investing heavily in the tools to do so, most recently showcasing the world's first Stable Diffusion model on an Android phone. Bringing models like GPT, with its hundreds of billions of parameters, to devices will require even more work.The Qualcomm AI Research team has been making advances in deep learning model efficiency for the past years with state-of-the-art results in neural architecture search, compilation, conditional compute, and quantization. Quantization, which reduces the number of bits needed to represent information, is particularly important because it allows for the largest effective reduction of the weights and activations to improve power efficiency and performance while maintaining accuracy. It also helps enable use cases that run multiple AI models concurrently, which is relevant for industries such as mobile, XR, automotive, and more.Recently, a new 8-bit floating-point format (FP8) has been suggested for efficient deep-learning network training. As some layers in neural networks can be trained in FP8 as opposed to the incumbent FP16 and FP32 networks, this format would improve efficiency for training tremendously. However, the integer formats such as INT4 and INT8 have traditionally been used for inference, producing an optimal trade-off between network accuracy and efficiency.We investigate the differences between the FP8 and INT8 formats for efficient inference and conclude that the integer format is superior from a cost and performance perspective. We have also open sourced the code for our investigation for transparencyStory continuesDifferences between floating point and integer quantizationOur whitepaper compares the efficiency of floating point and integer quantization. For training, the floating-point formats FP16 and FP32 are commonly used as they have high enough accuracy, and no hyper-parameters. They mostly work out of the box, making them easy to use.Going down in the number of bits improves the efficiency of networks greatly, but the ease-of-use advantage disappears. For formats like INT8 and FP8, you have to set hyper-parameters for the representable range of the distributions. To get your original network accuracy back, you also have to spend some extra time quantizing these networks. Either in some simple quantization steps called post-training-quantitation (PTQ), or by training the network in a quantized way all together, called quantization-aware-training (QAT).Given that most training in the industry is currently conducted with entire networks in FP32, or sometimes FP16 with mixed precision, the step to having some parts of a network run in FP8 is an appealing potential speed-up for the costly and time-intensive training procedures in deep learning. This topic has gained quite some traction lately, so we set out to find out what this development means for efficient inference on edge devices. Specifically, we look at both the hardware considerations for the formats and the effect of the chosen formats on neural network accuracy.Our whitepaper shows that the hardware implementation of the FP8 format is somewhere between 50% to 180% less efficient than INT8 in terms of chip area and energy usage. This is because of the additional logic needed in the accumulation of FP formats versus integer formats. This seems like a broad range, but the actual efficiency depends on many hardware design choices that vary greatly. A similar conclusion was reached recently by Microsoft and Meta: Floating-point arithmetic is just much less efficient than integer arithmetic.This means that FP8 will have to be significantly more accurate than INT8 to be worthwhile from a hardware-efficiency perspective.Quantization-aware training (QAT) resultsQuantization-aware training is the quantization scenario most like how a format like FP8 would be used in practice, you train with the format while optimizing your neural network. We show the QAT results below for different tested formats. We see that all quantized networks get close to their original floating-point performance. In most cases, we even see an improvement over the baseline results of FP32. The reason for this is simply that training these models for longer generally improves results, even if we would train longer in FP32.The results are quite clear: INT8 tends to perform better than other formats for most types of networks. It is only for transformers that FP8 performs better, but in the paper, we delve deeper into transformers and show that this difference is easily mitigated. The conclusion is simple however: there is no a-priori reason to believe that the FP8 format is more accurate for neural networks. In some cases, even when going as low as 4-bit weights with the W4A8 format (as indicated in the rightmost column of Figure 2), the accuracy is comparable to the FP8 format.Can we convert FP8 to INT8 with good accuracy?Since there are some benefits to using the FP8 data format for training, we also investigated the performance when FP8-E4 (a FP8 format with 4 exponent bits) trained networks are converted naively to INT8 for inference. We found that INT8 can precisely represent roughly 90% of the range covered by the FP8-E4 format without any quantization error. The remaining 10% of the range close to 0 incurs a small quantization error.The general conclusion is that for networks that were originally easy to quantize from FP32 to INT8, the conversion is expected to be smooth, and can in several cases be done directly.For networks that were already problematic to convert to INT8 from FP32 with simple PTQ techniques, mostly networks with significant outliers, similar issues will arise when converting from FP8 to INT8. However, since these latter networks are trained to deal with the reduced precision of the FP8 format, the INT8 conversion results from FP8 are better when compared against INT8 simple conversion from FP32. Moreover, INT8 QAT can be further employed to recover more accuracy in such cases.The path towards better AI inference on deviceOverall, integer quantization is still the way to do efficient AI inference. With varying effort levels, you can achieve significant efficiency benefits without sacrificing much accuracy.For optimizing networks even further, opting for QAT can get the networks into the W4A8 (4-bit weight and 8-bit activation) regime. This is very achievable for a wide range of networks. Transformer-based large language models such as GPT, Bloom and Llama tend to benefit greatly from this jump in efficiency from 8- to 4-bit, as they are weight-bounded. Several works have shown that 4-bit weights are not only possible for large language models, but this is also optimal and possible to do in the PTQ setting. This is an efficiency boost that currently does not exist in the floating-point world.To sum it all up, we see that floating-point format FP8-E4 is not a replacement for INT8 in terms of performance and accuracy. In most cases, they perform worse. Only in some extremely specific scenarios where layers have significant outliers, can the floating-point format perform better in terms of accuracy. We are confident that our proposed solutions will lead to a better and more seamless implementation of large AI models on edge devices. For this purpose, the Qualcomm Innovation Center has open-sourced the AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET). This allows developers to quantize their models more easily and implement AI on device more efficiently.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/748643/Floating-Point-Arithmetic-for-AI-Inference--Hit-or-Miss]"

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.7bUS$13.5bUS$12.7bUS$13.0bUS$13.5bUS$13.6bUS$13.7bUS$13.9bUS$14.2bUS$14.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.76%Est @ 1.15%Est @ 1.43%Est @ 1.62%Est @ 1.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$10.6kUS$11.1kUS$9.5kUS$8.9kUS$8.4kUS$7.6kUS$7.0kUS$6.5kUS$6.0kUS$5.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$81bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$185bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$185b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$71bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$152b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$124, the company appears about fair value at a 8.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at QUALCOMM as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.341. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for QUALCOMMStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.1% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.19%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had gained 6.78% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.7% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.13% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Qualcomm as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be May 3, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.15, down 33.02% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.06 billion, down 18.82% from the prior-year quarter.QCOM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.34 per share and revenue of $37.99 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -25.46% and -14.05%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Qualcomm is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Qualcomm's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 13.18. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 13.18, which means Qualcomm is trading at a no noticeable deviation to the group.Story continuesMeanwhile, QCOM's PEG ratio is currently 0.84. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. QCOM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.52 as of yesterday's close.The Wireless Equipment industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 71, putting it in the top 29% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Qualcomm (QCOM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.87, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.87 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.9% and 5.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Qualcomm, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in QCOM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $9.34.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Qualcomm.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.This increased demand results in a solid contract flow from Pentagon and other U.S. allies for production and associated support to modernize and upgrade the F-35 jets. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Impressively, the F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022. Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in the backlog till December 2022.Looking ahead, the company expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster LMT’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031.

208,566fb036-4963-3fe0-a7f6-ff904ea65484,LMT,2023-04-12,Earnings Preview: Lockheed Martin (LMT) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-lockheed-martin-lmt-140002298.html,1681221602,STORY,['LMT'],"[The market expects Lockheed Martin (LMT) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.8%.Revenues are expected to be $14.95 billion, down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.83% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?For Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.18%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lockheed will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $7.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.79, delivering a surprise of +5.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Lockheed doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BAX recently announced the U.S. launch of ZOSYN (piperacillin and tazobactam) Injection. Zosyn premix, indicated for treating multiple infections caused by susceptible bacteria, is available in Baxter’s proprietary single-dose Galaxy containers (a non-PVC and non-DEHP system that enables premixed medications to have a longer shelf life).Baxter will be selling Zosyn premix in 2.25 g in 50 mL, 3.375 g in 50 mL and 4.5 g in 100 mL presentations.The latest launch is expected to significantly boost Baxter’s portfolio of anti-infective medications under the Pharmaceuticals, solidifying its foothold in the niche space across the nation.Significance of the LaunchThe use of premixes (ready-to-use formats of standard doses of commonly prescribed drugs) is expected to offer operational efficiencies for healthcare providers. Compounding a drug for patient use is a multi-step, manual process that requires oversight by pharmacy staff.A ready-to-use product like Zosyn premix can simplify the preparation process and aid in improving patient safety by reducing the chances of contamination and avoiding potential dosing errors that may occur when medications are compounded.Per management, the provision of an additional frozen premix option will likely aid in supporting patient safety and offer added convenience for healthcare providers.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Data Bridge Market Research, the global market for anti-infective drugs was estimated to be $135 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $184.7 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 4%. Factors like increasing awareness about infectious diseases and growing demand for oral drugs are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is likely to provide a significant boost to Baxter’s business on a national scale.Notable DevelopmentsIn February, Baxter announced its fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein it registered a robust uptick in year-over-year revenues on a reported, constant currency and operational basis (excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hill-Rom). The company also registered solid growth in its U.S. sales on a reported basis.

215,31f16443-c6f5-3aa0-b9d7-22f6808783cd,BAX,2023-04-12,"Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) shareholders are up 5.8% this past week, but still in the red over the last three years",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-international-nyse-bax-shareholders-132833837.html,1681133313,STORY,['BAX'],"[Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 11% in the last month. But that cannot eclipse the less-than-impressive returns over the last three years. Truth be told the share price declined 51% in three years and that return, Dear Reader, falls short of what you could have got from passive investing with an index fund.While the stock has risen 5.8% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us. Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the three years that the share price declined, Baxter International's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Extraordinary items contributed to this situation. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Baxter International's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Baxter International, it has a TSR of -48% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 9.2% in the twelve months, Baxter International shareholders did even worse, losing 45% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

216,146ed6c7-8073-324b-b302-937ebc735314,WEC,2023-04-12,The Returns At WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) Aren't Growing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-wec-energy-group-nyse-125605049.html,1681131365,STORY,['WEC'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for WEC Energy Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.054 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$42b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, WEC Energy Group has an ROCE of 5.4%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 5.0%, it's still a low return by itself. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for WEC Energy Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for WEC Energy Group.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of WEC Energy Group's historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. The company has consistently earned 5.4% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 34% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.The Bottom LineAs we've seen above, WEC Energy Group's returns on capital haven't increased but it is reinvesting in the business. Since the stock has gained an impressive 83% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for WEC Energy Group   (of which 1 is concerning!) that you should know about.While WEC Energy Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

""Where are these claimants coming from and who are these claimants?""Kaplan said he shared Richenderfer's concerns, but would not take any action to stop LTL's second bankruptcy filing until he gets more information.J&amp;J faces more than 38,000 lawsuits that have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey alleging that its talc products sometimes contained carcinogenic asbestos, and those cases have been on hold while LTL pursues a bankruptcy settlement. J&amp;J has said its baby powder and other talc products are safe, do not cause cancer or contain asbestos.In 2021, J&amp;J divided its consumer business in two and offloaded the talc lawsuits onto a newly created subsidiary that almost immediately filed for Chapter 11, a tactic that could halt the lawsuits and force plaintiffs into a global settlement in bankruptcy court.Story continuesLTL's first bankruptcy case was dismissed as improper after the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the company was not in ""financial distress.""LTL attorney Greg Gordon said at Tuesday's court hearing that the second bankruptcy is different because the company has fewer assets available and more support for a bankruptcy settlement.Lawyers for those who say use of J&amp;J's talc products caused cancer on Tuesday spoke for and against the settlement, a day after a faction of plaintiffs alleged that J&amp;J's settlement was ""fraudulently and collusively"" co-signed by plaintiffs' attorneys with ""exaggerated"" numbers of clients.Gordon called that an ""over the top accusation,"" saying plaintiffs' support for the settlement is real and substantial. Any doubts about it could quickly be put to rest by allowing them to vote on the settlement, he added.David Molton, who represented the official committee of talc claimants in LTL's first bankruptcy, said the second bankruptcy filing must be dismissed so that cancer victims can have their day in court.""Hundreds of victims of J&amp;J's products have died waiting for justice to be done,"" Molton said.Mikal Watts, who represents clients who support the deal, said that the settlement offers the first real chance for women with cancer to get a payout from J&amp;J. The women should have a chance to vote on the existing deal, Watts said.Gordon said LTL is ""still getting a handle on"" the total number of talc claims, but it believes it has support from two-thirds talc claimants.LTL's proposed settlement would address not only the cases that are pending in federal court, but also cases that have not yet been filed.It expects to file a formal bankruptcy plan by May 14.(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)]"

Gordon said in federal court on Tuesday. The company must get to 75% to have a chance at winning approval for the deal from US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan. The holdouts are working to block the company from reaching that goal, Gordon said.As the bankruptcy goes forward, LTL and J&amp;J will present evidence to “show an aggressive, concerted effort by the plaintiff firms on this committee to scuttle this agreement through threats and intimidation directed at LTL, J&amp;J” and plaintiffs who support the plan, Gordon said.Law Firms SplitThe $8.9 billion deal has split the many law firms who are representing tens of thousands of women who claim they got cancer from baby powder. Opponents claim J&amp;J wrongly put LTL back into bankruptcy just hours after its first effort was dismissed on orders from a federal appeals court.“For people suffering and dying of cancer, most of the time it’s not about money,” said Joseph D. Satterley, a lawyer opposed to the deal said in court. “Most of the time it’s about justice.”Story continuesA group of lawyers opposed to the deal claim that J&amp;J committed a fraudulent transfer by refining its legal tactics and putting LTL back in bankruptcy.In bankruptcy, a fraudulent transfer is typically a transaction in which a parent company takes something valuable away from a unit, leaving the subsidiary without enough money to pay its debts.In this case, critics claim that J&amp;J tried to make LTL qualify for a second bankruptcy by canceling an agreement that would have provided as much as $61 billion for LTL to settle the talc claims.J&amp;J rejected that legal theory. The company also denies that its baby powder contained asbestos or that the product caused cancer. The company has taken its talc-based baby powder off the market.Legal experts say J&amp;J’s latest strategy is risky because it relies on tweaking the details of the original LTL bankruptcy and immediately resubmitting the case.J&amp;J faces two major hurdles: it must survive any new legal challenge from opponents who argue the second case is just as flawed as the first, and it has to convince 75% of all victims to vote in favor of the deal.Earlier this year, an appeals court rejected J&amp;J’s first bid to use LTL’s Chapter 11 filing to settle the lawsuits because the unit was not in financial distress and therefore did qualify for court protection. Last week, that dismissal became official.J&amp;J argues this time is different because they have support from many more cancer victims. The company also replaced its original promise to financially support LTL with a much more limited pledge. That change means LTL is distressed and therefore can return to bankruptcy, the company argued in court papers.J&amp;J first put LTL into bankruptcy in 2021 and within months convinced Kaplan to halt all talc trials and order victims into court-supervised mediation.The new bankruptcy filing is LTL Management LLC, 23-12825, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (Trenton).--With assistance from Jef Feeley.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Runner’s Murder in Kenya Opens a Window Into Violence Against WomenThe Business of … DeathWhat to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New WorldThe Fight Over the Abortion Pill Is Just Getting StartedScaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital Was Spiraling, and Then Came FTX©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Covid Treatment Stocks to Buy Today. If there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the world. The deadly disease, which first surfaced in 2019 and rapidly spread all over the world in 2020 became one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is staggering as well, with data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggesting that as of March 16, 2023, 6.8 million people have lost their lives to the virus; a figure that pales in comparison to the 760 million confirmed cases of the virus.These staggering figures have an economic cost to them as well, which naturally cannot be compared to the loss of life. Still, if the number of infections and deaths did not stun you, perhaps the projected economic costs will. According to estimates from the International Monetary Fund -  a global body that aims to help distressed economies - the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic will cost the world a whopping $12.5 trillion by 2024. For reference, the global economy was estimated to sit at $96 trillion in 2021 according to estimates from the world bank, so if the IMF's forecast bears fruit, then the economic damage from the virus will have eaten out a significant chunk of global economic output.Still, the pandemic also saw an unprecedented global response where vaccines were flown around to all corners of the world to aid the battle against the coronavirus. The WHO also estimates that as of March 11, 2023, a stunning 13 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Using the World Bank's population estimates from 2021, which place the global population at 7.8 billion, almost two vaccine doses per person have been administered so far - an achievement that has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in containing the virus. The rapid vaccination has ensured that as the world entered 2023, the trend of coronavirus deaths and cases began to drop from earlier peaks that took place at different times in different places of the world.Story continuesAt the same time, the number of treatments and vaccines available in the fight against the virus has also significantly grown. While initially, particularly in the Western world, a handful of vaccines from Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were available, nowadays, a lot of new players have entered into the market.These companies are entering a market that grew from no value to one spanning billions of dollars in a short time period. A research report from the WHO estimates that $141 billion of vaccines were shipped globally in 2021, for an approximately 3.5x growth from 2021 - demonstrating the scale of the global response against the pandemic. At the same time, it indicates that vaccine manufacturing is still a highly specialized process, with ten manufacturers accounting for 70% of all the vaccines shipped. Zooming in on the coronavirus vaccine market itself, Transparency Market Research estimates that the segment was valued at $92.6 billion in 2021 and is expected to record a negative compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% between 2022 and 2031 to sit at an estimated $9.9 billion by the end of the forecast period. To cater to this dropping value, the research firm believes that the market participants will have to inform the general public about the benefits of herd immunization, as well as leverage their existing vaccine development experience to develop products for other diseases as well. At the same time, it also points out that the market can grow due to potential new variants of the virus that render older vaccines obsolete and require already vaccinated individuals to get additional doses. North America is estimated to be the most valuable vaccine market, with Europe coming in at second place.Pivoting from existing vaccine development experience to create new products is a trend that has already emerged in the market. The clearest example of this is Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), a company that few people had heard about prior to the pandemic and its Spikevax vaccine that was one of the most - if not the most - effective treatments to prevent severe viral infection. At its latest earnings call, the firm's president, Mr. Stephen Hoge shed some light on its diverse portfolio of fighting other respiratory infections, as he outlined:Lastly, our respiratory portfolio includes a large number of combination vaccines to provide protection against multiple respiratory pathogens which has advantages for many stakeholders, including healthcare providers, payers and consumers. These include combinations of COVID, flu and RSV as well as two pediatric vaccines that include additional viruses that are important in children, including hMPV and PIV3. As we prepare for endemic COVID in 2023 and beyond, we wanted to briefly recap the recent VRBPAC committee discussions and recommendations. At the January VRBPAC meeting, the committee voted to harmonize the primary series and booster dose vaccines, which is an important step to simplify future guidance. The FDA also indicated that it expects to convene VRBPAC to determine vaccine strain composition for the €˜23/24 season in the second quarter of this year.We believe that our mRNA platform has demonstrated its ability to deliver variant match vaccines on accelerated time horizons and we believe we are therefore well positioned to deliver whatever composition update the FDA and other public health agencies recommend. And moving to RSV, as you know, we shared the top line results from our Phase 3 RSV study in older adults earlier this year. And today, we shared additional data that was presented this morning at RSVVW. The top line results we have seen are incredibly encouraging and we are grateful to the FDA for breakthrough therapy designation for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need. In the top line data presented in January, the mRNA-1345 demonstrated 83.7% vaccine efficacy and the primary endpoint of lower respiratory tract disease with two or more symptoms.Today, we'll look at some covid treatment stocks, a list that also includes GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), and Novavax, Inc.

221,084a2cc0-c8a5-3f6b-9fd3-594150b0a882,JNJ,2023-04-12,Analysts Estimate Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-johnson-johnson-jnj-140002430.html,1681221602,STORY,['JNJ'],"[The market expects Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.4%.Revenues are expected to be $23.56 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.31% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson &amp; Johnson?For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson &amp; Johnson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Johnson &amp; Johnson would post earnings of $2.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.35, delivering a surprise of +5.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Ray Dalio's hedge fund, and go directly to read 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio. Ray Dalio is an American billionaire investor who founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975 in New York. He has a unique investment philosophy that is based on principles of radical transparency, meaningful work, and the importance of diversification. One of the core principles of Dalio's investment philosophy is the concept of ""risk parity."" This means that he believes that investors should allocate their portfolios based on the risks involved in each asset class, rather than on their historical returns. Through these strategies, Dalio built his firm into one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds. As of April 2023, the billionaire has a real-time net worth of $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.In October 2022, Dalio handed over control of Bridgewater Associates to a new generation of investors and turned his majority stake over to the board. This team of investment professionals is mainly responsible for choosing stocks and making investment decisions. Dalio will remain the chief investment officer mentor and will maintain his position on the firm’s operating board of directors. Following this development, Dalio tweeted:""Hopefully until I die, I will continue to be a mentor, an investor, and a board member at Bridgewater, because I and they love doing those things together.""Currently, Nir Bar Dea is serving as the chief executive officer of the firm. Under the new leadership, the hedge fund plans to expand its international footprint and develop artificial intelligence technologies. Earlier this year, the firm doubled its assets in China to over $2.93 billion, as reported by Reuters. Through this, Bridgewater becomes the biggest foreign hedge fund in the country. The firm launched its China fund in 2018 and delivered an annualized return of 15.6% through October 2022.Story continuesThroughout his career, Dalio focused on the current economic trends and talked about continuous interest rate hikes last year. He also recently spoke to Bloomberg about the wider implications of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. He said that this fallout would result in declining debt and credit markets. Here are some comments from the investors:“It is likely that this bank failure will be followed by many more problems before the contraction phase of the cycle runs its course. We are approaching the turning point.”Over the years, Bridgewater has delivered strong returns to shareholders. We previously reported that the firm’s flagship fund Pure Alpha II delivered an annual average return of 11.4% since its inception in 1991 through June 2022. The fund’s Pure Alpha also outperformed the market last year, gaining roughly 9.5%, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500.As of the close of Q4 2022, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of over $18.3 billion, compared with $19.7 billion in the previous quarter. A majority of the companies in the portfolio are dividend payers and have rewarded shareholders with regular dividends.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy.

Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.” Click to continue reading and see 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio.  Suggested articles:The 15 Best Selling Products Online10 Cheap REITs with Huge Upside12 Cheap Global Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

The company's robust surprise trend, which continued in fiscal Q2 2023, bodes well. Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter.The company's organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. Driven by the company's progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing commodity cost inflation, increases in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts that have hurt margins. Also, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023 due to persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)PepsiCo's shares have gained +9.3% over the past year against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry's gain of +11.2%.

The company's over-dependence on trading revenues for fee income is concerning. The volatile nature of the capital markets will adversely impact non-interest income performance.A tough operating backdrop will lead to increase in provisions, with we projecting a substantial jump in the metric this year. However, higher interest rates and decent loan demand are expected to keep aiding the company's net interest income (NII).Likewise, the company's net interest yield will continue expanding in the near-term. Also, opening of new financial centers, enhancement in digital capabilities and prudent cost management efforts are expected to keep aiding its financials.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Medtronic plc  and Blackstone Inc..Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

227,690b5d6e-a48b-34bd-8fdf-6450b971b007,RSG,2023-04-12,Slowing Rates Of Return At Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) Leave Little Room For Excitement,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slowing-rates-return-republic-services-111202788.html,1681211522.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Republic Services is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.097 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$29b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Republic Services has an ROCE of 9.7%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Commercial Services industry average of 8.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Republic Services roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Republic Services compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Republic Services.So How Is Republic Services' ROCE Trending?The returns on capital haven't changed much for Republic Services in recent years. The company has consistently earned 9.7% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 39% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.What We Can Learn From Republic Services' ROCEIn conclusion, Republic Services has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 124% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Republic Services  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

229,82a930f4-578a-3fba-91b5-fa8d031e7474,MRK,2023-04-12,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-mrk-trending-130001497.html,1681131601,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +4.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 9.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share, indicating a change of -33.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.60 indicates a change of +25.1% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.2%. The $58.51 billion and $62.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +6.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $13.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.62 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.65%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Seven were 787s, which Boeing had been blocked from shipping to airlines for several weeks while U.S. regulators looked into questions about pressure seals in the front of the planes.Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing has been forced to halt 787 deliveries several times in the last two years because of production and regulatory issues, and last week the Federal Aviation Administration proposed that airlines inspect their 787s for lavatory leaks that could let water seep into electronic equipment.The bulk of March deliveries — 52 of them — involved the smaller 737 Max jet, including 12 each to Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.Deliveries are an important source of cash for Boeing, which is trying to bounce back after losing more than $5 billion last year.Airbus reported 61 deliveries last month, bringing its total for the year to 127, almost all in its A320 family that competes with Boeing 737s.Boeing said it took new orders for 60 planes, but orders for 22 others were canceled, leading to a net gain of 38 in March. The largest chunk involved a previously disclosed order of 21 Max jets by Japan Airlines.Airbus took orders for 20 planes in March but two others were canceled.]"

Both winners are thrilled to further inspire and empower their students with the award.Hannah Nakamoto, Kearny High SchoolHannah is very grateful for the award because it will allow her to take a much-needed break this summer.""The award is significant for me because, I think it's about 50% of teachers quit after their first five years of teaching due to burnout,"" Hannah shares.Currently in her sixth year, she's noticed many colleagues leaving education or planning to leave due to burnout. She's struggled with it herself. She's worked an average of 3 to 6 weeks over the past 5 summers teaching summer school so she can make ends meet and pay her bills. Thanks to the award, she won't have to this summer.""I am really trying to find that balance between serving my students and taking care of myself,"" she continues. ""I myself am a resource, and if I burn out, that defeats the purpose of everything I want to do for my students.""As a young female minority STEM teacher of Japanese-Hawaiian and Mexican heritage, Hannah is no stranger to the struggles her underrepresented students are facing, and she's determined to continue to empower them on their journey.Growing up, she didn't have many people in her life encouraging her to pursue her interest in science. It wasn't until her community college teachers showed her that science was something attainable, something she could do, that she believed a STEM career was possible. Because of their encouragement, she went on to major in Chemistry at UCSD and earn her master's degree in education thereafter.""Before then, I saw science and STEM education as something I wasn't supposed to do because of the way I look,"" Hannah reflects. ""I'm non-white, I'm young, I'm short…I'm all the things you're not supposed to be in a position of power.""Story continuesShe hopes to lead by example to her students by showing them that if she can do it, so can they.""I look like the people I'm serving and that's why got into teaching STEM,"" Hannah says.In addition to better serving her students, Hannah is excited about building a stronger connection with Illumina through the award and bringing guest speakers to her classes to share about the many career paths available to them.""I'm excited to become familiar with the folks at Illumina and what they're doing because it aligns with what my students want to do in the future,"" she says.When she's not in the classroom, Hannah keeps busy dancing hula and running the salsa club and knitting club at Kearney.Mario Patiño, Preuss SchoolMario has always been passionate about science. The child of immigrants, he was the first one in his family to attend college. However, his passion for science and STEM education began long before then.""As a child, I always had an interest in science. My mother and the matriarchs of the family had a natural gift of practicing science from a cultural lens,"" shares Mario.""They inspired my passion for STEM early,"" he remembers. ""Doing science was not only part of daily chores or coursework in school, but it was also my source of entertainment. I used to make forts out of chaparral, chase rabbits in the canyon, and heal my wounds with medicinal plants. STEM has always fostered my creativity and curiosity to explore our world and beyond.""A 20-year science education veteran, Mario currently teaches sixth-grade university prep science, seventh-grade advanced science, and twelfth-grade AP Environmental Science. However, by no means does he consider himself an ‘expert.'""I have lived my entire career in the ‘learn-unlearn-relearn' cycle,"" Mario explains.Part of this learning cycle meant going where life took him and exploring a new career path in Hawaii as a biology technician at a federal agency. Before that, he ""was happy as a lab rat"" working as a research associate at biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies developing novel molecular and therapeutic products.The Hawaii role, however, is what sparked his passion for teaching.""That job led me to an opportunity to teach science at a famous Hawaiian private school,"" shares Mario.""I developed my passion for sharing my love of science by cultivating learning environments which were culturally centered, arts-focused, and inspired by innovative engineering and design.""Taking this passion into everything he does in the classroom today, Mario hopes to use the proceeds of the Illumina SD2 award to start the first Urban Agriculture Program at his school and stimulate STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and technology) learning through a biodiversity, sustainability, and food security lens.In his free time, he enjoys mountain biking, long beach walks/hikes, and playing the to'ere drum.About the awardThe Illumina Foundation SD2 STEM Educators Award aims to provide financial support for underrepresented educators currently teaching junior high or high school STEM classes in the San Diego County region. We are looking to support innovative educators who want to invest in their students and create a lasting impact.

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, and Henry Ford Health, a not-for-profit health care organization in the Detroit metro area, today announced the launch of a partnership to assess the impact of comprehensive genomic testing in cardiovascular disease. The first study under this new partnership, CardioSeq, launches today and will include 1500 patients receiving care from the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Henry Ford.Illumina today announced the launch of a partnership with Henry Ford Health, to assess the impact of comprehensive genomic testing in cardiovascular disease care. The first study under this new partnership, CardioSeq, launches today and will include 1500 patients at Henry Ford Health. Shown here, Dr. David Lanfear, vice president of clinical and translational research at Henry Ford and the study's lead clinician. Image credit: Ray Manning for Henry Ford HealthThe Lisa and Christopher Jeffries Center for Precision Medicine and the Center for Individualized and Genomic Medicine Research at Henry Ford Health will conduct a series of implementation and clinical studies that will investigate the use of next-generation sequencing tests, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to assess their impact on clinical care. The studies will focus on cardiovascular disease, an area that imposes a substantial clinical and economic burden on the health care ecosystem, with a particular interest in diverse and underserved populations.""This study is the first of several that will measure the impact of whole-genome sequencing in patients with cardiovascular disease,"" said Dr. David Lanfear, vice president of clinical and translational research at Henry Ford Health and the study's lead clinician. ""What we're initially most interested in is the rate of the change in medical management due to the genetic information, but eventually we will be looking at differences in cost and clinical outcomes as well.""Dr. Phil Febbo, chief medical officer of Illumina, added: ""We are honored to partner with Henry Ford Health to assess the potential benefits of integrating genomic testing within specialized care centers in the health care system. We share the belief that genomics should be integrated into standard of care across clinical indications as one of the key determinants of health. We intend for our partnership to demonstrate the benefits of such an approach for individual patients and the broader health care system, especially in underserved communities.""Story continuesCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, including in the United States, according to the World Health Organization. A patient's genetic make-up plays an important role in determining their risk of developing cardiovascular disease and how they respond to commonly prescribed medications. The CardioSeq study will use an accredited clinical test developed by Illumina that employs WGS to create a comprehensive cardiovascular genomic profile. Genomic profiling can provide clinicians and patients a more complete picture to base risk management and care planning decisions. This information could help facilitate early diagnosis and reduce unanticipated side effects, tests, and medical visits.The WGS test used in CardioSeq will screen each patient for more than 200 genetic causes of cardiovascular disease as well as the American College of Medical Geneticists and Genomics' recommended secondary findings genes, which are associated with known inherited conditions for which interventions are available to mitigate the onset or severity of the clinical outcome. The test also returns pharmacogenetic results, based on Food and Drug Administration and Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines, yielding valuable insights into how an individual will respond to a particular drug, based on their DNA.Genetic counselors will report any inherited disease findings to participating patients and offer them additional education. Pharmacists will review all pharmacogenetic findings and make indicated recommendations. The findings will also be shared with the patients' physicians. Henry Ford researchers aim to complete testing for all 1500 CardioSeq participants in 2024. With the patients' consent, their samples and clinical data will also be used by the partners for discovery efforts in genomic medicine to further the field of cardiovascular wellness and treatment.About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

(NASDAQ:ILMN)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-illumina-inc-120023097.html,1681128023,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Illumina’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Illumina Is Illumina Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 30%, trading at US$230 compared to my intrinsic value of $177.05. This means that the opportunity to buy Illumina at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Illumina’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Illumina look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. In Illumina's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 42%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ILMN’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ILMN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ILMN for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ILMN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Illumina from their most recent forecasts.

People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3%, and positive average annual dividend growth. Many stocks increase dividends over time, helping to offset the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Amgen (AMGN) is currently shelling out a dividend of $2.13 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.36%. This compares to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 9.79%. Check Amgen (AMGN) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) is paying out a dividend of $0.57 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.22% compared to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5.56% over the past year. Check Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.4 per share, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) has a dividend yield of 3.73%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.89% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 28.74%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

243,9b1c46d9-0221-387f-8666-fa981a90415b,SWKS,2023-04-12,7 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in April 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-semiconductor-stocks-buy-194701720.html,1680896821,STORY,"['NVDA', 'SWKS', 'INTC', 'MXL', 'MRVL', 'ON']","[Last year, investors may have noticed a massive flight of capital took place. Capital moved away from tech, as widespread concerns about rising interest rates caused fear. Semiconductors are integral to the tech sector, and suffer as a consequence. That said, some semiconductor stocks have rebounded, trending upward since late last year. This can be easily seen by looking at various ETFs, such as the iShares Semiconductor (NASDAQ:SOXX).Still, the semiconductor market remains well below its early 2022 levels, as measured by these indices. So, it’s reasonable to assume that investors could see continued returns in the near-term, as a rebound continues. The EV sector should continue contributing to the growth, and the emergence of AI poses further prospects.Ultimately, investors who play the long game will likely succeed in owning undervalued chip stocks, particularly as growth projections remain robust.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are the seven top undervalued semiconductor stocks on my watch list now.SWKSSkyworks Solutions$111.35MXLMaxLinear$33.69INTCIntel$32.81ONON Semiconductor$75.34AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$92.47NVDANvidia$270.37MRVLMarvell Technology$39.26Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) sells many products, including amplifiers, attenuators, diodes, modulators, isolators, optocouplers, and phase shifters, among other things. If you’re a relative outsider to the industry (like me), that doesn’t mean a lot. What’s important here is that Skyworks Solutions stock produces chips for the ubiquitous, always-on technology that dominates our society.Fortunately for investors, shares of SWKS stock are undervalued, based on Wall Street’s analysis. Analysts believe it’s underpriced by roughly $15 per share. Gurufocus, a technical-analysis screener, believes Skyworks is much more deeply discounted. It estimates that SWKS shares have approximately $70 of upside.Story continuesThe firm’s strong performance seems to substantiate these upbeat views. Skyworks Solutions exceeded consensus revenue expectations while posting record cash flows in Q1. The company continued to build relationships with leading firms across IT, EVs, and data centers, each a promising growth area in its own right. Skyworks has grown revenue by 20.2% over the last three years, ahead of more than two-thirds of its semiconductor competitors.MaxLinear (MXL)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockMaxLinear (NASDAQ:MXL) is another undervalued semiconductor stock worth considering. The company is focused on the realization of multi-gig connectivity. In other words, MaxLinear creates technology that allows internet speeds over 1 gigabit per second. So, the company’s appeal is in fulfilling our ever-increasing demand for more critical information at incredible speeds.Current estimates suggest that MXL stock has 33% upside above its $34 share price. The firm’s financial results support such a view. MaxLinear’s revenues reached $290.6 million in Q4, up 17% year-over-year. While that is a strong figure, it is still lower than the 45.8% revenue growth the company has experienced over the past three years. That slowing growth likely scares away many investors. This is especially true following a 2022 in which the chip industry struggled.However, MaxLinear still saw revenues increase 26% in 2022 overall. Net income increased, too. Perhaps most importantly, free cash flow from operations doubled to $388.7 million. These numbers suggest more upside could be on the horizon for this strong performer.Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is, in many respects, the opposite of MaxLinear and other smaller, rapidly-growing chip stocks. Intel is a massive player in this sector, but its performance hasn’t been beautiful. The firm has been in a prolonged slump, culminating in a Q4 performance that saw sales drop 32% year-over-year.Many will rightly argue that the company has suffered due to its incompetence. But the company has also faced severe competition as well. That means there’s reason to suspect that INTC shares might be oversold.Intel’s price-earnings ratio of 16.4-times is ranked better than 58% of its semiconductor peers. So, it’s not unreasonable to say that INTC shares could be oversold. Other traditional valuation metrics, including the price-to-book ratio, also indicate that Intel’s current price should be higher. It’s probably a less-compelling choice on this list, but Intel remains arguably a decent value for investors at current levels.ON Semiconductor (ON)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockThe reason that ON Semiconductor’s (NASDAQ:ON) stock continues to be discounted is its meteoric growth. The company joined the elite ranks of the S&amp;P 500 in June of last year following a rapid ascent that saw this company become a household name. Last year’s slide in the chip industry made investors suspect ON shares would fall too. That hasn’t been the case, as the company continues to exceed expectations. Yet, ON stock remains undervalued, an opportunity for investors everywhere.As mentioned, On Semi beat expectations recently, with revenues and earnings coming in just ahead of analyst forecasts. The company’s growth is something of a curse, though. Macroeconomic uncertainty caused the company to issue unfavorable guidance for the first quarter. Investors have grown accustomed to earnings beats, so the news was poorly received.I would rely instead on the company’s $3 billion stock repurchase plan as evidence that shares value will rise over time.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOn the one hand, it’s difficult to characterize AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock as ‘undervalued.’ Its current price is higher than its average target price after all. Technically-speaking, it’s ‘overbought.’So why do sites, including Gurufocus, place their assessed value $40 higher than current prices? While I can’t say with 100% certainty, I guess it has something to do with the company’s performance, especially in the relative sense.AMD’s sales increased by 44% in 2022 and 16% in the fourth quarter. Compare that to Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), where Q2 sales fell by nearly 33%. Micron continues to see operational troubles, even as it garners lots of press as an American chip-maker in an era where re-shoring is paramount.So, although AMD stock appears fully-priced at first glance, I’d argue that it remains undervalued. Capital could reasonably be expected to flow into AMD stock, as investors realize that performance isn’t consistent across the chip sector.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Micron Technology, suffered a decrease in sales of late, with Q4 revenues down 21%, to $6.05 billion. Last year, Nvidia’s revenue growth flattened, and its net income dropped precipitously. Yet, investors can’t get enough NVDA stock, despite this stock remaining relatively fully-priced.The reason is likely that Nvidia is doing more than enough to capture investor interest. The company’s data center revenues grew by 11%, accounting for over half of overall sales. That likely helped. And automotive revenues increased by 135%. That’s the key driver most investors have been watching, considering the amount of technology today’s vehicles require. As the EV sector continues to grow at a rapid pace, so too should NVDA stock.But it’s AI that is probably the overarching catalyst investors are focusing on when it comes to NVDA stock. Nvidia announced partnerships across banking and robotics that leverage its AI capabilities, making the company relevant in the futuristic world we find ourselves in.Nvidia is angling to carve out significant market share in the intersection of AI and enterprise. That will mean generative AI, chatbots, and other AI catalysts could drive NVDA stock higher from here.Marvell Technology (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) is an up-and-coming chip stock name. Its performance in the fiscal year 2023 was strong, which matters a great deal.The company has proven it can sell chips even in unstable macroeconomic conditions. The company’s sales increased by 6% in the most recent quarter, and by 33% over the last year. Remember, Nvidia’s sales were relatively flat over the same period. That’s a solid testament to Marvell Technology. The company is coming off its best year in terms of sales in its history.Surging sectors including 5G, auto, enterprise networking, and cloud growth drove the company’s strong performance. Marvell Technology has aligned its business operations with some of the fastest-growing semiconductor sectors as we near the midpoint of 2023.Yet, MRVL stock remains undervalued based on its average target price of $56.35, while it currently trades for around $40. The company is still producing losses, but those losses have narrowed to $163.5 million at year’s end from $421 million a year earlier.

LMT recently clinched a contract for the procurement of submarine modernization kits, equipment and installation. The deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $73.1 million, the contract is expected to be complete by August 2025. The work related to this deal will be carried out in Syracuse, NY.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The rise in security threats and the changing dynamics of the defense world have led to increased defense spending by nations on weapons and arms, highlighting the fortified demand for defense products for defense companies. In this context, amplified spending on military submarines and related parts has also been witnessed to advance high-end tactical undersea warfare capabilities.The U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget proposal highlights $48.1 billion worth of investments for sea power. These include the construction of warships and submarines. Consequently, this should benefit LMT as the company designs, develops and integrates submarine combat systems for the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Spain and others.Going forward, per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the global submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% over the 2022-2031 period.Such probable growth prospects exemplify immense opportunities for companies like Lockheed Martin to win multiple contracts involving submarines and related parts, like the latest one. This should bolster the revenue generation prospects of the company from the submarine line of business.Peer ProspectsApart from Lockheed Martin, defense companies that are likely to reap the benefits of additional spending on submarines and a probable inflow of orders are as follows:General Dynamics’ GD Marine Systems segment is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines. The company is investing $1.8 billion of capital in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support growth in submarine construction.Story continuesGeneral Dynamics has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%.

Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe are already leading the defense market.It is imperative to mention in this context that military aircraft, both manned and unmanned, form an integral part of a country’s defense products. Notably, the emerging trends in the combat aircraft space, such as fifth-generation technology aircraft, advanced composite materials and stealth technology have been substantially driving demand for military jets.The global military jet market is expanding, with North America leading this space. Boeing, being the largest jet maker in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft market. The company thus enjoys a frequent flow of contracts for military jets and associated upgrades. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 period. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending.

Lululemon often gets overshadowed by its larger competitor in the news, but as its stock performance has shown, overlooking Lululemon in favor of Nike may be a mistake for investors.Lululemon Is Eating Nike's LunchLULU Data by GuruFocusWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with LULU. Click here to check it out. LULU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LULUPeter Lynch Chart of LULUConsidering its history of acquiring market share and achieving consistent profit growth, I believe Lululemon shows great potential as an investment opportunity. This article will examine the favorable market trends driving the company's positive fundamentals and explain how its business model capitalizes on them to the fullest extent. Even though Lululemon's stock is trading at a premium, in light of its recent performance I still believe the stock has potential for long-term growth, though value investors may want to steer clear for now.Thriving direct-to-consumer salesLululemon has implemented a direct-to-consumer business model that has enabled the company to take ownership of most of its sales channels. In the fourth quarter, brick-and-mortar stores accounted for $1.1 billion in sales, reflecting a 15% year-over-year increase.Meanwhile, e-commerce sales constituted almost 52% of total revenue, with $1.4 billion in sales, representing a 37% year-over-year increase. Lululemon's wholesale revenue accounted for only 8% of its total revenue, with over 90% of sales made directly to consumers through company-owned stores or online.Control over distribution has significantly affected the company's ability to earn higher profit margins by eliminating intermediaries. The growth of e-commerce sales has also been a boon for Lululemon, allowing it to thrive during a difficult period. Beyond simply supporting the company's online business, the pandemic accelerated Lululemon's progress towards its 2023 objective of doubling its e-commerce business, reaching this milestone three years ahead of schedule.Story continuesTaking market share in a competitive spaceLululemon's exceptional progress so far is proof of its immense growth potential in the years to come. The global activewear market is projected to experience substantial growth between 2021 and 2028, as per Statista. As of 2022, the size of the worldwide sportswear market was approximately $319.4 billion according to Statista, and it is forecasted to surge past $450 billion by 2028. Despite Lululemon's significant rise so far, there is still plenty of room for growth.One of the key factors that has enabled Lululemon to grab market share is its distribution control. Its tight grip over its distribution channels has helped the company maintain a strong hold over its branding, leading to increased customer share of mind. Lululemon gained 2.3% of market share in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2022, despite a 5% decline in revenue for the sports-apparel category. This decline may indicate customers are turning to premium brands like Lululemon rather than weaker competitors.Lululemon's innovative business model is another factor that has contributed to its growth. The company is known for its unique customer experience, including a personalized shopping approach, high-quality products and exceptional customer service. This has helped Lululemon foster a loyal customer base and establish a strong brand image. Lululemon's capability to adjust to shifting market trends has kept the company ahead of the curve.Lululemon's growth has also been significantly driven by its expansion into new markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. The company has been gradually increasing its presence in international markets. This has helped Lululemon tap into new customer bases and diversify its revenue streams.Why profits could keep growingWhen comparing Lululemon to Nike, it is clear that Lululemon has outperformed Nike in terms of several key metrics. Over the past decade, Lululemon has grown sales by an average of almost 20% annually. This rate is significantly higher than Nike's average revenue growth rate of 8.7% per year during the same period. In fact, during the last five-year period, Lululemon's average revenue per share growth rate was an impressive 25.80% per year, compared to Nike's 7.30% per year.This trend is also reflected in Lululemon's earnings per share growth rates, consistently outperforming Nike's over the past decade. During the past three years, Lululemon's average EPS without NRI growth rate was 10.70%, while Nike's was 14.60%. Over the past five years, Lululemon's average EPS without NRI Growth Rate was 27.1% per year compared to Nike's 15% per year. Over the past 10 years, Lululemon's average EPS without NRI growth rate was 17% per year, while Nike's was only 9.3% per year.The past doesn't guarantee future results, but considering that Nike's market cap is still more than four times that of Lululemon, I find it easy to be optimistic on Lululemon's growth runway.Valuation is a sore spotLululemon's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report showcased impressive revenue and earnings growth, with revenue rising by 30.3% to $2.77 billion and earnings per share coming in at $4.40, which exceeded expectations and drove a 13% jump in the share price. Total comparable sales rose by 27%, with comparable store sales up by 15% and direct-to-consumer net revenue increasing by 37%. Although inventories increased by 50% from the same period in 2021, this was still below the 85% surge observed in the third fiscal quarter.Chief financial officer Meghan Frank expressed confidence in the company's performance, stating that it remained balanced across product categories, channels and regions. Lululemon is optimistic about delivering sustained growth and long-term value for stakeholders in the future, with anticipated fiscal 2023 EPS of $11.50 to $11.72 and sales between $9.3 billion and $9.41 billion, which is higher than analysts' expectations.Despite Lululemon's strong performance, its shares are now considered overvalued, with a price-earnings ratio of 54.54. This valuation is even higher than Nike's price-earnings ratio of 34.65.Although there are indications that the cycle of interest rate hikes is ending, there are still concerns about the state of the economy. Paying a premium under these circumstances may not be a wise choice. Despite the strong performance and growth prospects of Lululemon, investors should exercise caution and consider the company's valuation before making investment decisions.TakeawayLululemon has experienced impressive revenue and earnings growth over the past decade, outpacing its main competitor, Nike. However, the stock's valuation remains stretched even after the Covid market bubble popped. Thus, for value-minded investors, the current valuation may be too high.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

That's according to new research from BMO Capital that cites the 10-Q and suggests that after three years of going all in on its direct channels, Nike might need to reconsider that DTC and wholesale strategy. Here to weigh in is the man behind the note, BMO Capital Markets managing director and senior analyst specializing in retail that's Simeon Siegel. Simeon, it's good to see you.This has been such an interesting move that we've seen over the past few years from Nike. And it's had all kinds of effects on its relationships with its vendors like a Foot Locker, for example. Does it need to pivot backwards or what do you think a new strategy needs to look like here?SIMEON SIEGEL: Gosh, Julie, you just made me probably the only person in the world that can make Nike sound less fun here. Like the amount of words there, technically speaking. Now so you and I have been talking about this for a bit. I think that there is this view that you eliminate wholesale, you eliminate a fee. That must naturally be better. And it is surprising, but mathematically, it just doesn't work.And so what we're seeing is we're seeing the growth-- someone is paying that cost. Now it's Nike as opposed to letting someone else do it for them. And so I think it was this magic word called omnichannel, and we forgot about it. We started gravitating toward e-com, and we started gravitating towards direct.And the reality is Nike is where they are. They are one of the largest sellers of products in stores in the world because they embrace all the channels. And so I think you have to be strategic. Don't sell through everyone. Don't just give away your product simply to sell more units. But to say we're just going to move away from wholesale, I mean, that we are seeing mathematically, as damaging.Story continues- Simeon, I've had a lot of great conversations with the President of consumer and marketplace over at Nike, which is Heidi O'Neill. And particularly, the environment that they've been able to take advantage of with direct to consumer and growing out that Nike direct business, it's been one that was largely started by some of their other competitors. And Nike, of course, had the size, the scale to be able to make a huge, not just ripple effect, but a wave within the way that athletic footwear and apparel was then sold to their own customers.But we've seen kind of a pullback in some consumer discretionary dollars. So my question to you is, how much of the growth story right now is really just hinging on that pullback in some of the demand? And people looking around, perhaps their apartment here in New York City where you only got one closet, saying, you know what? I might have too many shoes at this point.SIMEON SIEGEL: No. God forbid. God forbid. No. Listen, I think there's a lot of different aspects. I think we're watching wholesale do really well. I think we can't go-- we can't talk about Nike strength right now without acknowledging some weakness at a very large competitor because they are no longer selling Yeezys.I think there is some element here where there is a timing factor. But I think more than anything, Nike has never struggled to sell more units. I think the question is where, how, and how much do you get for it. That's the fascinating stat that we saw this quarter. Nike revenues were up 14%. That is a huge number off of a very huge base.The problem? Nike profit. The actual operating profit dollars were down almost 14%, too. And so like, Julie, it goes back to the conversation you and I have been having throughout the pandemic, of the sell less, charge more. If you sell more, and you make less money for it, is it a good trade? And so I think it's fascinating.I think the demand is very much there. I think the question becomes, how do we turn that into healthy profits? And so to your earlier point, the size and scale, no one markets better than Nike. No one can ultimately compete with their check size, whether it's R&amp;D, whether it's marketing. And so the question becomes, do they compete against themselves?And so that's where I think what we are seeing is the sequentially improving inventory. The sequentially improving gross margins. Less bad than it was. But what we need to internalize is also this growing expense bucket. And so when you're operating overhead is growing faster, that is what happens when you go direct. When you go direct, what you're basically is saying is I want to recognize the full revenue. I don't want to share the product margin.But by the same token, I'm willing to absorb all of the operating expenses. Letting other people absorb some of that operating expenses is how Nike got to the size and scale and profits of where they are in the first place.JULIE HYMAN: And then there's another sort of big picture question that I have been asking periodically, which is, are we anywhere near peak trend with this sort of the shoe craze and the Nike hotness in particular? Still upward sloping here?SIMEON SIEGEL: And I think, we'll see at the box office. I haven't seen the movie yet, but we're talking about the origin story of Nike hitting theaters now. I mean, I don't know if that's a jump the shark or if that's a feel the momentum story. But I think what they have been is historically fantastic. Nike hasn't always had a smooth run upwards.What they've been historically fantastic at is watching competitors emerge, taking their time to recreate the product that they need to create, find what the trend is by going back into their archive, but also embracing new technology. Using that spin. Using the size and scale. And then effectively implementing the next phase. I mean, remember there was-- I don't remember. five plus years ago when Adidas came in and created the Ultraboost and all of a sudden there was competition.Many years earlier, Reebok did the same thing. So I think Nike's beauty is there hasn't been a peak trend because they're effectively paying a lot of money to help craft it even if they're not the leaders all the time. So I think that's what we will see, but again I think at the end of the day, this is a very, very large business. I mean multiples higher on a revenue basis than other competitors. And so figuring out how high is high from that business perspective, I think will be important and will be interesting.And let's not ignore the fact that this is not-- the wholesale conversation is fascinating on both sides of the spectrum. It's fascinating on the Nike side of the conversation because they have so much wholesale, and now they're effectively moving away on the startup side. People took that same message.And that was the digitally native story. That was the perceived DTC story of let's just start by not having wholesale. And that has now been proved to be the wrong model as well. And so I think from that perspective, I'm less concerned about Nike demand. I think the question will be what does that parlay into profits?- Certainly. Two part question here and then we got to let you go, Simeon. First, have you seen the movie? Have you seen Air? Do we need to go see it?SIMEON SIEGEL: No. Not yet. We've been passed over breaks right now, but dying to. I'll get there.- OK. Done deal.SIMEON SIEGEL: ? How about you guys?- We'll put that on the Google calendar.JULIE HYMAN: Not yet.- Secondly here, when you think about the other sneaker companies that have said, running is resilient, especially in a pre recessionary environment and consumers trying to get their hands around costs for everything. From what they're wearing to up top to on their feet. For Nike, does that same resiliency hold true? It is a company, that you've said, is competing with itself and some part of the businesses might be hamstringing other parts because of the differing release schedules that they have.SIMEON SIEGEL: It's an excellent question. I think, if you think about discretionary brands, they're generally smaller than staple brands. So need based purchases can be larger than want base purchases. And I think the reason is because of replenishment. The running is resilient also recalls the fact that you wear your shoes.And so I think a big part of this is simply the question of the Holy Grail is creating a discretionary product that's also a replenishment item. Because at the end of the day, if you're walking on these or you're playing in these or whatever it is that you're wearing through these shoes, you're talking about your closet full of the New York studios that have unworn shoes.But when we think generally about the volume that Nike sells, these are products people are wearing through and have to come back. And so I think that that's this interesting dynamic as well where as long as you are discretionary with replenishment, and you have the marketing dollars behind it, you create a story that people feel compelled to keep coming back to. And I think that's been effectively the magic of Nike.JULIE HYMAN: Well, we'll see. And once we all see the movie, 1 we think it's peak--SIMEON SIEGEL: Let's see it.JULIE HYMAN: We'll make our assessment, and we'll have you back and talk about it. BMO Capital managing director Simeon Siegel. Thanks, Jimmy Simeon, good to see you.]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nike (NKE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.7% and 11.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Nike, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NKE Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.7% over the past month to $3.24.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nike.

Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) provides banking and related services. On April 11, 2023, Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) stock closed at $30.11 per share. One-month return of Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) was -1.95%, and its shares lost 52.97% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) has a market capitalization of $4.459 billion.FMI made the following comment about Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Our two most impacted holdings during this recent crisis were Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) and discount broker Charles Schwab. We believe both have sticky deposit bases, best-in-class management teams, conservative balance sheets, and attractive valuations. In both cases, outside of absolute contagion/panic resulting in a run on their deposits (a very low probability tail risk), we view the impact on the businesses as more of an “earnings” event, not a “balance sheet” event. Zions and Schwab got caught up in the contagious fear around SVB’s collapse due to some optical similarities between their balance sheets (namely bonds carried at mark-to-market losses), and Zions being a West Coast regional bank. We believe the similarities largely end there. Zions has a much more diverse deposit base than SVB. We estimate that half of Zions’ deposit base are small and medium-sized business operating deposits, which have historically been quite stable and a competitive advantage. Nearly half of Zions’ deposits are FDIC-insured, and the bank has ample liquidity to meet outflows without selling its securities portfolio. Similarly, Schwab’s retail deposit base is very sticky. Over 80% of their customers’ cash is FDIC-insured, and the cash is spread across approximately 34 million brokerage accounts (average ~$10,000 in bank cash per account). Schwab has more balance sheet liquidity than deposits. In both cases, there appears to be a low risk of correlation among their respective client bases. Although there will likely be some profit headwinds that stem from this crisis, we viewed the large declines in these shares as overly punitive, and thus believe the risk/reward for each is increasingly attractive. We have added to both positions.”Story continuesLargest Financial Services Companies by AUMZions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Do you think that these bank failures are isolated, or they are a harbinger of more challenges, tighter credit conditions to come? Is there contagion risk here?Story continuesPIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS: Well, certainly, the markets have been quite nervous in the last few weeks. And the financial sector has been severely tested by the increase in interest rates we've had in the last year. And that has generated losses for banks' balance sheets and non-banks as well, as we saw last fall, and also increased funding costs for banks, as they are now-- depositors are looking at how much they're earning on their deposit accounts or savings account. And they are asking, maybe, well, we should get a little bit more. And so that is a concern going forward.Now, the good news is that the financial-- the banking sector, in particular, is in much better health overall now than it was at the time, say, of the global financial crisis. There's a lot more capital. The banks are better regulated. There are all kinds of liquidity requirements, et cetera, especially for large banks. And so, overall, the health of the banking sector is much stronger. But it doesn't mean that there couldn't be pockets of-- liquidity pockets of vulnerabilities. And financial authorities need to be quite careful and monitor this because things could spread pretty quickly.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Yeah, well, to your point, how should central banks sort of walk this tightrope between managing inflation risk and the potential for credit tightening or liquidity issues? Do you think they should take a step back, like the Bank of Australia did, sort of pause and see, or continue on their way?PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS: At this point, we don't think they should take a step back. I mean, first, let's realize that most advanced economies' central bank may already be near the peak of their hiking cycle. So a lot has already been done. And then we should see the effect of that in coming months and the rest of the year. So there isn't really any indication that central banks would need to hike massively from where they are right now. Of course, there's always a risk that inflation might be a bit more persistent. But even then, I don't think anyone is anticipating very, very sharp increase in policy rates.But having said that, the second factor to take into account is this financial fragility is going to lead probably the banks to be a little bit more cautious in extended lending. And so they are going to contract lending going forward. How much is still to be determined. We don't know quite yet. But that's also going to weigh down on activity. That's going to cool off the economy, bring down inflation. And what that means is that central banks don't need to do as much because the lending sector is going to be doing some of it for them.But what's really important at this point is that central banks should not veer away from the fight against inflation for financial stability reasons. We don't think that would be appropriate. There are other tools that are available to financial authorities that need to address localized pockets of vulnerability and that doesn't require adjusting the policy rates or giving up on the fight against inflation.]"

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.29%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.92%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the drugmaker had gained 4.69% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's gain of 6.4% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.51% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Pfizer as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 2, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Pfizer to post earnings of $0.98 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 39.51%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $17.25 billion, down 32.79% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.49 per share and revenue of $68.28 billion. These totals would mark changes of -46.96% and -31.94%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

However, these changes are limited to Beyfortus’ U.S. rights only. These changes do not impact the terms of the agreement between Sanofi and AstraZeneca for territories outside the United States.To effect the above changes, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (“Sobi”) will enter into a direct royalty agreement with Sanofi wherein the latter will pay royalties on net product sales of Beyfortus in the United States to the former. This agreement intends to simplify and streamline the previous deal by AstraZeneca with Sobi.Sanofi and AstraZeneca initially entered into an agreement in 2017 to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Per the initial terms, AstraZeneca was responsible for development and manufacturing activities. Sanofi was responsible for commercialization activities. However, AstraZeneca sold its rights to participate in the profits or losses for Beyfortus product sales in the United States to Sobi in 2018.As a result of the new royalty agreement with Sanofi, Sobi will receive all payments pertaining to Beyfortus’ U.S. sales from Sanofi directly instead of AstraZeneca. Sobi has also entered into a new agreement with AstraZeneca wherein both parties have terminated the profit/loss participation rights related to Beyfortus entered in 2018.In the year so far, shares of AstraZeneca and Sanofi have risen 6.3% and 13.6%, respectively. During the same period, the industry has moved up 0.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn consideration for entering into these agreements, Sobi will pay $66 million to Sanofi and $15 million to AstraZeneca. While the amount payable to Sanofi will act as reimbursement of prior costs for the research &amp; development of Beyfortus, the amount to AstraZeneca is an upfront payment. Following these payments, Sobi will owe no further payments going forward.Story continuesBeyfortus was authorized in the European Union in November 2022 to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease (“LRTD”) in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. In the United States, a biologics license application (“BLA”) was filed last year for Beyfortus as the first protective option against RSV disease for all infants. A final decision on the BLA is expected in third-quarter 2023.Other than AstraZeneca and Sanofi, Pfizer PFE has developed an RSV vaccine to prevent LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by actively immunizing pregnant individuals. A regulatory filing has already been submitted by Pfizer to the FDA seeking approval for the RSV vaccine. Pfizer expects the agency’s final decision later this August. A regulatory filing for Pfizer’s RSV candidate is also under review seeking approval for use in older adults (aged 60 years and above) to prevent LRTD, with a final decision expected in the next month.Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines against RSV infections. The LRTD-RSV disease causes a high morbidity and mortality rate in older adults and young kids.AstraZeneca PLC Price AstraZeneca PLC PriceAstraZeneca PLC price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote Sanofi Price Sanofi PriceSanofi price | Sanofi Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAstraZeneca and Sanofi both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the overall healthcare sector is Novo Nordisk NVO, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Covid Treatment Stocks to Buy Today. If there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the world. The deadly disease, which first surfaced in 2019 and rapidly spread all over the world in 2020 became one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is staggering as well, with data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggesting that as of March 16, 2023, 6.8 million people have lost their lives to the virus; a figure that pales in comparison to the 760 million confirmed cases of the virus.These staggering figures have an economic cost to them as well, which naturally cannot be compared to the loss of life. Still, if the number of infections and deaths did not stun you, perhaps the projected economic costs will. According to estimates from the International Monetary Fund -  a global body that aims to help distressed economies - the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic will cost the world a whopping $12.5 trillion by 2024. For reference, the global economy was estimated to sit at $96 trillion in 2021 according to estimates from the world bank, so if the IMF's forecast bears fruit, then the economic damage from the virus will have eaten out a significant chunk of global economic output.Still, the pandemic also saw an unprecedented global response where vaccines were flown around to all corners of the world to aid the battle against the coronavirus. The WHO also estimates that as of March 11, 2023, a stunning 13 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Using the World Bank's population estimates from 2021, which place the global population at 7.8 billion, almost two vaccine doses per person have been administered so far - an achievement that has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in containing the virus. The rapid vaccination has ensured that as the world entered 2023, the trend of coronavirus deaths and cases began to drop from earlier peaks that took place at different times in different places of the world.Story continuesAt the same time, the number of treatments and vaccines available in the fight against the virus has also significantly grown. While initially, particularly in the Western world, a handful of vaccines from Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were available, nowadays, a lot of new players have entered into the market.These companies are entering a market that grew from no value to one spanning billions of dollars in a short time period. A research report from the WHO estimates that $141 billion of vaccines were shipped globally in 2021, for an approximately 3.5x growth from 2021 - demonstrating the scale of the global response against the pandemic. At the same time, it indicates that vaccine manufacturing is still a highly specialized process, with ten manufacturers accounting for 70% of all the vaccines shipped. Zooming in on the coronavirus vaccine market itself, Transparency Market Research estimates that the segment was valued at $92.6 billion in 2021 and is expected to record a negative compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% between 2022 and 2031 to sit at an estimated $9.9 billion by the end of the forecast period. To cater to this dropping value, the research firm believes that the market participants will have to inform the general public about the benefits of herd immunization, as well as leverage their existing vaccine development experience to develop products for other diseases as well. At the same time, it also points out that the market can grow due to potential new variants of the virus that render older vaccines obsolete and require already vaccinated individuals to get additional doses. North America is estimated to be the most valuable vaccine market, with Europe coming in at second place.Pivoting from existing vaccine development experience to create new products is a trend that has already emerged in the market. The clearest example of this is Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), a company that few people had heard about prior to the pandemic and its Spikevax vaccine that was one of the most - if not the most - effective treatments to prevent severe viral infection. At its latest earnings call, the firm's president, Mr. Stephen Hoge shed some light on its diverse portfolio of fighting other respiratory infections, as he outlined:Lastly, our respiratory portfolio includes a large number of combination vaccines to provide protection against multiple respiratory pathogens which has advantages for many stakeholders, including healthcare providers, payers and consumers. These include combinations of COVID, flu and RSV as well as two pediatric vaccines that include additional viruses that are important in children, including hMPV and PIV3. As we prepare for endemic COVID in 2023 and beyond, we wanted to briefly recap the recent VRBPAC committee discussions and recommendations. At the January VRBPAC meeting, the committee voted to harmonize the primary series and booster dose vaccines, which is an important step to simplify future guidance. The FDA also indicated that it expects to convene VRBPAC to determine vaccine strain composition for the €˜23/24 season in the second quarter of this year.We believe that our mRNA platform has demonstrated its ability to deliver variant match vaccines on accelerated time horizons and we believe we are therefore well positioned to deliver whatever composition update the FDA and other public health agencies recommend. And moving to RSV, as you know, we shared the top line results from our Phase 3 RSV study in older adults earlier this year. And today, we shared additional data that was presented this morning at RSVVW. The top line results we have seen are incredibly encouraging and we are grateful to the FDA for breakthrough therapy designation for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need. In the top line data presented in January, the mRNA-1345 demonstrated 83.7% vaccine efficacy and the primary endpoint of lower respiratory tract disease with two or more symptoms.Today, we'll look at some covid treatment stocks, a list that also includes GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), and Novavax, Inc.

The drugs account for more than half of all U.S. abortions.STATES TAKE ACTIONIn response to Kacsmaryk's decision, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said his state had secured an ""emergency stockpile"" of up to 2 million misoprostol pills.Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, also a Democrat, on Monday said her state is stockpiling mifepristone. Washington's Democratic Governor Jay Inslee took similar action last week.Story continuesMifepristone is available under the brand name Mifeprex and as a generic. Danco Laboratories LLC, which makes Mifeprex, is also appealing Kacsmaryk's decision.Separately, more than 300 biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry executives including Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Albert Bourla signed an open letter calling for a reversal of the judge's decision.Kacsmaryk stayed his decision for seven days to allow the Biden administration time to appeal.The Justice Department asked the appeals court to extend the stay by April 13, and that a stay remain in place until any appeals, including to the Supreme Court, are resolved.Erin Hawley, a lawyer representing the anti-abortion groups, said in a statement on Monday: ""By illegally approving dangerous chemical abortion drugs, and imposing its mail-order abortion regime, the FDA put women in harm's way, and the agency should be held accountable.""Kacsmaryk ruled just 18 minutes before a federal judge in Washington state issued a contradictory ruling that directed the FDA to keep the drug available in 17 states.In a Monday filing in that case, the Justice Department asked the judge there to clarify what should happen if Kacsmaryk's order took effect.WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS FDAThe conflicting rulings could foreshadow a resolution by the Supreme Court, which last June overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, eliminating a constitutional right to abortion.The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. The New Orleans-based 5th Circuit also has a conservative reputation, with three-quarters of its active judges appointed by Republican presidents.""This administration stands by the FDA and is prepared for this legal fight, and we will continue our work to protect reproductive rights,"" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said.Twenty-three Democratic-led or leaning states plus Washington, D.C. also urged a reversal of Kacsmaryk's decision, saying the Supreme Court left it to elected officials to safeguard abortion access in states that allow the procedure.Monday's appeal came in a case brought by anti-abortion groups led by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, which was formed last August.They accused the FDA of failing to consider during its approval process for mifepristone the drug's safety when used by girls under age 18.The plaintiffs sought a sympathetic court by suing in Amarillo, where Kacsmaryk is the only federal district judge.Kacsmaryk had written critically about Roe v. Wade, and the former Christian legal activist's courtroom is a popular destination for conservatives challenging Biden policies.Twelve U.S. states ban abortion, while 14 others ban it at some point after six to 22 weeks of pregnancy, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.Some abortion providers have said they would consider a less-effective misoprostol-only regimen if mifepristone were withdrawn.The case is Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine et al v FDA et al, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-10362.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; and Kanishka Singh, Caitlin Webber and Moira Warburton in Washington; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Biogen President Alisha Alaimo has since also signed it.The White House welcomed the move, issuing a statement drawing attention to and quoting from the letter.The Department of Justice appealed the decision in a filing with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday. It asked that the decision be stayed by April 13, and that a stay remain in place until all appeals, including if necessary to the Supreme Court, are resolved.The letter was written by ReCode Therapeutics CEO Shehnaaz Suliman, Blackfynn co-founder Amanda Banks, and Ovid Therapeutics CEO Jeremy Levin, who is also a former chairman of biotech industry lobbying group BIO.The decision puts the entire industry at risk, the letter says, and sets a precedent for undermining the agency's authority to approve drugs, adding regulatory uncertainty that they warned would disincentivize investment in new treatments.Story continues""You have the real potential of having medicines not being developed because it's far too expensive, or medicines that are currently approved being withdrawn because they are political,"" Levin told Reuters.The FDA approved mifepristone, part of a two-drug regimen that accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions, more than 20 years ago and has determined its safety several times since.Health policy and legal experts have said that if Kacsmaryk's unprecedented ruling is allowed to stand it could undermine confidence in FDA's authority to regulate drugs, severely weaken the agency, and hinder access to new treatments.""If courts can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as mifepristone,"" the letter said.The ruling could open the possibility of the banning of vaccines and contraception for women, said Levin.""This is a nightmare scenario for the industry,"" he said. ""It's the single worst threat to the industry in over 50 years.""(Reporting by Michael Erman in New York and Ahmed Aboulenein in Washington; Additional reporting by Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

272,f2b3b4c5-d220-3bff-9ebd-c1b8f339437f,FOXA,2023-04-12,Fox attorneys in libel case reveal dual roles for Murdoch,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dominion-discuss-general-threats-fox-194225334.html,1681242145,STORY,['FOXA'],"[WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Attorneys defending Fox in a defamation case related to false claims about the 2020 election withheld critical information about the role company founder Rupert Murdoch played at Fox News, a revelation that angered the judge when it came up at a Tuesday hearing.It was not clear whether the development would affect a trial scheduled to begin Thursday with jury selection. Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox for $1.6 billion, saying it damaged its reputation by repeatedly airing false claims that the company helped orchestrate a fraud that cost former President Donald Trump re-election.The role of Fox executives is at the heart of the case. The company’s attorneys have sought to insulate members of the Murdoch family and to keep them from testifying live before a jury, arguing that their roles at the parent company, Fox Corp., put them at a distance from the Fox News shows that aired the bogus claims.Fox Corp. had asserted since Dominion filed its lawsuit in 2021 that Rupert Murdoch had no official role at Fox News. In its filings, it had listed Fox News officers as Suzanne Scott, Jay Wallace and Joe Dorrego. But on Easter Sunday, Fox disclosed to Dominion’s attorneys that Murdoch also is “executive chair” at Fox News. The disclosure came after Superior Court Judge Eric Davis wondered aloud during a status conference last week who Fox News’ officers were.Davis was clearly disturbed by the disclosure, coming on the eve of the trial.“My problem is that it has been represented to me more than once that he is not an officer,” the judge said.Davis suggested that had he known of Murdoch’s dual role at Fox Corp. and Fox News, he might have reached different conclusions in a summary judgment ruling he issued last month. In that ruling, the judge said there was no dispute that the statements aired by Fox were false, but that a jury would have to decide whether Fox News acted with actual malice and whether Fox Corp. directly participated in airing the statements.Story continuesTo Fox attorney Matthew Carter, Davis said: “You have a credibility problem.”In response, Carter said he believed Murdoch’s title at Fox News was only “honorific.”“I’m not mad at you,” the judge later told Carter. “I’m mad at the situation I’m in.”In a statement issued after Tuesday's pretrial hearing, Fox said, “Rupert Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman of Fox News in our SEC filings since 2019 and this filing was referenced by Dominion’s own attorney during his deposition.”It’s unclear whether the judge will take any action in response to the late disclosure. But an attorney for Dominion said he wanted Fox to further explain Murdoch's role with the network, indicating the issue could come up when the pretrial hearing continues Wednesday.Dominion attorney Justin Nelson told the judge the disclosure has “a big impact” on the case. He said Fox’s failure to disclose Murdoch’s status at Fox News has deprived Dominion of “a whole bunch” of information from Murdoch as a custodian of Fox News records that it was entitled to have.“It is something that really has impacted how we have litigated this case,” he said.Tuesday's development was the latest to turn an uncomfortable spotlight on the network.Information obtained by Dominion as part of its lawsuit has shown that some network hosts harbored off-camera doubts about election fraud claims but nevertheless allowed program guests to repeatedly make them in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The case also has drawn scrutiny of various emails and text messages shared among Rupert Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and Scott, the Fox News CEO, about election coverage and the allegations by Trump and his allies that he was cheated.They revealed a chorus of voices, from Rupert Murdoch and top network hosts to producers and publicists, who internally cast the election-stealing conspiracy claims as crazy even as the network repeatedly gave them a platform. Internal communications also showed that at the time, major players at Fox were deeply worried about retaining pro-Trump viewers.In a ruling earlier Tuesday, the judge denied a motion by Fox seeking to bar any reference at trial to matters involving the Murdoch family, which owns Fox Corp. The judge also said he would allow jurors to hear some testimony about threats directed at the voting machine company, but only to a point.The judge granted a motion by Fox to prohibit any reference to specific threats or harassment directed at Dominion, saying he did not want the jury to be prejudiced against Fox because of threats made by people with no connection to the network. But he said he would allow Dominion to talk generally about threats it had received to show how it has been damaged by the Fox broadcasts.“It has decimated Dominion’s ability to attract and retain employees, because the company is under siege,” said Megan Meier, an attorney for the voting machine company.The judge already decided last week there would be no testimony about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.]"

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesThe CFO and Senior VP of Finance &amp; Operations, James Kavanaugh, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$134 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$131. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In total, International Business Machines insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like International Business Machines better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.International Business Machines Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of International Business Machines shares. In total, CFO and Senior VP of Finance &amp; Operations James Kavanaugh dumped US$5.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.07% of International Business Machines shares, worth about US$84m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About International Business Machines Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We'd practice some caution before buying! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Ray Dalio's hedge fund, and go directly to read 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio. Ray Dalio is an American billionaire investor who founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975 in New York. He has a unique investment philosophy that is based on principles of radical transparency, meaningful work, and the importance of diversification. One of the core principles of Dalio's investment philosophy is the concept of ""risk parity."" This means that he believes that investors should allocate their portfolios based on the risks involved in each asset class, rather than on their historical returns. Through these strategies, Dalio built his firm into one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds. As of April 2023, the billionaire has a real-time net worth of $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.In October 2022, Dalio handed over control of Bridgewater Associates to a new generation of investors and turned his majority stake over to the board. This team of investment professionals is mainly responsible for choosing stocks and making investment decisions. Dalio will remain the chief investment officer mentor and will maintain his position on the firm’s operating board of directors. Following this development, Dalio tweeted:""Hopefully until I die, I will continue to be a mentor, an investor, and a board member at Bridgewater, because I and they love doing those things together.""Currently, Nir Bar Dea is serving as the chief executive officer of the firm. Under the new leadership, the hedge fund plans to expand its international footprint and develop artificial intelligence technologies. Earlier this year, the firm doubled its assets in China to over $2.93 billion, as reported by Reuters. Through this, Bridgewater becomes the biggest foreign hedge fund in the country. The firm launched its China fund in 2018 and delivered an annualized return of 15.6% through October 2022.Story continuesThroughout his career, Dalio focused on the current economic trends and talked about continuous interest rate hikes last year. He also recently spoke to Bloomberg about the wider implications of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. He said that this fallout would result in declining debt and credit markets. Here are some comments from the investors:“It is likely that this bank failure will be followed by many more problems before the contraction phase of the cycle runs its course. We are approaching the turning point.”Over the years, Bridgewater has delivered strong returns to shareholders. We previously reported that the firm’s flagship fund Pure Alpha II delivered an annual average return of 11.4% since its inception in 1991 through June 2022. The fund’s Pure Alpha also outperformed the market last year, gaining roughly 9.5%, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500.As of the close of Q4 2022, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of over $18.3 billion, compared with $19.7 billion in the previous quarter. A majority of the companies in the portfolio are dividend payers and have rewarded shareholders with regular dividends.

Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.” Click to continue reading and see 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio.  Suggested articles:The 15 Best Selling Products Online10 Cheap REITs with Huge Upside12 Cheap Global Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts.On April 7, the Wall Street Journal reported that oil giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a potential acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin. Shares of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) surged by roughly 6%, on April 10, during trading hours.""There's So Much Money To Be Made Here""On April 11 Gilman Hill Asset Management's CEO, Jenny Harrington, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she discussed the potential acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) and her view on the energy sector. Jenny Harrington sees the potential acquisition as an opportunity for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to invest its significant cash reserves in one of the major oil assets available in the Permian Basin. She believes this move could put a floor under not only Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), but also other companies with Permian assets such as Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY). Harrington noted that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has 70% of its assets in the Permian Basin and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) has approximately 55% of its assets in the Permian Basin.Jenny Harrington suggests that investors should look at these companies based on their cash flow, and highlights the significant amount of ""money to be made"" in the energy sector. Jenny Harrington talked about the volatility in energy stocks and noted that even when energy stocks fall, she thinks that ""when the stocks come down to these trough kind of levels, they're really compelling to buy"". Here are some comments from Jenny Harrington:Story continues""Whether we like it or not, we are totally dependent on fossil fuels, and those are here and we need them. You see things like U.S. gasoline demand decreasing, it's easy to latch on to that and say ""oh everyone's running for EVs, who's gonna need gasoline anymore?"". But when you take a step back and look at the broader global scale you actually see expectation for global demand of oil increasing over the next 5 years. So this really is just a great reminder of how much money there is still to be made in this space.""Further, Jenny Harrington noted that she bought Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) within the last year, as she believes the Permian Basin holds the best global assets and future growth opportunities. She said that she concentrated her focus in the Permian Basin, and expects it to be the source of the best free cash flow.Some of the best energy stocks to invest in right now according to Wall Street analysts include Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”10.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”9.

We did so by trimming our position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a stock we added to the portfolio in Q1 2022. As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature. As the largest LNG supplier in the world, we believe Shell is particularly well-positioned to help Europe meet its energy needs as it looks for ways to replace imported Russian oil and gas with new sources after the embargo.”8.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”In addition to Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD), other energy stocks that Wall Street analysts see promising upside to include Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc.

Singer is already known for his accurate forecasts of past crises – the 2008 financial collapse and the post-COVID inflation spike – a record that gives his current prognostications a high level of authority.What Singer sees now is a high-risk environment in which the world’s central banks are highly likely to make the wrong decision, no matter what they do. Describing the situation, Singer says, “I think that this is an extraordinarily dangerous and confusing period… Valuations are still very high. There’s a significant chance of recession. We see the possibility of a lengthy period of low returns in financial assets, low returns in real estate, corporate profits, unemployment rates higher than exist now and lots of inflation in the next round…”So what to do? Singer, through his activist investor firm, Elliott Investment Management, has been making big investments in two stocks that have shown they can keep posting gains; both of which have shown strong 12-month gains, and Singer has bought in for over half a billion dollars in each. We’ve used TipRanks, the world’s biggest database of analysts and research, to see what Wall Street analysts have to say about whether these stocks make compelling investments. Let’s examine the findings.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)Accounting for one of his biggest holdings in his portfolio (10.5%), and worth $1.47 billion, the first Singer-backed stock we’ll look at is Marathon Petroleum, one of the oil industry’s major names.Story continuesMarathon is North America’s largest petroleum refining company, boasting a market cap of $57 billion and more than $177 billion in annual operating revenues. Significantly, despite a fall in oil prices through the second half of 2022, Marathon was able to outperform the equity markets by a wide margin; the company’s stock was up 60% in the last 12 months, compared to the near-7% drop in the S&amp;P 500 over that same period.Marathon’s refining operations back up this performance. From its headquarters in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon oversees a continent-spanning refining network of 13 active refineries that can process 2.9 million barrels of oil per day. In addition, the company has a nationwide network of branded gas stations and is a major producer and distributor of petrochemicals such as naptha, benzene, butane, xylene, and propylene, as well as fuel-grade coke for industrial purposes.Marathon saw some solid gains in its last reported financial quarter, 4Q22. The company’s top line of $40.1 billion beat forecasts by over $4.6 billion and gained more than 12% year-over-year. At the bottom line, Marathon’s EPS, reported at $6.65, was $1.02 higher than expected and more than 5x higher than the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.30. The company managed to achieve these gains even as revenues and earnings have been sliding since the peak reached in 2Q22.Along with the top and bottom line beats in Q4, Marathon continued its policy of generous capital returns to shareholders. For the full year 2022, the company returned a total of $13.2 billion to its shareholders, a total that includes $11.9 billion in stock buybacks and $1.3 billion in common share dividend payments. The most recent dividend, paid out on March 10, was set at 75 cents per common share; at its annualized rate of $3, it yielded an above average 2.28%. Even after these significant capital returns, Marathon finished 2022 with $11.8 billion in cash and other liquid assets available on the books.This stock has caught the eye of Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who holds a 5-star rating from TipRanks. Jenkins writes of MPC: “The evolution of Marathon Petroleum continues to unfold in a positive direction — as dramatic cash returns to shareholders and asset base improvements continue to become more apparent. 4Q22 results show MPC is a top-tier refining operator with commercial excellence as MPC was again able to capture strong refining margins. Capital allocation remains disciplined toward shareholder returns, renewables investments, and optimization capital in refining/ midstream…”“While MPC has executed on its capital allocation and shareholder return goals, excellent operations, a supportive refining macro, and continued emphasis on returns by management drives MPC to be our top refining pick even after dramatic outperformance over roughly the past two years,” the analyst added.To this end, Jenkins rates MPC shares a Strong Buy, along with a $165 price target to show his confidence in an upside potential of 24% for the next 12 months. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here)Keeping with the bullish outlook, MPC shares also have a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 13 recent analyst reviews. These include 11 Buys, that outweigh the 2 Holds. Shares are trading for $132.69 and their $151.31 average price target implies a 14% gain by year’s end. (See MPC stock forecast)Pinterest, Inc. (PINS)Singer’s next big holding is Pinterest, which takes sixteenth place in his portfolio (5.5%) with a value just north of $785 million.Pinterest is a social media platform that functions as a visual bulletin board. Similar to other social media sites, Pinterest users publish and share their own content with friends or the public. However, what sets Pinterest apart is its focus on visual content such as pictures, graphics, and videos. This content is organized into categories, making it easier for users to browse.Furthermore, Pinterest has expanded into e-commerce, allowing users to create digital storefronts where customers can search and browse merchandise.As a social media platform, Pinterest has appealed primarily to women, who make up approximately two-thirds of the company’s user base. The user base also skews young, with the 18-25 age group growing faster on the platform than the over-25s. While Pinterest has been working to expand its appeal to male users, the company’s most recent acquisition activity – its June 2022 of the AI-powered online shopping platform THE YES – expands its ability to cater to its largest demographic of younger women.Shares in Pinterest have gained 20% over the past year, a substantial outperformance compared to the overall stock market, and shows that Pinterest has staying power.While the stock has outperformed, the company has been showing a mixed bag in its financial results. For 4Q22, the last quarter reported, Pinterest had a top line of $877.2 million. This was up 3.6% year-over-year, but about $9.5 million short of analyst expectations. The bottom line figure, a non-GAAP EPS of 29 cents, was 1 cent ahead of the forecast, but was far down y/y. The EPS result fell 20 cents, or 40%, from the year-ago quarter.Wolfe 5-star analyst Deepak Mathivanan doesn’t appear worried about the mixed earnings, but rather, focused more on the solid outperformance.“PINS remains one of our top picks for FY23. Admittedly, the top-line sensitivity is likely to be higher NT given exposure to discretionary verticals. However, we think the LT thesis centered on product enhancements, engagement growth, and monetization gains are still fully intact. New product launches and partnerships are likely to be positive catalysts for the stock through the remainder of the year. Shares trade at 23x FY24 EBITDA, a premium relative to ad peers, which we think is justified given the potential for upside to our year estimates,” Mathivanan opined.These comments underpin the analyst’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on PINS, and his $33 price target implies a potential one-year upside of 17%. (To watch Mathivanan’s track record, click here)Overall, PINS has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 23 reviews that include 8 Buys and 15 Holds. The average price target of $29.05 suggests a modest 3% gain from the current trading price of $28.15.

283,36f66fd4-a0dc-35b6-9fb1-e8e7b10ccd40,MPC,2023-04-12,Investors Heavily Search Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-marathon-petroleum-130001598.html,1681218001,STORY,['MPC'],"[Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this refiner have returned +6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Marathon Petroleum belongs, has gained 1.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $5.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +247%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.28 points to a change of -22.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.09 indicates a change of -40.4% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $31.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -19.2%. The $130.11 billion and $122.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -27.7% and -6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $40.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.6%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.30 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.02 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +25.2%. The EPS surprise was +20.04%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

284,2fa4e520-7a7b-3d26-9a9a-ee39c512b0ad,MPC,2023-04-12,Want Better Returns? Don't Ignore These 2 Oils-Energy Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001979.html,1681218001,STORY,"['MPC', 'PARR']","[Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) earns a Zacks Rank #2 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 2, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.18 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $5.18 Most Accurate Estimate and the $5.17 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Marathon Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of 0.11%.MPC is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Par Petroleum (PARR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Par Petroleum, which is readying to report earnings on May 3, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.40 a share, and PARR is 22 days out from its next earnings report.Par Petroleum's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 10.94% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MPC and PARR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

285,3986b409-1c00-38cf-9a3a-655e7dbb4d9e,MPC,2023-04-12,"If You Invested $1000 in Marathon Petroleum 10 Years Ago, This Is How Much You'd Have Now",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invested-1000-marathon-petroleum-10-123012997.html,1681216212,STORY,"['MPC', 'MRO', 'CL=F', 'GC=F']","[How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Marathon Petroleum (MPC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Marathon Petroleum's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Marathon Petroleum's main business drivers.Findlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity.  In October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Marathon Petroleum operates in two segments: Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation.Refining and Marketing: The unit’s operations include 16 refineries, located in the West Coast, Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent regions of the United States, having a combined crude processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day. Additionally, Marathon Petroleum – through its marketing organization – sells transportation fuels, asphalt and specialty products throughout the country to support commercial, industrial and retail operations. In 2022, the Refining &amp; Marketing segment recorded a profit of $16.4 billion.Story continuesMidstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP and Andeavor Logistics LP - publicly-traded master limited partnerships that own and operate gathering and processing assets along with crude transportation and logistics infrastructure. Marathon Petroleum owns 63.6% each of MPLX’s and ANDX’s common units. The 'Midstream' segment reported total earnings of $4.5 billion in 2022.In 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain – for $21 billion.As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 billion and a total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Marathon Petroleum, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $3,112.17, or a 211.22% gain, as of April 11, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 158.80% and the price of gold went up 22.55% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MPC.Marathon Petroleum’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream. But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the covid lows, the sector is not out of the woods yet in terms of cash flows that remain anaemic and well below the pre-crisis levels. In particular, the weakness in business travel demand remains a complicating factor. The continued increase in costs and expenses over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are other negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 6.03%, and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

286,1af86131-6c76-31ad-a834-65e7a8de6b25,TAP,2023-04-12,Investors Could Be Concerned With Molson Coors Beverage's (NYSE:TAP) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-could-concerned-molson-coors-164156084.html,1681144916,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[If you're looking at a mature business that's past the growth phase, what are some of the underlying trends that pop up? More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. So after glancing at the trends within Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP), we weren't too hopeful.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Molson Coors Beverage, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.045 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$26b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Molson Coors Beverage has an ROCE of 4.5%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Beverage industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Molson Coors Beverage compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Molson Coors Beverage.So How Is Molson Coors Beverage's ROCE Trending?We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Molson Coors Beverage. About five years ago, returns on capital were 6.8%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Molson Coors Beverage becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOur Take On Molson Coors Beverage's ROCEIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 20% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.If you want to continue researching Molson Coors Beverage, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Molson Coors Beverage isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at AES (NYSE:AES), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for AES, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$38b - US$6.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, AES has an ROCE of 7.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Renewable Energy industry average of 1.7%. See our latest analysis for AES roceIn the above chart we have measured AES' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering AES here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThere hasn't been much to report for AES' returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect AES to be a multi-bagger going forward. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that AES has been paying out a decent 35% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On AES' ROCEIn a nutshell, AES has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 146% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Like most companies, AES does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Dan Ives, Tesla bull and Wedbush Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst, joined Yahoo Finance to talk about the EV giant's latest moves.Ives says cutting prices is a great competitive advantage for Tesla, calling it “a massive poker move that's paid off.”He did take a moment from praising Tesla to highlight other automakers like GM (GM) for making a major impact in the industry. “It's a green tidal wave, the biggest transformation to the auto industry since the 1950s. But at the top of that mountain is Musk and Tesla, and everyone trying to play catch up,"" he said.Watch the full interview with Seana Smith and Pras Subramanian here.Key video moments:00:00:11 On price cuts00:00:37 ""Haters going to hate""00:01:07 On EV competition00:01:34 ""Green tidal wave""Video TranscriptPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So do you think these sort of five price cuts this year alone, is that really indicative of a demand problem or is it more about them sort of going after competition like GM and Ford and is sort of growing the market share?DAN IVES: Look, I think it's a softer macro. And I think we saw that last year. So you got to just read the room, rip the Band-Aid off and that's what they've done. So then the first step has been what I view as just a massive poker move that's paid off. But it's competition, whether it's 313 area code, whether it's Europe. You got [? Lucid, ?] you got everyone coming. They can't just sit there high in their chair and not cut prices.And I think that's essentially what's happened now. But because of the margins, they have that flexibility. Look, the heaters are going to continue to heat on [INAUDIBLE] no matter what they do. So far this year it's been a massive bet. Next week's important, just in terms of that margin story. That's really going to be the front and center.SEANA SMITH: Dan, how worried should Tesla be about competitors? Obviously it probably has something to do with the price cuts, but just given the number of EV models, new EV models that have either been brought to market already or with plans to come to market? A number were on display at the New York Auto Show this year. How big of a threat do you see some of those models being specifically to Tesla?DAN IVES: Yeah. I mean, it's still Tesla's world. Everyone else paying rent in terms of EV landscape. But in terms of everything [INAUDIBLE] the team are doing at GM, I think that's probably the one that could have the biggest ripple effect. That's competitively speaking, but you've got lower priced cars.You look at what's happening on the Cadillac. You got a lot of the models coming out over the coming years. I think that's the broader thing is that you have what I'll call an EV arms race going on. But I do not view it as a zero-sum game. I mean, I view this as it's a green tidal wave, the biggest transformation to the auto industry since 1950s. But at the top of that mountain is Musk and Tesla and everyone is trying to play catch up.]"
291,0dff4f15-90c8-3a0e-b9d7-538824dbca01,GM,2023-04-12,UPDATE 2-General Motors moves deeper into mining with EnergyX lithium investment,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-general-motors-moves-deeper-205913410.html,1681246753,STORY,"['GM', 'HG=F', 'LAC']","[(Updates with confirmation from General Motors)By Ernest ScheyderApril 11 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Tuesday said it will invest in lithium technology startup EnergyX as it expands further into the mining industry, the latest deal by the car maker to ensure long-term supplies of the metal used to make electric vehicle batteries.The global push by automakers to electrify their fleets has sparked a rush for stable supplies of lithium, copper, nickel and other critical minerals. Demand is expected to exceed supply by the end of the decade, fueling interest in novel production methods.Privately-held EnergyX is one of several companies developing so-far unproven direct lithium extraction technologies (DLE) that could help GM filter the metal for its Ultium battery packs from some types of brine that have been largely ignored by the mining industry in favor of evaporation ponds and open-pit mines.Brine deposits are essentially salt-infused waters found throughout the globe. Many teem with lithium, calcium and other minerals, and DLE technologies aim to separate out the lithium and leave the rest.As part of the investment, GM's scientists will work to help EnergyX commercialize the DLE technology, trying to succeed where it, rivals Rio Tinto Ltd, BMW-backed Lilac Solutions Inc and others have so far failed. GM told Reuters it believes DLE ""could be the most efficient method to extract lithium from brine sources.""The automaker plans to lead a Series B round of financing for EnergyX worth $50 million and to help finance EnergyX's future expansion across North and South America. Reuters first reported GM's investment earlier on Tuesday.GM, which declined to say how much of the Series B round it was funding, will have the right of first refusal to buy lithium from any projects that EnergyX develops.""We are committed to securing EV-critical minerals that are sustainable and cost competitive,"" said Jeff Morrison, GM's vice president of global purchasing and supply.Story continuesEnergyX, also known as Energy Exploration Technologies Inc, has said it aims to launch an initial public offering by 2024. As part of any IPO, private equity firm Global Emerging Markets Group plans to invest $450 million in EnergyX once shares begin trading.LITHIUM METAL FROM BRINEEnergyX has said its technology can make lithium metal directly from brine, a tantalizing prospect for GM that could let the automaker bypass lithium refining, which is widely seen as a key supply-chain bottleneck.The EnergyX investment comes after GM in January agreed to pay $650 million to become the largest shareholder in Lithium Americas Corp, which is developing the Thacker Pass clay lithium project in Nevada.The automaker in 2021 also invested in privately held Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd (CTR), which is trying to use DLE technology to develop a geothermal brine project in southern California.GM's investment is a major vote of confidence in EnergyX, which was stung last year when officials in Bolivia - home to the world's largest lithium resource - disqualified the startup from a DLE selection process.""This GM investment will completely change the trajectory of EnergyX,"" said Teague Egan, the startup company's founder and chief executive.EnergyX is building five demonstration facilities that it plans to locate in Argentina, Chile, and in the U.S. states of California, Arkansas and Utah. Potential customers would supply brine from acreage that they own in order to test EnergyX's technology, before signing any development deal.The sites selected in the United States are near existing lithium brine reserves owned by Standard Lithium Ltd, Compass Minerals International Inc and CTR, each of whom has selected a DLE technology provider but not yet launched production.GM said it is working with CTR and EnergyX to find the best technology to extract lithium from California's Salton Sea, where CTR has been trying to use technology from Lilac Solutions, Koch Industries and others to produce the battery metal.""With CTR we have a great resource and with EnergyX we have a great potential technology,"" said GM spokesperson Priscilla Zuchowski.

(""EnergyX"") and General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) today announced that GM Ventures is leading a $50 million Series B financing round in EnergyX, and has entered into a strategic agreement to develop EnergyX's lithium extraction and refinery technology. The collaboration is focused on unlocking the North American supply of lithium, a critical material for EV batteries, by using EnergyX's innovative process to maximize efficiency while improving sustainability for GM's rapidly scaling EV production.EnergyX's direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology portfolio can make lithium metal directly from brine and potentially in anode-ready form for EV batteries, which enables more cost-effective and sustainable lithium recovery to unlock a vast lithium supply chain in North America that may otherwise be unviable.GM is investing in every stage of the battery supply chain in North America, from raw materials, to processing, to cell components and full battery cell production.The extensive collaboration between these two American companies includes three key components:A technology development program to support commercialization of EnergyX's advanced DLE and refinery processes, which could complement or replace traditional methods of evaporation pondsAn agreement enabling GM to access competitive lithium offtakes for GM's exclusive use in EV production, including material sourced from North and South American mining companies contracted by EnergyXAdditional strategic financing for lithium production projects in North and South America, using EnergyX's technology to drive potential supply chain opportunities for GM""The EnergyX team of scientists and engineers have worked relentlessly for five years developing cutting-edge DLE technology to solve the immense bottlenecks that have limited global lithium production and supply chain,"" said Teague Egan, CEO, EnergyX. ""This single bottleneck (a massive lithium shortage) is the biggest challenge to scaling EV production. We will unlock lithium supply in the U.S., a pivotal move in expanding the EV industry. There are many ways of gauging success, but few are more rewarding than the support of leaders like GM. We're energized by GM's investment and will keep a 'Day 1' attitude as we pursue our goal of making EnergyX the biggest lithium company in the world.""Story continues""We are committed to securing EV critical minerals that are sustainable and cost competitive to maintain our leadership position among automakers,"" said Jeff Morrison, GM vice president of Global Purchasing and Supply Chain. ""The investment in EnergyX is a further proof point of GM's leadership position. EnergyX is developing a novel direct lithium extraction process that's not only cost competitive but also will reduce energy, land and water usage as compared to the current extraction and processing process for brine-based lithium. We are excited to be partnered with EnergyX on their efforts.""In 2022, EnergyX became the first firm to design, build and commission an in-field pilot plant in the Lithium Triangle, which encompasses over 65% of the known global lithium reserves. The company's LiTAS™ technology increases lithium recovery rates to over 90% from the current industry standard of 30-40% using ponds and hit 94% during their field trials. After a successful five-month pilot program proving the efficacy of the LiTAS™ lithium refinery process, EnergyX will scale those systems to more robust market demonstration plants located at five regional test beds in North and South America, followed by full-scale commercialization.This new round of financing, funded by GM and other investors, helps solidify EnergyX as one of the world leaders in DLE technology and will also enable the company to broaden its research and development efforts for pure lithium metal anodes and its solid-state lithium metal battery program, SoLiS™. Amid building a 40,000-square-foot innovation and manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas, to house its growing operation, EnergyX currently counts over 50 employees and will increase that number to 100 in the coming months.About EnergyXEnergy Exploration Technologies is an American company with a mission to become a global leader in the energy transition.

Amid the soaring popularity of its van, the BrightDrop 2023 model is already out of stock. Building on the solid momentum, GM’s BrightDrop will be providing 4,000 delivery vans to Ryder’s rental fleet through 2025. The company has begun accepting bookings for the 2024 model, the deliveries of which will commence in the second half of this year. BrightDrop envisions $1 billion in revenues by 2023-end and hopes to reach an annual production capacity of 50,000 EVs at its CAMI Assembly by 2025.The U.S. legacy automaker also released U.S. and China first-quarter sales data. For the first time, General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs in the United States during the first quarter of 2023. The company is on track to build 50,000 EVs in North America through the first half of 2023 and 100,000 in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, General Motors is also revving up the rollout of EVs across all brands in China. The company is on track to launch more than 20 new and refreshed models in China this year, of which 33% are set to be new energy vehicles. It plans to roll out four new Ultium-based EV models across Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick brands in China this year. Buick’s first Ultium model – the Electra E5 – will be launched on Apr 13.GM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The price cut ranges between 2% and 6%. Per InsideEVs, the base variants of Model X and Model S have gone through the most significant price cut of $5,000. This is the fifth time the EV king has slashed prices in the United States since January 2023.Per Tesla’s website, Model Y’s base variant is priced at $49,990. Model Y Long Range will now cost $52,990, while Model Y Performance will now cost $56,990 after a massive price cut of $2,000 each. All new Model Y vehicles qualify for a federal tax credit for eligible buyers. According to the company’s website, Model 3 RWD will now cost $41,990, while Model 3 Performance will cost $52,990. Starting from Apr 18, based on the new IRS guidance, the tax credit on Model 3 RWD will reduce to $3,750. The base Model S will now cost $84,990, while Model X will cost $94,990.Meanwhile, the company is also set to establish a Megapack factory in Shanghai. According to Bloomberg, the construction of the Megapack factory will start in the third quarter of this year, while the production of Megapack will begin in the second quarter of 2024. The factory would be capable of producing 10,000 Megapacks every year. The Megapack is a container-sized battery that can store enough energy to power an average of 3,600 homes for one hour. Currently, Tesla produces its Megapack energy storage units at its Nevada gigafactory.Rivian announced its production and delivery data for the first quarter of 2023. The EV maker manufactured 9,395 vehicles at its Normal, IL facility. Deliveries during the quarter were 7,946 units. The numbers imply a massive increase from first-quarter 2022 levels, thanks to the production ramp. In the year-ago period, Rivian produced and delivered 2,553 and 1,227 vehicles, respectively. However, first-quarter 2023 production and deliveries declined sequentially. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company had built 10,020 vehicles and sold 8,054 units.Rivian currently produces two consumer vehicles, the R1T and R1S, and also builds the EDV electric delivery van. The company also announced that it would release its first-quarter 2023 results on May 9. Encouragingly, RIVN notified that it remains on track to produce 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Notably, the company produced 24,337 vehicles in 2022, falling short of its output target of 25,000 units.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major EV players over the last week and six-month period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Next in the Space?Stay tuned for announcements of upcoming EV models and any important updates from the red-hot industry.

296,15f72f84-fa3f-35ee-bbc4-9c9811169c82,GM,2023-04-12,General Motors moves deeper into mining with EnergyX lithium investment,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-general-motors-moves-deeper-120705625.html,1681214825,STORY,"['GM', 'LAC']","[By Ernest Scheyder(Reuters) -General Motors Co on Tuesday said it will invest in lithium technology startup EnergyX as it expands further into the mining industry, the latest deal by the car maker to ensure long-term supplies of the metal used to make electric vehicle batteries.The global push by automakers to electrify their fleets has sparked a rush for stable supplies of lithium, copper, nickel and other critical minerals. Demand is expected to exceed supply by the end of the decade, fueling interest in novel production methods.Privately-held EnergyX is one of several companies developing so-far unproven direct lithium extraction technologies (DLE) that could help GM filter the metal for its Ultium battery packs from some types of brine that have been largely ignored by the mining industry in favor of evaporation ponds and open-pit mines.Brine deposits are essentially salt-infused waters found throughout the globe. Many teem with lithium, calcium and other minerals, and DLE technologies aim to separate out the lithium and leave the rest.As part of the investment, GM's scientists will work to help EnergyX commercialize the DLE technology, trying to succeed where it, rivals Rio Tinto Ltd, BMW-backed Lilac Solutions Inc and others have so far failed. GM told Reuters it believes DLE ""could be the most efficient method to extract lithium from brine sources.""The automaker plans to lead a Series B round of financing for EnergyX worth $50 million and to help finance EnergyX's future expansion across North and South America. Reuters first reported GM's investment earlier on Tuesday.GM, which declined to say how much of the Series B round it was funding, will have the right of first refusal to buy lithium from any projects that EnergyX develops.""We are committed to securing EV-critical minerals that are sustainable and cost competitive,"" said Jeff Morrison, GM's vice president of global purchasing and supply.Story continuesEnergyX, also known as Energy Exploration Technologies Inc, has said it aims to launch an initial public offering by 2024. As part of any IPO, private equity firm Global Emerging Markets Group plans to invest $450 million in EnergyX once shares begin trading.LITHIUM METAL FROM BRINEEnergyX has said its technology can make lithium metal directly from brine, a tantalizing prospect for GM that could let the automaker bypass lithium refining, which is widely seen as a key supply-chain bottleneck.The EnergyX investment comes after GM in January agreed to pay $650 million to become the largest shareholder in Lithium Americas Corp, which is developing the Thacker Pass clay lithium project in Nevada.The automaker in 2021 also invested in privately held Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd (CTR), which is trying to use DLE technology to develop a geothermal brine project in southern California.GM's investment is a major vote of confidence in EnergyX, which was stung last year when officials in Bolivia - home to the world's largest lithium resource - disqualified the startup from a DLE selection process.""This GM investment will completely change the trajectory of EnergyX,"" said Teague Egan, the startup company's founder and chief executive.EnergyX is building five demonstration facilities that it plans to locate in Argentina, Chile, and in the U.S. states of California, Arkansas and Utah. Potential customers would supply brine from acreage that they own in order to test EnergyX's technology, before signing any development deal.The sites selected in the United States are near existing lithium brine reserves owned by Standard Lithium Ltd, Compass Minerals International Inc and CTR, each of whom has selected a DLE technology provider but not yet launched production.GM said it is working with CTR and EnergyX to find the best technology to extract lithium from California's Salton Sea, where CTR has been trying to use technology from Lilac Solutions, Koch Industries and others to produce the battery metal.""With CTR we have a great resource and with EnergyX we have a great potential technology,"" said GM spokesperson Priscilla Zuchowski.(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Peter Henderson, Jamie Freed, David Holmes and Anna Driver)]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.General Motors Company has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. This means that GM's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.GM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.57, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 48.26. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.57. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.97.Another notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.67. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 12.87.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to GM's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of D.Story continuesGM stands above TSLA thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that GM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

298,390257fe-81c0-396f-a187-09c61ca33b5c,UAL,2023-04-12,Can Delta or United Airlines Stock Takeoff This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-united-airlines-stock-takeoff-214809604.html,1681249689,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL']","[Post-pandemic leaders in the airline industry should start to emerge this earnings season and Wall Street will be seeing if Delta Air Lines (DAL) or United Airlines (UAL) will be at the forefront.Delta and United are expected to report their fiscal first-quarter earnings on April 13 and 18 respectively.Let’s see what’s in store for these airliners as they release their Q1 reports going into a somewhat Covid-19 free peak travel season.Q1 Preview The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Delta’s Q1 earnings is $0.31 per share compared to -$1.23 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 36% at $12.77 billion Vs. $9.35 billion in Q1 2022. This is certainly an indication that Delta is recovering from the pandemic.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at United, its quarterly earnings are projected at -$0.61 per share compared to EPS of -$4.22 in Q1 2022. Sales for Q1 are expected at $11.42 billion which would be up 51% from $7.57 billion in the prior-year quarter. While United’s top-line recovery is impressive the company has had a longer path back to probability.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationYear to date, Delta stock is up +17% to top United and the Transportation-Airline Markets +5% performances while also beating the S&amp;P 500’s +7%.Even better, over the last three years and throughout the pandemic, UAL stock is now up +53% Vs. DAL’s +48% with both roughly on par with the benchmark and outperforming their Zacks Subindustry’s +9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBetter still, Delta and United stocks still trade attractively relative to their past from a price-to-earnings perspective. Trading around $34 per share, UAL has a forward P/E of 6.5X with DAL stock trading at $44 a share and just 5.1X forward earnings.Both stocks trade nicely beneath the industry average of 11.3X. Furthermore, Delta stock trades 78% below its decade-long high of 30.6X and at a 29% discount to the median of 9.2X. In comparison, United trades well below its extreme decade-long high of 747.2X and at a 42% discount to the median of 8.8X.Story continuesGrowth &amp; Outlook With both Delta and United’s P/E valuations very attractive at the moment, monitoring their growth will be important in determining if their stocks are indeed undervalued.Based on Zacks estimates, Delta’s earnings are forecasted to climb 61% this year at $5.17 per share compared to EPS of $3.20 in 2022. Plus, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to leap another 32% to $6.84 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, Delta’s sales are expected to be up 9% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $57.16 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be a 21% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $47 billion.Pivoting to United, earnings are projected to soar 234% in FY23 at $8.44 per share compared to EPS of $2.52 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 EPS is expected to rise another 18%.Sales are forecasted to jump 18% this year and rise another 5% in FY24 to $55.97 billion. Plus, fiscal 2024 would represent 29% growth from pre-pandemic sales of $43.25 billion in 2019.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayAfter going through Delta and United’s outlook both stocks do make the case for being undervalued at the momemnt. It is noteworthy that they currently sport an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum. To that point, both stocks land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as there could certainly be more upside. With that being said, more upside in Delta and United stock will largely depend on their Q1 results and reconfirming their favorable outlooks in the guidance they are able to offer.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

299,492ea3a7-47f7-3cc1-bbb5-3e52c0bec5b2,UAL,2023-04-12,What's in Store for United Airlines (UAL) in Q1 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-united-airlines-ual-150003577.html,1681225203,STORY,"['UAL', 'LSTR', 'KEX']","[United Airlines UAL is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 18 after market close.UAL has a solid earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 5.42%.United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc price-eps-surprise | United Airlines Holdings Inc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for United Airlines this earnings season.Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for United Airlines’ first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $11.41 billion, indicating 50.75% growth year over year. The top line is likely to have been aided by a solid recovery of air-travel demand (post the pandemic-led slump) and an improvement in passenger revenues (which accounts for more than 80% of total revenues).Driven by solid demand, management expects first-quarter 2023 total operating revenues to be up almost 51% year over year (prior view: up 50% year over year). Notably, higher capacity in the quarter is contributing to UAL’s top-line performance. As a result, the capacity is now expected to improve 23% from the year-ago reported figure (prior view: up 20%).On the flip side, high fuel costs per gallon are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the first quarter. UAL now forecasts first-quarter 2023 average aircraft fuel price per gallon between $3.31 and $3.41 (prior view: $3.19).For the first quarter of 2023, United Airlines now anticipates a loss per share of 60 cents-$1.00 against the prior expected earnings per share of 50 cents-$1.00 (provided with the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 17). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at a loss of 48 cents per share.UAL is likely to expect a loss in the first quarter due to an expense related to the new collective bargaining deal with employees represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. This associated expense shifted from the second quarter of 2023 to the first quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for United Airlines this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Airlines has an Earnings ESP of -22.87% and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q4United Airlines’ fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.46 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07. In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.60 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The fourth quarter of 2022 was the third consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,400 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,230 million. UAL’s revenues increased 51.37% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat their first-quarter 2023 earnings.Canadian National Railway Company CNI has an Earnings ESP of +1.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.

300,f0cbea47-a1ea-34b2-b076-c5c79989dff6,UAL,2023-04-12,Will United Airlines (UAL) Report Negative Earnings Next Week? What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-ual-report-negative-140002658.html,1681221602,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL']","[United Airlines (UAL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +85.6%.Revenues are expected to be $11.42 billion, up 50.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 34.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United?For United, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -22.87%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that United would post earnings of $2.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.46, delivering a surprise of +18.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.United doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, Delta Air Lines (DAL), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.31 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +125.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $12.77 billion, up 36.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Delta has been revised 1.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.82%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Delta will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PNC may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PNC Financial is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PNC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.66 per share for PNC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.61 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PNC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.39% heading into earnings season.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-eps-surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PNC has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for PNC Financial, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PNC is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2023 earnings before the opening bell on Apr 14. The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have witnessed year-over-year improvement.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on a decline in non-interest income and higher provisions. Yet, an increase in net interest income (NII), supported by higher rates and loan growth, and a decline in expenses were tailwinds.Notably, PNC Financial has an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an earnings surprise of 4.99%, on average.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteThe company’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of $3.61 has moved marginally downward in the past week, reflecting the bearish sentiments of analysts. Further, the figure indicates 9.7% growth from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $3.64.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.62 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 19.7%. Management expects the top line to be down approximately 3% sequentially. Our estimate for the metric is $5.63 billion.Now, let’s discuss factors that are likely to have impacted the company’s first-quarter performance:NII: The pace of loan growth during the first quarter slowed from the prior few quarters due to an uncertain economic environment, the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and heightening recession fears. Per the Fed’s latest data, demand for commercial and industrial loans declined during the quarter while commercial real estate loans, credit card loans and other consumer loans were up modestly. This is expected to have a positive impact on the average interest-earning assets of the company.The company expects average loans to rise 1-2% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $506.5 billion for the quarter indicates a marginal rise sequentially. Our estimate for the metric is $506.3 billion.The Federal Reserve hiked rates by 50 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter and 25 bps in fourth-quarter 2022. With this, the policy rate reached 4.75-5% in March 2023, the highest since 2008. Successive rate hikes are likely to have limited any further positive impact on the company’s NII.Management anticipates NII to be down 1-2% sequentially. Also, the consensus estimate for NII (FTE) is pegged at $3.66 billion, suggesting a decline of 1.5% sequentially. Our estimate for the metric matches the consensus estimate.Non-Interest Revenues: Since the onset of the quarter under review, uncertainty in the economy due to recession fears have dampened the equity market performance. Thus, asset management revenues are anticipated to have been negatively impacted. The consensus estimate of $346 million for asset management revenues indicates a marginal rise sequentially.Brokerage fees, comprising part of the company’s consumer services revenues, are likely to have been negatively impacted by the decline in equity markets. Yet, the rising rates and high inflation are expected to have increased transactions and spending volumes, thereby supporting PNC’s card fees in the quarter.Due to weak markets and global economic uncertainty, deal-making and IPO volumes crashed in first-quarter 2023. Thus, the company’s capital markets-related revenues are likely to have been adversely impacted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same of $316 million indicates a decline of 6% from the prior quarter’s reported number.Given the slowdown in economic activity during the first quarter, it is likely to be expected that the customers would have been utilizing available overdraft balances to fund business activities. This is likely to have affected the revenues from service charges on deposit accounts.The purchase mortgage originations are expected to have continued to decline in the to-be-reported quarter while the refinancing originations are likely to have remained almost stable sequentially. Also, mortgage rates during the quarter jumped, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.32% in March, up from around 3% in the prior-year quarter. The rise in mortgage rates has taken a toll on the origination market.Thus, these factors are expected to have hurt PNC Financial’s residential mortgage revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same of $150 million indicates a decline of 18.5% from the prior quarter’s reported number.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-interest income is pegged at $2 billion, suggesting a 4% decrease sequentially. Management expects fee income to decrease 3-5% sequentially. Our estimate for the metric matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Expenses: The company’s costs are likely to have increased on integration expenses related to the BBVA USA acquisition. Overall, technology investments and general inflationary pressures are likely to have inflated costs while wage inflation is anticipated to have escalated personnel expenses. Nonetheless, its focus on cost-containment measures is likely to reduce expenses. Management expects non-interest expenses to be sequentially down 2-4%. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $3.64 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model RevealsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for PNC Financial this time around.

For more such products, go to the 5 High Margin Products to Sell Online.Global Retail LandscapeThe year 2022 marked the year of decades-high inflation, closing in at approximately 9% around the globe, notes The Economist. Households have been facing an intense squeeze in personal finances, with 80% of consumers changing their spending habits to grapple with the effects of inflation. Tips on an anticipated recession coupled with spiking interest rates have further shaken consumer-confidence hard.Shopify notes that, on average, cart sizes are shrinking by 35%, whereby 50% of online sellers are witnessing less traffic and conversion rates. With a tightening grip on monetary policy, coupled with the rising interest rate, central banks have been struggling to extinguish inflationary flames and bring back financial stability. However, the onset of 2023 reflects a change in the projected recession, which was believed to have begun with the year, with many economists believing it'll probably start a little later this year, with others suggesting a soft landing. A striking 517,000 job gains, coupled with a 54-year low unemployment rate of 3.4%, are responsible for this moderated forecast.These flourishing job gains, in turn, highlight an increase in income and spending, making up almost 70% of economic activity in the U.S. As a result, consumption rates have also jumped up by 1.8% to mark a two-year high. Overall, the global retail landscape doesn't look unfavorable, with e-commerce playing a prominent role in online retail.Insider Intelligence forecasts the global e-commerce growth rate to increase by 10.4% and worldwide sales to reach $6.3 trillion worldwide in 2023. While this growth driver in retail is less impressive in comparison to historical growth rates, the share of e-commerce sales in overall retail has increased, growing to 20.8% in 2023 and 24% by 2026.Story continuesKey PlayersAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the leading online retailer in gross merchandise value, with estimated online sales of $780 billion as of 2022. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) trails close behind with $690 billion in online sales, making up 37.8% of total e-commerce sales.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the go-to e-commerce website for customers and is considered a household name. Walmart (6.3%), eBay (3.5%), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) (2.1%) follow the lead in online stores in the U.S. and are the most visited e-commerce platforms after Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the go-to place for significantly discounted prices in the US. In the Asian marketplace and beyond, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the market leader in e-commerce sales in both wholesale and retail.Seasoned e-commerce veterans, entrepreneurs, agencies, as well as brand managers are also leveraging the massive reach of e-commerce to sell their products. Apart from these established players, there are many startups emerging globally and targeting gaps found in the market. For example, the Chinese startup company - Shein - is a fast-fashion brand with an estimated valuation of $100 billion.All in all, sellers are using different products to make money. Some craft their products by hand, others use popular products from existing brand categories, and others create private labels and brands. The prime motive is to sell products that are in demand, offer less competition, yet have high-profit margins. E-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) are helping these sellers in this regard.Profitable Product CategoriesWhile inflation has drastically impacted customer spending, many product categories are trending based on customer needs. Popular categories since Q4 2022 include cleaning supplies, grocery, vitamins, and dietary supplements, according to a report by JungleScout.As such, it should be noted here that profitability isn't determined by product category only. It also depends on the niche chosen, price, product competitiveness, and cost of goods sold, to name a few. Even if a product category is less competitive, sellers can have more opportunities to make sales within the sub-niches.While a specific product category can be lucrative, sub-categories in other categories can be profitable too, and vice versa. For instance, Home &amp; Kitchen is a profitable product category, with 2% sellers having as high as 51-100% net profit. On the other hand, Arts and Crafts is a less popular category, but 10% of sellers report the same profit levels.Other profitable product categories include beauty and care, clothing and jewelry, toys and games, arts and crafts, and grocery and gourmet, to name a few. Many sellers report a net profit margin of 21% and above in these product categories.Overall, sellers have been experiencing growing profitability in the retail e-commerce market. 73% of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) sellers report a profit margin of above 10%, while 35% report it above 20%. Seller profitability has also increased amidst rising inflation, with 37% of sellers reporting increased profitability in the year 2022. This promising outlook for e-commerce means there are plenty of products that can help sellers make big money online.12 High Margin Products to Sell OnlineRadu Bercan / Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to identify the top 12 high-margin products to sell online, we have chosen products based on their average net profit margins.

(ISRG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.58 billion, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.13% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Would post earnings of $1.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of -2.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ISRG is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front is expected to contribute further. The risk of procedure adoption and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 7.9% compared with the 14.9% decline of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 7.5% fall.The renowned provider of minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery has a market capitalization of $89.98 billion. It projects 11.9% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Intuitive Surgical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, with the average earnings surprise being 2.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space. The company has also launched da Vinci X, an upgrade to its flagship Vinci Xi technology.Progress on the AI Front: We are upbeat about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Per Intuitive Surgical’s management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new approaches to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: Intuitive Surgical’s solid fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy our optimism. The company’s displayed strong segmental performance in the quarter under review. It witnessed growth in da Vinci procedure volume in the fourth quarter.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires the training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such training.Stiff Competition: Intuitive Surgical used to enjoy a monopoly in the market for robots used in abdominal surgery since the launch of its flagship device, the da Vinci System, in 2000. However, after the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition for Intuitive Surgical intensified.Estimate TrendIntuitive Surgical is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.3% south to $5.27.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.58 billion, suggesting a 6.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our first-quarter 2023 revenue estimate of $1.58 billion, suggesting a 6% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

CACC, SLM Corp. SLM and Navient Corp. NAVI.Industry: Consumer LoansLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2076101/3-consumer-loan-stocks-to-benefit-from-the-propering-industryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry continues to bear the brunt of ""sticky"" inflation and recessionary fears. Deteriorating asset quality as economic growth slows down is a major headwind.Yet, easing lending standards, which have increased the number of clients eligible for consumer loans and digitization of operations will keep benefiting industry players. Also, improving consumer confidence and spending rise on non-discretionary categories will result in decent loan demand. Hence, companies like Credit Acceptance Corp., SLM Corp. and Navient Corp. are worth betting on.About the IndustryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry comprises companies that provide mortgages, refinancing, home equity lines of credit, credit card loans, automobile loans, education/student loans and personal loans, among others. These help the industry players generate net interest income (NII), which forms the most important part of total revenues.Prospects of the companies in this industry are highly sensitive to the nation's overall economic condition and consumer sentiments. In addition to offering the above-mentioned products and services, many consumer loan providers are involved in other businesses like commercial lending, insurance, loan servicing and asset recovery. These support the companies in generating fee revenues. Furthermore, this helps the firms diversify revenue sources and be less dependent on the vagaries of the economy.3 Themes Shaping Consumer Loan Industry's ProspectsImproving Consumer Sentiments: The persistent inflation (though now somewhat cooling), recent bank runs, ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and supply-chain disruptions continue to weigh heavily on consumer sentiments. Despite this, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the Expectations Index (which shows a six-month outlook) increased in March. Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director, Economics at The Conference Board, said, ""Driven by an uptick in expectations, consumer confidence improved somewhat in March, but remains below the average level seen in 2022 (104.5). The gain reflects an improved outlook for consumers under 55 years of age and for households earning $50,000 and over.""Story continuesWhile consumer spending on highly discretionary categories will face headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates in the coming months, spending on non-discretionary categories is expected to improve/remain stable. This will thereby result in decent demand for consumer loans. Thus, growth in net interest margin (NIM) and NII for consumer loan companies is likely to be stable.Easing Lending Standards: With the nation's big credit reporting agencies removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since 2018, several consumers' credit scores have improved. This has raised the number of consumers for the industry participants. Further, easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet loan demand.Credit Quality May Worsen: Since March 2020, the U.S. administration has provided substantial financial assistance to individuals through various packages to overcome pandemic-related challenges. However, with the stimulus packages gradually stopping and the Federal Reserve signaling continued monetary policy tightening to tame inflation, there is a strong likelihood that the U.S. economy might be slipping into a recession in the near term.Also, going by the central bank's latest Summary of Economic Projections, the U.S. economy will grow 0.4% in 2023 and 1.2% in 2024, lower than the prior projection of 0.5% for this year and 1.6% for the next. These factors may severely curtail the consumers' ability to pay back loans. Thus, consumer loan providers will have to build additional reserves to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays owing to the economic slowdown. This will, thereby, lead to a deterioration in industry players' asset quality.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright PictureThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83, which places it in the top 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of an encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since January 2023-end, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 5.1% north.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on your radar, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year.The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 23.2% over this period while the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and Zacks Finance sector have declined 7.5% and 13.4%, respectively.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of price-to-tangible book (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing consumer loan providers because of large variations in their results from one quarter to the next, the industry currently trades at 0.96. The highest level of 1.55X and a median of 1.17X are recorded over the past five years.This compares with the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month P/TBV of 10.21X.As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV, comparing consumer loan providers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group's P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector's trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.36X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry's ratio.3 Consumer Loan Stocks to BuyCredit Acceptance: Headquartered in Southfield, MI, CACC offers financing programs and related products and services to automobile dealers across the United States, enabling them to sell vehicles to consumers irrespective of their credit history. Further, it is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by dealers on vehicles financed by the company.Revenue growth remains a major positive for Credit Acceptance, with the same witnessing a seven-year (2016-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.2%. Growth is primarily attributable to a steady rise in finance charges, which is also the main revenue component (accounting for 92% of total revenues in 2022). While finance charges are likely to witness headwinds from macroeconomic factors in the near term, the same will rebound once the operating backdrop improves. A decent rise in dealer enrolments and active dealers is also expected to support the company's top-line growth.Credit Acceptance believes in returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases instead of paying dividends. In September 2021, it authorized additional 2 million shares to be repurchased. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had 0.16 million shares left to be repurchased. Despite having a substantial debt burden, its high cash flow generating business model and low capital expenditures are likely to help sustain share buybacks.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally upward for both 2023 and 2024. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) firm have lost 1.4% over the past six months.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.SLM Corp: The company (also known as Sallie Mae) is the dominant player in every phase of the student loan life cycle. This Newark, DE-based company is focused on catering to private education loans, and providing savings and insurance products for higher education to students and families.The expectation of modest growth in enrollment will lead to higher demand for education loans. This, along with increasing tuition costs, is likely to enhance the company's prospects. SLM remains focused on enhancing its private student loan business, maintaining a strong capital position and introducing multiple complementary products. Management projects a 5-6% increase in private education loan originations for 2023.Further, the company is focused on expanding its operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and inorganic activities. In 2022, Sallie Mae closed the deal with Epic Research LLC to acquire a digital marketing and education solutions company, Nitro College. The deal will bolster its digital marketing competencies, lower the cost of acquiring customer accounts and aid in becoming a holistic education solutions provider for students.Sallie Mae has been focused on improving its NII by increasing the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in order to gain from yields on cash and other short-term investments. The rising average loan balance will support NII growth. Though the NII declined in 2020 and 2021 on lower interest income, the same witnessed a CAGR of 5.7% over the last six years (ended 2022). The company's target to grow the Private Education Loan portfolio will continue to support its NII in the quarters ahead.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 company have lost 16.6% over the past six months. Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 1.6% and almost 1% north for 2023 and 2024, respectively.Navient: This Zacks Rank #2 stock is a leading provider of education loan management and business processing solutions. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is one of the leading servicers to the U.S. Department of Education under its Direct Student Loan Program.NAVI is growing its in-school originations. However, with the increase in overall interest rates, the extension of the federal loan payment holiday, loan forgiveness proposals and programs are anticipated to create uncertainty and limit refinance loan origination volume in the near term. Nonetheless, over the long term, demand for refinancing loans should rebound once direct federal loan repayments begins. The declining unemployment rate should further drive growth in the Private Education Refinance Loan portfolio and enhance its business prospects.Focus on introducing new products leveraged with technology and cost control efforts will continue supporting Navient in the quarters ahead. Strengthening its asset recovery and business process outsourcing capabilities, NAVI has entered into several acquisition deals since 2015. Additionally, the company focuses on delivering operating efficiency and improving customer experience by building technology-enabled solutions.Its shares have rallied 6% over the past six months. Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2023 and 2024.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Since January 2023-end, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 5.1% north.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on your radar, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year.The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 23.2% over this period while the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and Zacks Finance sector have declined 7.5% and 13.4%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of price-to-tangible book (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing consumer loan providers because of large variations in their results from one quarter to the next, the industry currently trades at 0.96. The highest level of 1.55X and a median of 1.17X are recorded over the past five years.This compares with the S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 10.21X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV, comparing consumer loan providers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.36X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry’s ratio, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)3 Consumer Loan Stocks to BuyCredit Acceptance: Headquartered in Southfield, MI, CACC offers financing programs and related products and services to automobile dealers across the United States, enabling them to sell vehicles to consumers irrespective of their credit history. Further, it is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by dealers on vehicles financed by the company.Revenue growth remains a major positive for Credit Acceptance, with the same witnessing a seven-year (2016-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.2%. Growth is primarily attributable to a steady rise in finance charges, which is also the main revenue component (accounting for 92% of total revenues in 2022). While finance charges are likely to witness headwinds from macroeconomic factors in the near term, the same will rebound once the operating backdrop improves. A decent rise in dealer enrolments and active dealers is also expected to support the company’s top-line growth.Credit Acceptance believes in returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases instead of paying dividends. In September 2021, it authorized additional 2 million shares to be repurchased. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had 0.16 million shares left to be repurchased. Despite having a substantial debt burden, its high cash flow generating business model and low capital expenditures are likely to help sustain share buybacks.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally upward for both 2023 and 2024. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) firm have lost 1.4% over the past six months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: CACC SLM Corp: The company (also known as Sallie Mae) is the dominant player in every phase of the student loan life cycle. This Newark, DE-based company is focused on catering to private education loans, and providing saving and insurance products for higher education to students and families.The expectation of modest growth in enrolment will lead to higher demand for education loans. This, along with increasing tuition costs, is likely to enhance the company’s prospects. SLM remains focused on enhancing its private student loan business, maintaining a strong capital position and introducing multiple complementary products. Management projects a 5-6% increase in private education loan originations for 2023.Further, the company is focused on expanding its operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and inorganic activities. In 2022, Sallie Mae closed the deal with Epic Research LLC to acquire a digital marketing and education solutions company, Nitro College. The deal will bolster its digital marketing competencies, lower the cost of acquiring customer accounts and aid in becoming a holistic education solutions provider for students.Sallie Mae has been focused on improving its NII by increasing the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in order to gain from yields on cash and other short-term investments. The rising average loan balance will support NII growth. Though the NII declined in 2020 and 2021 on lower interest income, the same witnessed a CAGR of 5.7% over the last six years (ended 2022). The company’s target to grow the Private Education Loan portfolio will continue to support its NII in the quarters ahead.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 company have lost 16.6% over the past six months. Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 1.6% and almost 1% north for 2023 and 2024, respectively.Price and Consensus: SLM Navient: This Zacks Rank #2 stock is a leading provider of education loan management and business processing solutions. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is one of the leading servicers to the U.S. Department of Education under its Direct Student Loan Program.NAVI is growing its in-school originations. However, with the increase in overall interest rates, the extension of the federal loan payment holiday, loan forgiveness proposals and programs are anticipated to create uncertainty and limit refinance loan origination volume in the near term. Nonetheless, over the long term, demand for refinancing loans should rebound once direct federal loan repayments begins. The declining unemployment rate should further drive growth in the Private Education Refinance Loan portfolio and enhance its business prospects.Focus on introducing new products leveraged with technology and cost control efforts will continue supporting Navient in the quarters ahead. Strengthening its asset recovery and business process outsourcing capabilities, NAVI has entered into several acquisition deals since 2015. Additionally, the company focuses on delivering operating efficiency and improving customer experience by building technology-enabled solutions.Its shares have rallied 6% over the past six months. Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2023 and 2024.Price and Consensus: NAVIWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in CSX's (NASDAQ:CSX) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for CSX, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$5.9b ÷ (US$42b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, CSX has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for CSX roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for CSX compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsCSX's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 33% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.In Conclusion...In summary, we're delighted to see that CSX has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 70% return over the last five years. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with CSX and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ross Stores:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$13b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).So, Ross Stores has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Ross Stores.What Can We Tell From Ross Stores' ROCE Trend?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Ross Stores doesn't inspire confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 54%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On Ross Stores' ROCEIn summary, Ross Stores is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 44% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesIf you want to know some of the risks facing Ross Stores we've found 2 warning signs (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Ross Stores is not the only stock earning high returns.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: STMicroelectronics STM, Microchip Technology MCHP, Analog Devices ADI and Lam Research Corp. LRCX.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Amid Market VolatilityGlobal semiconductor sales have been slowing down over the past few months. According to the latest report from Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)  global semiconductor industry sales were $39.7 billion in February, with a sequential decrease of 4% and a whopping 20.7% drop from the prior-year figure of $50 billion. This marked the sixth consecutive sequential decline.SIA president and CEO, John Neuffer cited short-term market cyclicality and macroeconomic headwinds being the reasons behind the slash. A number of interrelated issues, like rising prices, geopolitical tensions and pandemic aftereffects, have combined to cause the current short-term decline. These elements have influenced consumer spending, and resulted in macroeconomic uncertainty and swings in semiconductor demand. Also, currency fluctuations and the fears of global recession are negatively impacting the semiconductor industry.Nonetheless, Neuffer stated that ""the market's medium- and long-term prospects remain bright, thanks to growing demand across a range of end markets.""Semiconductors are the backbone of the current-day technology-driven economy. Digitization across industries, the adoption of cloud computing, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning are likely to fuel demand for semiconductors.The accelerated deployment of 5G technology — the next-generation wireless revolution — is likely to propel further growth. Apart from this, blockchain, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality/virtual reality and wearables are other growth prospects.Story continuesIt is noteworthy that the semiconductor market registered growth of 3.2% to reach an all-time high of $573.5 billion in 2022 from $555.9 billion in 2021, according to the report released by SIA on Feb 3. Owing to robust demand, 2022 has been one of the best years for the market.Invest in Semiconductor StocksConsidering the bright prospect, it makes sense to invest in semiconductor stocks like — STMicroelectronics, Microchip Technology, Analog Devices and Lam Research Corp.— for long-term gains.The abovementioned semiconductor stocks are well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth prospect of the market.

According to the latest report from Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)  global semiconductor industry sales were $39.7 billion in February, with a sequential decrease of 4% and a whopping 20.7% drop from the prior-year figure of $50 billion. This marked the sixth consecutive sequential decline.SIA president and CEO, John Neuffer cited short-term market cyclicality and macroeconomic headwinds being the reasons behind the slash. A number of interrelated issues, like rising prices, geopolitical tensions and pandemic aftereffects, have combined to cause the current short-term decline. These elements have influenced consumer spending, and resulted in macroeconomic uncertainty and swings in semiconductor demand. Also, currency fluctuations and the fears of global recession are negatively impacting the semiconductor industry.Nonetheless, Neuffer stated that “the market's medium- and long-term prospects remain bright, thanks to growing demand across a range of end markets.”Semiconductors are the backbone of the current-day technology-driven economy. Digitization across industries, the adoption of cloud computing, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning are likely to fuel demand for semiconductors.The accelerated deployment of 5G technology — the next-generation wireless revolution — is likely to propel further growth. Apart from this, blockchain, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality/virtual reality and wearables are other growth prospects.It is noteworthy that the semiconductor market registered growth of 3.2% to reach an all-time high of $573.5 billion in 2022 from $555.9 billion in 2021, according to the report released by SIA on Feb 3. Owing to robust demand, 2022 has been one of the best years for the market.Invest in Semiconductor StocksConsidering the bright prospect, it makes sense to invest in semiconductor stocks like — STMicroelectronics STM, Microchip Technology MCHP, Analog Devices ADI and Lam Research Corporation LRCX — for long-term gains.The abovementioned semiconductor stocks are well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth prospect of the market.

Key will collaborate with community partners to leverage Regions' resources and business development experience in ways that support and strengthen a vibrant Black-owned business ecosystem. The initiative will specifically aim to reach entrepreneurs throughout the Magic City, including and especially in underserved neighborhoods. Key and a network of organizations will work toward the following priorities:Identify and amplify current resources for Black entrepreneurs: Already, various organizations offer mentorship, technical assistance, or even funding to help new businesses go from concept to reality. The Birmingham Black-Owned Business Initiative will raise awareness of existing resources and evaluate opportunities for providing greater financial or technical support for programs with a proven track record of results. The impact over time will be greater opportunities for current and future business owners to receive customized guidance in launching and operating a successful business.Address gaps where additional resources are needed: Often, the difference between whether a business succeeds or fails comes down to access. Did the business owner have access to the right tools and training? Was there enough access to capital and liquidity? What are ways the existing business community can help address a lack of access and help more business owners thrive? These are foundational questions Key and community partners will consistently address as they identify ways to reach more people with tangible benefits.Build collaboration that focuses on results: While many organizations share in the goal of building a more prosperous Birmingham, it is important for these organizations to have strong awareness within the community and strong collaboration to ensure as many business owners as possible are benefiting. Key and community partners of Regions Bank will work extensively to ensure business accelerator programs, mentorship opportunities, technical assistance, co-working spaces, potential funding sources, and more are increasingly available to entrepreneurs to maximize their likelihood for success and growth.Story continues""Over the last several years, Regions Bank has focused its community engagement on fostering more inclusive prosperity, and one of the most powerful ways we can build on this commitment is by creating new strategies to support and uplift Black-owned businesses in our headquarters city,"" said John Turner, President and CEO of Regions Financial Corp. ""Regions is proud to be based in Birmingham, and we are deeply invested in our hometown. By enhancing our collaboration with community groups and focusing more of our time and resources on the growth of Black-owned businesses, we can address an important need in the Magic City while strengthening the quality of life for more entrepreneurs, families and neighborhoods.""Turner is a member of the Board of Directors of Prosper, an initiative created by corporate, civic and community leaders to build the most inclusive and thriving economy in the Southeast. The Birmingham Black-Owned Business Initiative is a shared priority for Regions and Prosper and is designed to work with a range of organizations that are all united in the goal of helping more Black-owned businesses thrive.A recent Brookings Institution study reported the Birmingham region has the lowest rate among all large U.S. metro areas (53rd out of 53) for Black business ownership of companies that are large enough to have employees in addition to their owner. But many areas of the country are seeing an increase in Black entrepreneurship. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, Black neighborhoods with moderate income levels experienced a large uptick in new business startups between 2019 and 2020. Key and community groups are focused on ensuring Birmingham builds a positive trajectory through collaboration and innovation to support more business owners.""I'm excited about this initiative, which is a pivotal step toward a long-term goal at Regions to make a meaningful difference in addressing the plight of Black businesses in Birmingham while helping create a best-in-class Black business ecosystem.""Kendra Key, Senior Vice President in the bank's Community Affairs division""We have an entrepreneurial spirit, enthusiastic community partners, and higher engagement from the existing business community that recognizes the importance of a stronger Black-owned business climate,"" Key said.

Key's work will also complement the work of the Regions Community Development Corporation, which was established under Abrahams' leadership.""The deeper collaboration Kendra is building today will create a more prosperous tomorrow,"" Abrahams said. ""We are deeply grateful for community partners like Prosper and others that share a strong vision for fostering more Black-owned business success. Financial inclusion is crucial to the success of the communities where we live and work, and we know Kendra's experience and passion will drive tangible results in neighborhoods across Birmingham.""The deeper collaboration Kendra is building today will create a more prosperous tomorrow.""Prosper is committed to working with leading businesses, including Regions, and a wide range of community partners to empower more people with crucial resources for business success,"" added Prosper President J.W. Carpenter. ""We saw through the pilot launch of Prosper's Magic City Match program that Black-owned businesses are ready to grow, compete and succeed in the marketplace. We appreciate the leadership position Regions is taking and cannot think of a better person than Kendra to lead this work. As a Prosper Board member, Kendra has already had a tremendous influence on Prosper's work, and this has the potential to make a generational impact for entrepreneurs and families across our city.

(NYSE:V) insiders sold US$11m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-insiders-120028463.html,1681300828,STORY,['V'],"[In the last year, many Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Visa Visa Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Technology, Rajat Taneja, for US$5.4m worth of shares, at about US$217 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$228. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 9.1% of Rajat Taneja's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Visa shares, than buying. The sellers received a price of around US$218, on average. We don't gain confidence from insider selling below the recent share price. But we wouldn't put too much weight on the insider selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Story continuesInsiders At Visa Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Visa shares. Specifically, Executive Chairman Alfred Kelly ditched US$2.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Visa Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, currently worth about US$247m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Visa Tell Us?An insider sold Visa shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Visa is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Visa you should be aware of.Of course Visa may not be the best stock to buy.

In that same time, the Business Services sector gained 1.23%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 6.51%.Visa will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 25, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Visa to post earnings of $1.97 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.06%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.74 billion, up 7.72% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.43 per share and revenue of $32.24 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.4% and +10%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Visa (V).Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.35, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.35 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 78.3% and 8.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Visa here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Visa, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in V?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.43.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Visa.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

334,de2475f1-fd99-396d-a39f-4254a8c12223,MAR,2023-04-12,Bulgari Hotels Sees Unhurried Growth as a Way to Retain Its Cachet,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bulgari-hotels-sees-unhurried-growth-063000998.html,1681281000,STORY,"['MAR', 'MC.PA']","[A rendering of the yet-to-open Bulgari Miami Beach. It involves the renovation of the former Seagull Hotel in the heart of South Beach. Source: Bulgari HotelsBulgari Hotels &amp; Resorts opened its eighth hotel on April 4, the Bulgari Hotel Tokyo.“It has taken us 22 years to open eight hotels,” said Silvio Ursini, the group executive vice president of the hotels and resorts division of the Italian jeweler. “We’re not in a rush.”Yet Bulgari (pronounced bool-gah-ree) is picking up its modest pace. It will open its ninth ultra-luxury hotel later this year in Rome. Upcoming openings include Maldives and Miami Beach in 2025 and Los Angeles in 2026.“We want maybe 15 hotels maximum down the road,” Ursini said.Bulgari’s caution contrasts with the trend elsewhere. Many high-end hotel brands aim to scale up. Aman Resorts has 34 properties. Rosewood has 41 hotels. Over six decades, Four Seasons has arrived at 126 luxury hotels and resorts and 53 branded residences. All have pipelines for growth.And all of these hotels are in a rarefied atmosphere. A stay at the Bulgari Tokyo, for example, would cost $3,890 this weekend for a double room, according to a recent search. Bulgari believes that those rates insulate it from traditional competitive pressures, even without a loyalty program or a broad network of properties.“The economies of scale at this level are not so imperative,” Ursini said. “You can have one very successful, very profitable hotel and be perfectly happy depending on your business model.”That said, cracking the U.S. market is important. Its first U.S. hotel property is slated to open in 2025, Bulgari Miami Beach.Fashion TrendWhen Bulgari announced the move into branded hotels in 2002, a Morgan Stanley analyst described the effort as “an unnecessary risk.”Yet over time, it has returned value to shareholders of parent company LVMH.A few other high-end luxury names have played the hospitality game, but in smaller ways. Fashion house Giorgio Armani has a mini-chain of Armani Hotels and Resorts, starting with Dubai and Milan. Rival Versace has built Palazzo Versace hotels in Australia and Dubai, though it’s de-flagging the Australia one. Dolce &amp; Gabbana plans to build a resort in the Maldives with help from Saudi Arabia’s Dar Al Arkan.Story continues“Their approach to opening impeccably selected hotels in prime locations while maintaining an uncompromising commitment to the consistency of their distinctive design and brand values is not only the right strategy but also a risk-adjusted one,” said Joe Pettigrew, chief commercial officer for hotel asset management at Starwood Capital Group.“It’s easy to compromise the brand when there is too much focus on growth,” Pettigrew said. “They have over 100 years of brand equity and reputation at stake, and the hospitality business needs to be accretive to the overall brand.”What Bulgari knows — and others seem to be learning — is that the valuations of high-end jewelry and other luxury products and services make five-star hotels look comparatively reasonable, meaning that super-luxury hotels may still have a lot of long-term growth potential.Data compiled by Bernstein Research suggests that luxury hotel companies haven’t been grabbing growth and market share at the same pace as makers of personal luxury goods and luxury cars have since around 2009. Another long-term average pattern is that the disposable income of people with high net worth has kept growing faster than luxury hotel inventory, according to Bernstein’s Richard Clarke.A spa at Bulgari Hotel Milano. Source: Bulgari Hotels &amp; Resorts.Asset-Light ApproachBulgari set the pace with an asset-light model other famous Italian brands have copied. It doesn’t own its hotels but gets royalties instead. Bulgari taps the luxury hotel division of Marriott International to manage properties. Real-estate partners own the assets. Marriott collects a management fee, and the owners get a recurring revenue stream.It’s striking that Bulgari partners with Marriott. Luxury group powerhouse LVMH bought the jeweler in 2011, and LVMH’s “other activities” division includes Belmond, which runs a portfolio of hotels, trains, cruise lines, and safari lodges, and five Cheval Blanc hotels — a brand based on the vintner that was founded about a decade ago.Might Belmond someday shift its management contracts to LVMH’s in-house hotel manager? It seems plausible, though LVMH has historically run its “Maisons,” or houses/brands, as separate fiefdoms.No Loyalty ProgramBulgari insists on having the upper hand on branding. You would have to squint to see any reference to Marriott anywhere inside one of the Bulgari properties. Plus, members of Marriott’s loyalty program, Bonvoy, can’t redeem points for stays at Bulgari properties even though it’s one of the brands the group manages.“From the very beginning of the joint venture, which is still very healthy and prosperous, it has never, ever been a co-branding exercise,” Ursini said. “We don’t do co-branding.”Bulgari’s name doesn’t even appear on Marriott’s online list of brands.“Aman’s self-professed ‘Aman Junkies’ avidly follow that brand’s new openings, so will Bulgari encourage its guests to join something like a ‘Club 15’ to demarcate that they’ve stayed in every property?” asked John O’Ceallaigh, founder of the luxury-travel consultancy Lute. “I can imagine some of their status-conscious guests will be proud to say they’ve ‘conquered’ the entire collection — something that’s obviously much harder to do with the likes of Four Seasons.”Rather than maximize occupancy, Bulgari maximizes exclusivity. It forsakes the benefit of getting guests from Marriott’s much-vaunted loyalty program in exchange for having a clientele that people like actress Anne Hathaway feel comfortable being near.“Our loyal customers are very loyal,” Ursini said. “We have up to 50 to 60 percent repeat guest rates at our properties in Milan and London, for example.”Toward this goal of exclusivity, it has to accept that its properties will be under-used occasionally.“We have consistent rates worldwide to attract the same clientele,” Ursini said. “For example, in Dubai, the low season is the summer. Every other hotel drops its rates, and you start getting people coming in by the bus, and your whole service model goes belly up.”“We don’t do that,” Ursini said. “We stick to our rate even if it means only 20 percent occupancy. You need to have the discipline.”The vitality pool at Bulgari Tokyo, which opened in April 2023. Source: Bulgari Hotels &amp; Resorts.Looking for PartnersUrsini is looking for real-estate partners with property in markets with enough demand to consistently attract high-end luxury travelers.“A market we would be very keen on having is New York,” Ursini said. “But it’s already very crowded, so we would need to find an extraordinary opportunity.”“It’s one thing if you’re a brand trying to build 100 hotels worldwide, then you need to be in New York,” Ursini said. “But if you’re a jewelry brand creating hotels as a hospitality concept, then you cannot go wrong. I’d rather have no hotel in New York than have the wrong hotel.”Bulgari also prefers to renovate existing properties that have proven successful rather than do fresh construction.Proximity to the world’s best shopping is another strong preference.“Typically, in Western European capitals, you want to be walking distance from luxury shopping,” Ursini said. “That’s seven to ten minutes in high heels, by the way.”Bulgari’s Hands-on ApproachBulgari leaves operations to Marriott’s luxury division.“We know how to design and make jewelry, how to sell it, and how to communicate its value, but operating a hotel is a very serious matter that requires extraordinary skill at the highest level, and we humbly don’t know how to do that,” Ursini said. “Marriott’s luxury division has all the technology, expertise, training, and more to do that behind the scenes very successfully.”Yet Bulgari is hands-on in how hotels look and feel.“This is not a merchandizing exercise,” Ursini said. “It’s a matter of translating our values as a jeweler into hospitality. Our role is not a backseat role where we just cash in our royalties.”For instance, while Marriott hires and trains staff, Bulgari has checks to see that the staff are motivated and know key details, such as what a Serpenti necklace is.bulgari suite at bulgari milano hotel source bulgariDesign as Critical ElementThe highest cost for Bulgari is often the upfront expense to open a property. Consider the first Bulgari hotel in Milan in 2002. Bulgari set aside approximately $10 million (about €6 million) for design, the supply of Bulgari-branded goods, and other expenses, according to reports at the time.Design is an area where Bulgari weighs in with criteria.“The [real-estate] partner and Marriott know that we will drive the design ourselves with our choice of architects,” Ursini said. “A bit of innovation that we brought to the system from the very beginning was that architects of our choosing would design all our hotels.”Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel are the architects who design all Bulgari hotels today.A consistent part of the look and feel is to showcase high-end Italian design, such as furniture by B&amp;B Italia or Maxalto.Bulgari has learned lessons along the way. The first hotel in Milan, behind the La Scala opera house, started at 58 keys (guest rooms, essentially) and is now at 61 keys. But running city hotels at a somewhat higher room count proved more ideal.“You want a balance between intimacy and having energy in the place,” Ursini said. “”Paris is at 76 keys. South Beach is at 100. Our maximum would be 120. Occasionally a resort may run smaller. We have 58 villas in Bali. Maldives will be 54.”Blending Italian and Local AestheticsPerhaps the toughest job for Ursini’s team is figuring out how to incorporate locally relevant design elements into its hotels outside of Italy without sacrificing the Italian lifestyle it tries to encapsulate.The new Tokyo property offers one solution. It has an Italian garden on a skyscraper roof, with Roman lemon trees and the scent of jasmine in the air. When guests descend downstairs to their rooms, they find furniture made by craftsmen in Kyoto and look up at a coffered ceiling with five layers of gold painting in a Japanese style.“The hotel business often takes a pretty standardized approach to furniture and finishes,” Ursini said. “We use Italian residential furniture made by craftsmen and pieces by local workshops. Bulgari brings to the world the Italian art of living, be that in furniture or decor or cuisine.”In the eyes of some observers, the aesthetic needs to continue to evolve dynamically.“For me, a European based in London who visits Italy annually, I’m less drawn to Bulgari’s international portfolio for their Italian heritage than for the brand’s broader association with ultra-luxury,” O’Ceallaigh said. “So, for example, if I were at one of their hotels for a night, I’d skip their Italian restaurant in favor of whatever local option was available.”“Global consumers want to feel a really distinctive sense of place in the destinations they visit,” O’Ceallaigh said. “I’d hope to see more collaboration with — and greater representation and input from — local architects and designers to create a symbiosis that’s representative.”Bulgari’s related goal is to ensure that its hotels help keep its brand relevant for an emerging generation of travelers.“Too often, I see young people spend their whole trips watching their iPhones,” Ursini said. “But when you get to our Bali property on the edge of a cliff, you’re assaulted by the fragrances of flowers and the sound of the ocean crashing at least 180 meters below you. After you take your selfie, there’s a good chance you put your iPhone in your pocket and let the special moment absorb you.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 13.8% gain over the past four weeks.The upswing in share price came after IMAX announced that Illumination/Universal's The Super Mario Bros. Movie delivered the highest animated IMAX opening weekend of all time at the global box office with $21.6 million.The film scored the biggest IMAX opening ever for an animated film in North America with $16.6 million, and the company's top animated debut in 22 international markets around the world.This entertainment technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +200%. Revenues are expected to be $76.17 million, up 26.9% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Imax, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation.

VZ recently expanded the BlueJeans Partner Program in Latin America to help create more meaningful and inclusive experiences for local customers. In addition, it expanded the regional footprint of BlueJeans across Mexico, Peru, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic to offer an interoperable cloud-based video conferencing service across a wide range of devices and conferencing platforms.Verizon added CognosOnline, Directo and SISAP to its BlueJeans Partner Program in Latin America. While CognosOnline provides virtual education solutions, process automation and document management services, Directo operates as an independent B2B e-commerce pharmacy marketplace and SISAP provides advanced cybersecurity solutions. The engagement of the new channel partners will enable them to offer various video engagement solutions, including BlueJeans Meetings, BlueJeans Events with Studio, BlueJeans Rooms and the BlueJeans Gateway for Microsoft Teams.BlueJeans Meetings will enable local customers to collaborate from anywhere on any device for an immersive video conferencing meeting, while BlueJeans Events will facilitate firms to produce highly interactive and production-grade virtual events and live streams. BlueJeans Rooms integrates video conferencing systems with an easy-to-use, streamlined in-room experience.

With one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States, Verizon deploys the latest 4G LTE Advanced technologies to deliver faster peak data speeds and capacity for customers, driven by customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and constant strategic investment. The company remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures due to the expansion of 5G mmWave in new and existing markets, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and the continued deployment of the fiber infrastructure.Verizon’s 5G mobility service offers an unparalleled experience that impacts industries as diverse as public safety, health care, retail and sports. The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology. These are massive spectrum holdings, particularly in the millimeter-wave bands for faster data transfer, end-to-end deep fiber resources and the ability to deploy a large number of small cells. To expand coverage and improve connectivity, Verizon has acquired 161MHz of mid-band spectrum in the C-Band auction for a total consideration of $45.5 billion. These airwaves offer significant bandwidth with better propagation characteristics for optimum coverage in rural and urban areas.The stock has lost 27% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 8.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

(VZ) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-verizon-communications-inc-130001393.html,1681218001,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +7.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 7.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 points to a change of -9.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.78 indicates a change of +2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.78 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $137.48 billion and $139.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.5% and +1.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $35.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was -0.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It’s about to run into an earnings season that’s expected to deliver the biggest profit drop for the tech sector in more than a decade.Most Read from BloombergKatie Cotton, Guardian of the Apple Brand for 18 Years, DiesElizabeth Holmes Will Have to Wait Out Her Appeal in PrisonTwitter Company ‘No Longer Exists,’ Is Now Part of Musk’s XTumbling Money Supply Alarms Economists Who Foresaw InflationRich Chinese Splashing Out on Luxury Have Yet to Invest Big in SingaporeApple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other megacaps are almost single-handedly responsible for the S&amp;P 500’s 7% advance this year amid turmoil in the banking industry that’s caused investors to flock to perceived havens. With profits projected to drop 15% in the first quarter, investment professionals are bracing for a significant pullback if the behemoths fail to beat expectations.“Tech has been crushing it, but now we’re at an inflection point,” said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. “Earnings trends look dreadful and prices look too high. There’s a lot on my list of concerns, and if there’s suddenly a hiccup associated with guidance or the macro or whatever, these stocks could get crushed.”Apple, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc. are all up about 20% this year, beating the 19% rise for the Nasdaq 100. Nvidia Corp., Tesla Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc., are up even more — from 50% to 88%. JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka said the group looks overbought.The projected drop for tech earnings in the first quarter would be the biggest since 2009. Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 Index are seen down 8% for the period. The consensus has been consistently weakening: Six months ago, analysts in aggregate were expecting that tech-sector earnings would edge up by 1%.Expectations have been coming down for the biggest companies. The average estimate for Apple’s earnings in the quarter just ended has dropped by 4.4% over the past three months. There’s a similar trend at Microsoft, and for both, analysts are scaling back what they expect for the full year.Story continuesThe deteriorating view reflects a number of headwinds, including weaker economic growth, further Federal Reserve interest rate increases to combat inflation, and turmoil in the banking sector that threatens to curb corporate access to lending. However, one place these concerns aren’t being seen is in stock prices, where a rally has taken price-earnings multiples to elevated levels.Last quarter, 85% of tech companies in the S&amp;P 500 beat expectations in terms of earnings, compared with 69% of overall S&amp;P 500 components. Only 56% of tech stocks beat in terms of revenue, compared with 58% for the S&amp;P.The combination of falling estimates and rising prices means that valuations have gotten lofty, especially given that the International Monetary Fund’s outlook for global economic growth over the next five years is the weakest since 1990.Apple is trading at 26 times estimated earnings, above its 10-year average of 18. Microsoft is also at a premium to its long-term average, and both are above the 24 multiple of the Nasdaq 100, which itself is higher than its long-term average. The forward earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index, relative to the benchmark overall, recently hit its highest since 2005.“You really have to see earnings come through to justify this kind of valuation,” said Jeffrey Buchbinder, who oversees more than $1.1 trillion as chief equity strategist for LPL Financial. “Right now it’s a show-me story, and given how strong the run has been, misses will be punished. This is a valuation-driven rally, and those are the kinds of gains that can come out of a stock quickly.”Tech Chart of the DayNvidia has been a standout performer of 2023, surging 88% as the best-performing component of the Nasdaq 100 Index. The surge easily trounces the 19% advance of the index itself, as well as the 24% gain of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. Much of Nvidia’s advance has been related to interest in artificial intelligence technology.Top Tech StoriesApple Inc.

However, the company’s opioid-related litigation expenses pose a threat.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 1.3% so far this year against the industry’s 7.4% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has risen 7.4% in the same time frame.McKesson, with a market capitalization of $50.68 billion, is a healthcare services and information technology company. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 10.4% over the next five years.The company’s earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, the average surprise being 3.42%. Its earnings yield of 7.11% also compares favorably with the industry’s 4.73%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring MCK?McKesson continues to actively pursue deals, divestitures and acquisitions to drive growth. In April 2022, the company completed the divestiture of its retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom to Aurelius.During fiscal 2022, MCK completed the sale of its Austrian business to Quadrifolia management and the remaining share of its German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance. It is currently progressing with the divestiture of its European business. These divestitures will allow McKesson  to focus on its key growth market — the United States.In June 2022, the company formed a joint venture with HCA Healthcare HCA to create a fully integrated oncology research organization. Per the deal, McKesson and HCA will integrate their respective research units — U.S. Oncology Research (USOR) and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI).The newly created entity, with the combined capabilities of SCRI and USOR, is expected to boost clinical research, ramp up drug development, lead to better data and analytic capabilities, and pave the way for a wider portfolio of clinical trials. The abovementioned deal was completed in October.Story continuesMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses. It also stands to benefit from an increased generic utilization and inflation in generics, courtesy of an aging population and several patent expirations in the next few years.During the fiscal third quarter of 2023, McKesson’s growth was led by its strong performance across all segments, except the International segment, which was marred by unfavorable currency movement. The divestiture of the company’s Austrian business also hurt its growth.MCK removed a major overhang during the fiscal first quarter by signing a settlement deal related to the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. These developments will close the long-pending litigations that have been hurting the company’s goodwill, and also reduce its legal expenses.What’s Hurting the Stock?McKesson’s broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities is likely to drive the company’s expenses in the short term. The company had to pay up to approximately $7.4 billion to the Settling Governmental Entities, per the settlement deal.Estimates TrendFor fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $275.73 billion, indicating a 4.5% increase from the previous year.

(NYSE:TRV) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 84%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/travelers-companies-inc-nyse-trv-121512783.html,1681128912,STORY,['TRV'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Travelers Companies implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 12 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Travelers Companies. View our latest analysis for Travelers Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Travelers Companies?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Travelers Companies. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Travelers Companies' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Travelers Companies. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. With 8.7% and 8.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Travelers CompaniesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Travelers Companies, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$150m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Travelers Companies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Air Products and Chemicals with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How Fast Is Air Products and Chemicals Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Air Products and Chemicals has grown EPS by 5.9% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Air Products and Chemicals maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 18% to US$13b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Air Products and Chemicals.Story continuesAre Air Products and Chemicals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$63b company like Air Products and Chemicals. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$208m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Air Products and Chemicals To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Air Products and Chemicals is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Air Products and Chemicals has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

""You (Fox News) have a credibility problem.""Dominion Voting Systems alleges Fox damaged its business by knowingly and repeatedly airing false claims that Dominion voting machines were used to flip the 2020 election against former President Donald Trump, a Republican, and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden, who won.An attorney for Dominion, Justin Nelson, said his client only learned of Murdoch's role on Sunday and got its first document with Murdoch's title of Fox News executive chairman on Tuesday morning. Murdoch, chairman of Fox News parent company Fox Corp, is expected to testify in court.Dominion says that depositions by Murdoch and others, as well as troves of internal Fox communications, prove top network personnel knew the election-rigging claims were false but aired them anyway to appease Fox's conservative viewersFox News had disclaimed that Murdoch was a company officer, which shaped how Dominion litigated the case, according to Dominion attorney Nelson.

366,f2b3b4c5-d220-3bff-9ebd-c1b8f339437f,FOX,2023-04-12,Fox attorneys in libel case reveal dual roles for Murdoch,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dominion-discuss-general-threats-fox-194225334.html,1681242145,STORY,['FOXA'],"[WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Attorneys defending Fox in a defamation case related to false claims about the 2020 election withheld critical information about the role company founder Rupert Murdoch played at Fox News, a revelation that angered the judge when it came up at a Tuesday hearing.It was not clear whether the development would affect a trial scheduled to begin Thursday with jury selection. Dominion Voting Systems is suing Fox for $1.6 billion, saying it damaged its reputation by repeatedly airing false claims that the company helped orchestrate a fraud that cost former President Donald Trump re-election.The role of Fox executives is at the heart of the case. The company’s attorneys have sought to insulate members of the Murdoch family and to keep them from testifying live before a jury, arguing that their roles at the parent company, Fox Corp., put them at a distance from the Fox News shows that aired the bogus claims.Fox Corp. had asserted since Dominion filed its lawsuit in 2021 that Rupert Murdoch had no official role at Fox News. In its filings, it had listed Fox News officers as Suzanne Scott, Jay Wallace and Joe Dorrego. But on Easter Sunday, Fox disclosed to Dominion’s attorneys that Murdoch also is “executive chair” at Fox News. The disclosure came after Superior Court Judge Eric Davis wondered aloud during a status conference last week who Fox News’ officers were.Davis was clearly disturbed by the disclosure, coming on the eve of the trial.“My problem is that it has been represented to me more than once that he is not an officer,” the judge said.Davis suggested that had he known of Murdoch’s dual role at Fox Corp. and Fox News, he might have reached different conclusions in a summary judgment ruling he issued last month. In that ruling, the judge said there was no dispute that the statements aired by Fox were false, but that a jury would have to decide whether Fox News acted with actual malice and whether Fox Corp. directly participated in airing the statements.Story continuesTo Fox attorney Matthew Carter, Davis said: “You have a credibility problem.”In response, Carter said he believed Murdoch’s title at Fox News was only “honorific.”“I’m not mad at you,” the judge later told Carter. “I’m mad at the situation I’m in.”In a statement issued after Tuesday's pretrial hearing, Fox said, “Rupert Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman of Fox News in our SEC filings since 2019 and this filing was referenced by Dominion’s own attorney during his deposition.”It’s unclear whether the judge will take any action in response to the late disclosure. But an attorney for Dominion said he wanted Fox to further explain Murdoch's role with the network, indicating the issue could come up when the pretrial hearing continues Wednesday.Dominion attorney Justin Nelson told the judge the disclosure has “a big impact” on the case. He said Fox’s failure to disclose Murdoch’s status at Fox News has deprived Dominion of “a whole bunch” of information from Murdoch as a custodian of Fox News records that it was entitled to have.“It is something that really has impacted how we have litigated this case,” he said.Tuesday's development was the latest to turn an uncomfortable spotlight on the network.Information obtained by Dominion as part of its lawsuit has shown that some network hosts harbored off-camera doubts about election fraud claims but nevertheless allowed program guests to repeatedly make them in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The case also has drawn scrutiny of various emails and text messages shared among Rupert Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and Scott, the Fox News CEO, about election coverage and the allegations by Trump and his allies that he was cheated.They revealed a chorus of voices, from Rupert Murdoch and top network hosts to producers and publicists, who internally cast the election-stealing conspiracy claims as crazy even as the network repeatedly gave them a platform. Internal communications also showed that at the time, major players at Fox were deeply worried about retaining pro-Trump viewers.In a ruling earlier Tuesday, the judge denied a motion by Fox seeking to bar any reference at trial to matters involving the Murdoch family, which owns Fox Corp. The judge also said he would allow jurors to hear some testimony about threats directed at the voting machine company, but only to a point.The judge granted a motion by Fox to prohibit any reference to specific threats or harassment directed at Dominion, saying he did not want the jury to be prejudiced against Fox because of threats made by people with no connection to the network. But he said he would allow Dominion to talk generally about threats it had received to show how it has been damaged by the Fox broadcasts.“It has decimated Dominion’s ability to attract and retain employees, because the company is under siege,” said Megan Meier, an attorney for the voting machine company.The judge already decided last week there would be no testimony about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.]"

CHRW is benefiting from improved freight market conditions and shareholder-friendly initiatives. Notably, shares of C.H. Robinson have gained 1.7% over the past three months against the 0.1% loss of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHow is C.H. Robinson Placed?We are impressed with C.H. Robinson’s efforts to boost its shareholder value via dividend payouts and shares repurchases are commendable. C.H. Robinson rewarded its shareholders in 2022 through a combination of cash dividends ($285.32 million) and share repurchases ($1,488.28 million). Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.With improved freight market conditions, C.H. Robinson is benefiting from higher pricing and volumes across most of its service lines. In 2022, the top line improved 6.9% owing to higher pricing in truckload, less-than-truckload and ocean services. Solid segmental growth was also witnessed in 2022. In the North American Surface Transportation segment, total revenues were $15.82 billion (up 9.1% year over year) in 2022. Total revenues in the Global Forwarding segment in 2022 were $6.81 billion, up 1.2% year over year.On the flip side, an increase in operating expenses poses a threat to C.H. Robinson’s bottom line. In 2022, total operating costs increased 6.4% year over year. Costs are also likely to be high going forward.C.H. Robinson’s liquidity position is weak. CHRW exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $217.48 million compared with the long-term debt of $920.04 million. This implies that the company does not have sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, C.H.

Robinson Worldwide CHRW and Schneider National SNDR.Industry: Transportation ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2075334/3-transport-services-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe U.S. equity markets continue to be affected by extreme volatility. With inflation woes far from over, economic uncertainty is rampant.  High operating costs and supply-chain woes, too, act as major deterrents. All these factors are denting the prospects of stocks in the Zacks Transportation-Services industry.Nonetheless, we recommend keeping a close eye on three industry players, namely Expeditors International of Washington, C.H. Robinson Worldwide and Schneider National, which are better positioned to brave multiple industry challenges.About the IndustryThe companies housed in the Zacks Transportation-Services industry offer transporters logistics, leasing and maintenance services. Some industry players focus on the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding. Third-party logistics entities provide innovative supply-chain solutions. They also focus on services like product sourcing, warehousing and freight shipping. The companies have expertise in trucking, air and ocean transportation.Additionally, some players in this industry deliver domestic and international express delivery services. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy. An uptick in manufactured and retail goods, favorable pricing and improvement in global economic conditions bode well for the industry participants.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Transportation-Services IndustryEconomic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices in March, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The recent turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Story continuesSupply-Chain Disruptions &amp; High Costs: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Increased operating costs are also limiting bottom-line growth. The industry players are distressed by rising logistic expenses. The labor market has struggled with the limited availability of labor, which is driving-related expenses. Costs will likely continue to be steep due to supply-chain troubles.Strong Financial Returns for Shareholders: With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile by way of dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and confidence in business. Among the Transportation - Services industry players, Schneider National announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend in February.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Transportation - Services industry is a 26-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation  sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it in the bottom 24% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has decreased 25.1% on a year-over-year basis.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to consider, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Surpasses S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Zacks Transportation-Services industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 2.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 9.3% and the broader sector's decline of 7.6%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-sales, a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation-services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.72X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.57X. The value is, however, higher than the sector's trailing 12-month P/S of 1.54X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.33X, as low as 1.41X and at the median of 1.94X.3 Transport Services Stocks to WatchExpeditors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This Seattle, WA-based freight forwarder is being bolstered by strong air freight revenues. Efforts to reward its shareholders are commendable as well.Expeditors has an impressive earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark on the other occasion), the average beat being 5.69%. The stock has witnessed a 0.2% upward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings over the past 30 days.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  C.H. Robinson Worldwide, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, operates as an asset-light logistics player. Efforts to control costs bode well for this freight broker. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill further confidence in the stock.C.H. Robinson surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining ones), the average surprise being 7.64%.Schneider National, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, is being aided by strong performances in the Truckload and Intermodal segments. The Truckload segment is benefiting from Midwest Logistics Systems' revenues, effective yield management and dedicated new business growth.The Intermodal unit is being aided by a rise in revenue per order and brokerage volume growth. Efforts to reward its shareholders are commendable as well. SNDR's sound liquidity position is an added positive. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has moved 0.9% north.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

At this facility, Cummins plans to produce a fuel-agnostic internal combustion engine platform.Cummins will start manufacturing an essential piece of technology called electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen that will help decarbonize the U.S. economy. With the production of electrolyzer in Minnesota and investments in Indiana, North Carolina and New York facilities, Cummins has taken a dual-path approach and will work toward advancing engine-based and zero-emission solutions. The electrolyzer will produce hydrogen that can be used to power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and in the production of steel. Building an electrolyzer in Minnesota is a $10 million investment and an important step toward bringing the supply chain for zero-emissions vehicles to the United States.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the last week and six-month period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Next in the Auto Space?The first-quarter 2023 earnings season for the auto sector kicks off next week.

374,c8e9dafd-6e26-33e9-963c-fa00d0416d04,DIS,2023-04-12,New Florida board seeks power over Walt Disney World cities,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/florida-board-seeks-power-over-232851859.html,1681255731,STORY,['DIS'],"[By Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine(Reuters) - Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's newly formed oversight board is seeking to assert control over development in two cities where Walt Disney World Resort is located, the latest twist in a battle for authority over the company's Florida theme parks.A resolution, seen on Tuesday by Reuters, would give the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District board the power to review and evaluate development in the 25,000-square acres of property in and around Walt Disney Co's theme parks.The district would hold ""superior authority and control"" over planning, zoning and other land use in the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, under a Florida law that formed the state-appointed oversight board.Disney's major theme parks — The Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios and the Animal Kingdom — are within the city limits of Bay Lake, while the Disney Springs retail area sits in Lake Buena Vista. Some had speculated that Disney would use its influence over these two municipalities to maintain its autonomy over its resort.A hearing on the resolution is scheduled for April 19.A spokesperson for Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. A spokesperson for the oversight board referred inquiries to an attorney, who was not immediately available for comment.State Republicans last year targeted Disney after it publicly clashed with DeSantis, widely considered a 2024 presidential candidate, over a law that restricts classroom instruction of gender and sexual orientation.In a move that current Disney CEO Bob Iger called retaliation, Florida lawmakers passed legislation that ended Disney's virtual autonomy in developing 25,000 acres in central Florida where its theme parks are located.But before the takeover by DeSantis's appointees, Disney pushed through changes to the special tax district agreement that limit the board's action for decades.DeSantis has asked the Florida inspector general to investigate what he called ""collusive and self-dealing arrangements"" that aim to nullify recently passed legislation, and ""defy the will of Floridians"". He said the prior board’s actions appear to represent improper delegation of authority, among other violations.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Sonali Paul)]"

Even though price is a big issue for customers, quality of content remains the priority.

OKE is expected to gain from increasing pipeline volumes and fee-based commitments as production volumes rise. The company’s expansion efforts are also expected to strengthen its position in the high-production region and aid future earnings. ONEOK’s consistent dividend payment increases shareholders’ value.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company faces strong competition from other midstream providers.TailwindsONEOK continues to invest in organic growth projects to expand operations and provide a broad range of services to crude oil and natural gas producers, and end-use markets. Capital expenditures totaled $1,202.1 million in 2022, up from $696.9 million in 2021. The company expects total capital expenditures in the $1.27-$1.48 billion range in 2023. This indicates that systematic investments are necessary to keep up with the expected increase in producer activity.With production volumes resuming normalcy, ONEOK is poised to benefit from long-term fee-based commitments in all three segments. More than 90% of its 2022 earnings was fee-based and a substantial portion of its 2023 earnings is also expected to be the same. As production volumes continue to improve in its service areas, the company expects to perform better in the long run.HeadwindsThe natural gas and natural gas liquids pipeline industries are highly competitive. Apart from the existing pipeline companies, the midstream section recently saw many energy companies forming master limited partnerships to begin pipeline services. The partnerships’ assets are well spread out but ONEOK’s ability to withstand competitive challenges will depend on the efficiency, quality and reliability of the services it provides.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the same sector are Halliburton Company HAL, Liberty Energy LBRT and Cactus, Inc.

382,817dc245-ad75-3d8b-922e-b0d983324bc2,MTB,2023-04-12,M&T Bank Corporation (MTB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-corporation-mtb-140002580.html,1681135202,STORY,['MTB'],"[M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +50.2%.Revenues are expected to be $2.37 billion, up 64.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.59% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M&amp;T Bank Corporation?For M&amp;T Bank Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that M&amp;T Bank Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that M&amp;T Bank Corporation would post earnings of $4.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.57, delivering a surprise of +2.24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.M&amp;T Bank Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerWells Fargo (WFC), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +31.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $20.33 billion, up 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Wells Fargo has been revised 2.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 7.24%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Wells Fargo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, not all businesses plan to or are able to invest heavily in the space. Willingness to spend varies greatly, with 27% planning to spend below 20% of their IT budget on cloud and 33% planning to spend above 40% of their budget.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logoResults are based on a survey of 386 respondents across Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), Japan, China, India, Singapore, and South Korea. The survey was conducted to glean insights into partners' perspectives on IT budget priorities, and their customers' 2023 cloud strategy.""In our conversations with partners, we see that organizations are walking the fine line between investing in cloud as well as being frugal in light of the macroeconomic headwinds. We believe the solution lies in working with a developer-friendly cloud and compute ecosystem that can offer them both flexibility and cost-effectiveness, while avoiding bill shock,"" explained Tatsuya Suzuki, Regional VP, APJ Carrier and Channel, Akamai.

Additionally, Akamai has identified more than 50 cities globally in which it plans to begin rolling out distributed sites this year, bringing basic cloud computing capabilities into difficult-to-reach locations currently underserved by traditional cloud providers.Partners speak out on priorities for 2023 Most partners, including Wangsu, a China-based company that provides content delivery network and Internet data center services, are seeking a user-friendly public cloud solution, coupled with a transparent pricing structure.""With Akamai Connected Cloud, we really benefited from lower prices as a result of being able to reduce the cost of high outbound traffic. Equally important is that we have been able to save time while achieving our key objectives given the flexibility of the network pool and low traffic costs,"" shared Mingwei Zhang, Alliance Department Director, Wangsu, China.Meanwhile, security continues to be an overarching priority for partners, with the rise of data breaches in the past months.""In the coming months, we are likely to see an increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks and larger scale data breaches, causing more disruption. There is also a risk of complacency from breach fatigue.

AKAM recently published a survey report indicating that 95% of channel partners consider cloud technology a major component of their client’s 2023 strategy. Despite recognizing the need for cloud adoption, many enterprises remain cautious in their investment decisions. The study suggests the recent macroeconomic volatility, rising costs and balancing with other IT operational expenses are the main reasons behind the firms’ conservative behavior.The study sample comprised 386 respondents from several nations, including Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, India, China and Japan. Respondents from India, Vietnam and Indonesia expected that around 60% of the IT budget would be focused on the cloud. On the contrary, a significant portion of responders from Thailand, Japan and Taiwan opined that less than 20% of the IT budget would be devoted to cloud adoption.With the increasing digitalization of commercial activities, enterprises are witnessing rising consumer demand for various online services, resulting in higher data generation and information flow. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly challenging for enterprises to invest and expand IT infrastructure and provide optimum service with in-house computing.Akamai is looking to address these issues with its connected cloud, a user-friendly cloud solution with greater transparency, flexibility and an easy-to-use interface. With ever-changing workloads, cloud solutions will allow users to scale the resources according to requirements, thus nullifying the risk of over-investments and over-provisioning in data centers and ensuring better resource utilization. Cloud technology also enables developers to accelerate innovation and rapid deployment of applications, thus reducing the time to market.Along with its cloud technology, Akamai — with its advanced security solutions — is emphasizing on providing robust protection to its customers against sophisticated cyber-attacks. Akamai also plans to establish several cloud computing sites worldwide by the end of 2023 and intends to support underserved cloud developers with basic cloud infrastructure.Akamai is a leading provider of content delivery network (CDN) services, as its platform handles approximately two trillion web interactions daily. Its solutions help customers address the challenges of bandwidth constraints and Internet traffic while reducing the need for additional hardware to manage traffic loads. Software distribution is important in bolstering the business as the company benefits from rapid growth in Internet-based distribution of applications, operating system software and online game software.Cybersecurity is an area that holds a lot of promise for Akamai. With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, security has become a major concern for enterprises. Hackers are using new and sophisticated techniques to take advantage of the security loopholes of the cloud. Large enterprises are expected to increase their security budgets to address security concerns and instill confidence in cloud computing. Demand for Akamai’s security solutions will likely translate into significant growth opportunities over the long term.Shares of the company have lost 33.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 17.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAkamai currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Splunk Inc.

For more stocks, take a look at 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy Now. Last mile delivery is one of the hottest topics in retail right now and has big players such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) obsessing over it. If you don't know what last mile delivery is, don't fret since most people don't. Simply put, the concept refers to the final end of a good or product's journey from a warehouse.But wait. This is a post about edge computing, so what does last mile delivery, retail, or logistics have to do with it? Well, edge computing is the last mile of server computing. Traditionally, companies collect data from a wide variety of products to allow them to streamline their business operations. Before edge computing, this data was collected at the endpoint of a network, such as a smart vehicle, and then computed at data centers a considerable distance away. However, with edge computing, this data crunching is done closer to the source of data. According to computing firm Accenture, this improves both user experience when it comes to using the Internet of Things (IoT) or smart vehicles for consumers, and for companies that use robots, or other gadgets and electronic devices for their operations such as a smart kitchen.As should be obvious, storing and computing this data close to the source has several advantages. To illustrate these, consider the simplest example of edge computing. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone was the first mainstream smartphone to integrate facial recognition. This service stores a user's facial parameters on a device and uses these to authenticate identity. The iPhone is the perfect example of edge computing since storing the data close to the consumer ensures privacy and results in speedy results - two significant advantages of edge computing as a whole. In addition to privacy and speed, reducing costs is another benefit, since only aggregated analysis or outcomes are transferred to the central server, which reduces the need to invest in large data centers or frees up existing capacity from operations that are best performed on site.Story continuesHowever, in some cases, edge computing can also drive up costs. For instance, analysis from Edge Computing News shows that setting up data centers on the edge leads to higher costs since large hyperscale data centers can compute data more efficiently. Its analysis is based on a three year time horizon and factors in a variety of other considerations such as real estate, setup and cooling costs to outline that for this time period, on site or on premise cloud centers end up costing as much as 55% more than centralized hyper scale data centers. Yet, the report outlines that this does not completely rule out edge computing, as the platform is suited to large companies such as oil firms which have long time horizons and can derive significant benefits from computing data on site to benefit from the lower latencies and easy access.Building on this, these myriad benefits especially for crucial and valuable industries such as energy lead to optimistic valuations for the edge computing industry. A research report from Grand View Research outlines that the edge computing industry was worth $11.24 billion last year and it will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.9% from then until 2030, to be worth $156 billion by the end of the forecast period. The high double digit CAGR for this industry is among the highest that we have seen and surpasses that of other fast growing industries such as biotechnology. According to the research firm, edge computing was another sector that was boosted by the coronavirus pandemic as firms strived to grow their global footprint. At the same time, Grand View Research also adds that growth in edge computing will see a boost in the future, particularly due to the communications sector.Looking at what is happening in the industry right now, business is booming for firms that provide edge computing hardware. One such company is Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) which makes and sells networking switches that are the backbone of an edge network. The company's chief operating officer Mr. Anshul Sadana highlighted during its latest earnings call conference  shared:Our partnership with Microsoft and Meta grew even stronger last year. Both of these titans are in the midst of deploying our next-gen 100, 200 and 400-gig products at several key tails of their networks. The cloud is reshaping the Internet with their massive footprint, global backbone and edge partnerships. We are proud to have our products designed into pretty much all of these use cases. In addition, our business with the other titans continued to grow as well. We had additional design wins in backbone, WAN and edge folds. This past year, we ramped our 7800R3 series, high-density, 400-gig, near-lossless spine. We also introduced several new products based on Timeout 4 and our deep buffer virtual output care systems based on Jericho 2 to 7280 and the 7800R3 modular systems.Mr. Sadana was joined by the company's president and chief executive officer Mr. Jayshree Ullal who outlined:Considering this is only our third full year of shipping versus incumbents who have been in the market for 15 to 30 years, we are very proud of our execution. Our vision for a cognitive campus with network-as-a-service and edge-as-a-service based on NetDL is resonating extremely well and being embraced by our campus customers. We have also successfully deployed in many routing edge and peering use-cases, such as securing data in transit with TunnelSec encryption, precision and performance for mobile networks, cloud exchanges and metro Ethernet. Enterprise customers can now deploy EOS with a single EVPN protocol, whether it’s for data center, data center interconnect or WAN, delivering multiple profiles. Just in 2022 alone, we introduced 6 EOS software releases, 600 new features across 50 new platforms.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top edge computing stocks out of which the top picks are Cloudflare, Inc.

The upgrades will help firms better navigate extreme market conditions, providing a live view of risk across proprietary and client trading portfolios with detailed analytics to support real-time decision-making.The latest major release of the Nasdaq Risk Platform adds fixed income securities including Government Bonds, Corporate Bonds and Convertible Bonds to offer users a consolidated view of risk across a broad range of asset classes including Fixed Income, Equities and Equity Options, Exchange Traded Derivatives and Foreign Exchange. It also significantly enhances multi-factor and intraday stress testing tools that are capable of isolating and managing specific risks within large and complex scenario sets.“The extreme volatility in recent weeks has demonstrated the consequences of firms not understanding their intra-day liquidity and market risk. We’ve seen a significant increase in demand from banks and broker-dealers who recognize the importance of being able to distill, analyze, interpret, and act on signals in a genuinely live environment,” said Roland Chai, Executive Vice President and Head of Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq. “Our position as both a technology and markets infrastructure provider means that we are uniquely placed to help firms navigate these unprecedented headwinds.”Other significant enhancements include adding an open source distributed streaming system, Kafka, to feed live risk analytics, and fully incorporating Nasdaq Derivatives Pricing into the platform. Delivered via the Nasdaq Risk Platform or standalone, Nasdaq Derivatives Pricing provides streaming option analytics including theoretical prices, greeks and recalibrated option volatilities to clients. The integration enables firms to conduct P&amp;L, Value at Risk (VaR) and stress testing calculations on option portfolios which is done using recalibrated intraday volatility surfaces, a three-dimensional plot mapping option values against the possible strike prices of an underlying stock.Story continuesThe platform is a key growth area for of Nasdaq’s Marketplace Technology business, with the company increasing its customer base by 50% over the last 12 months.Timely Capabilities to Navigate a Volatile EnvironmentMagnus Haglind, Senior Vice President and Head of Products for Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq said: “Many firms still rely on receiving end-of-day pricing and margin calls, leaving them exposed to significant intraday volatility and the risk of a liquidity crunch.

Nasdaq Risk Platform provides firms with a consolidated and real-time view of risk across asset-classes, exchanges and CCPs and brings wider benefits in the form of more efficient collateral management, which can help unlock liquidity and boost returns.”Built in the cloud, and deployed via SaaS, the platform has the ability to scale rapidly at times of high market volatility.

Manufactured under the company’s State-of-the-Art Heterogeneous Integrated Packaging (SHIP) program, Intel delivered the prototypes six quarters before the deadline, demonstrating the company’s innovation strength and highlighting its dedication toward customers.Intel’s heterogeneous packaging technologies integrate embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (EMIB) with Intel Foveros technology, allowing DOD to rapidly identify, manufacture, test and induct state-of-the-art devices into operations. Intel’s EMIB technology’s simple design allows better flexibility and scalability and 3D Foveros technology provides greater performance with lower space utilization.Intel’s solution allows DoD to streamline its supply chain, support ongoing semiconductor research and development and protect its vital capabilities domestically. The microelectronics packaging technology will ensure that defensive systems are enhanced with a 10x advantage in size, weight, and power over any other product currently available in the industry, as per Intel estimates.Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor company and primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets, is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses — such as AI and autonomous driving. It is gaining rapid strides in the data center business with integrated solutions that are highly competitive in prices. The company is also focusing on developing a complete product range targeting different market segments. Healthy traction from Mobileye’s technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management are tailwinds.The drive to lower cost computing devices is increasing the pressure on servers taking the load off these devices. As more information in various structures and formats are increasingly stored in the cloud, there is demand for a new breed of chips that are more efficient in terms of cost and energy but may not pack in quite as much compute power as in the past. Intel has made advancements in this area and is now offering more integrated solutions that will likely be competitive on a cost-per-watt basis. The company’s investments in field programmable gate array (FPGA) to reduce latency and increase speeds are helping it develop custom solutions for big players.Shares of the company have lost 29.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s gain of 8.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Arista Networks, Inc.

This network refresh will make Oracle Park the first professional sports venue to be completely WiFi 6E-ready.WiFi 6E will improve the connectivity experience by enabling devices to download and upload data from the Internet faster and with lower latency. This means the Giants will be able to improve the fan experience inside the park to include benefits such as fast mobile ticket entry and mobile concessions while considering future innovations like AR/VR experiences and biometrics-based park entry. The 6GHz band adds a significant amount of new spectrum to provide a fast, reliable connection for devices throughout the ballpark.The installation at Oracle Park includes approximately 900 of Extreme’s WiFi 6E access points in a combination of overhead and under-seat placements that will provide strong network connectivity for both fans and back-of-house applications throughout the ballpark.The wireless network will be managed via the ExtremeCloudIQ toolset, providing Comcast Business and the Giants a single view into network performance across the park, enabling them to detect anomalies before they cause issues. Additionally, ExtremeAnalytics provides insights into network activity to pinpoint network issues and help improve performance; streamline operations such as identifying bottlenecks in venue foot traffic or determining when it’s necessary to redeploy resources at busy concession stands; and understand fan behavior and interests to help inform future commercial or marketing partnerships.""We are thrilled to build upon Oracle Park’s 20-year legacy as the first sports facility to bring free WiFi to our fans, with a new network that will serve the needs of our fans and staff well into the future,"" said Bill Schlough, SVP &amp; CIO for the San Francisco Giants. ""As we implement this new technology, we are also making sure that we install it in such a way that it can be easily upgraded so that as technology advances, we can continue to provide a best-in-class connected experience.""Story continuesAs gamedays increasingly incorporate technology-based offerings, a strong, future-ready network is critical to stadiums as they continually enhance their fan experience. Simultaneously, the increased reliance on tech-enabled services creates the need for more robust backend network operations. Operations staff for sports teams need a network that's easy to manage and scale.With ubiquitous WiFi coverage throughout the ballpark, fans will be able to reliably enjoy any number of connected experiences – whether sharing with friends on social media, finding their way around the ballpark via their mobile devices or ordering concessions online. Behind the scenes, the new network will provide improved reliability to power business functions like point-of-sale and ticketing, as well as the ability to rapidly deploy wireless infrastructure for temporary events on the field or outside the ballpark.""It is so important for ballparks like Oracle Park to be adaptable,"" said Scott Cohen, Executive Director of Strategic Wireless Solutions, Comcast Business. ""Fans attend Giants games for monumental moments and unforgettable experiences. Having a strong and adaptable network infrastructure is how these fans, and the vendors that serve them, achieve those unforgettable experiences. And, with these new network upgrades, the gameday experience at Oracle Park will be prepared for years to come.""Working with Comcast Business and Extreme Networks, the San Francisco Giants ensured that the new installation was long-lasting in the face of a fast-changing technology environment. The network backbone can keep up with demand and can go from 10 GB up to 100 GB with the flip of a switch. This adaptability means that as technology advances, Oracle Park can adjust its network without installing any new technology.John Brams, Vice President of Strategic Accounts at Extreme Networks said, ""The Giants are setting the bar of excellence when it comes to fan experience and overall operational efficiency. In this day and age, when fans come to the park, they expect the experience off the field to match what they see on the field. With the backbone of a high-bandwidth, high-performing, superhighway network, the Giants have laid the foundation for next-generation services like streaming and biometrics.""The installation is expected to be completed this month – April 2023.About Comcast BusinessComcast Business offers a suite of Connectivity, Communications, Networking, Cybersecurity, Wireless, and Managed Solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.

The expansion comes in the form of Comcast providing two new grants to The Arc totaling $710,000. The funding will allow The Arc to establish more Tech Coaching Centers at chapters across the country and offer The Arc@School special education advocacy curriculum to Spanish-speaking families. These programs have already helped over 3,500 people with IDD develop more independence, equity, and opportunities for their future.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230410005449/en/""Far too many people with IDD are left behind in our society,"" said Ruben Rodriguez, COO and Acting CEO of The Arc of the United States. ""A quality educational experience and understanding of technology is fundamental in creating equal opportunities of all kinds. These systems continue to deepen extraordinary disparities among people with IDD, especially underrepresented communities and low-income families. Our continued partnership with Comcast is making opportunity a reality for all people with IDD. It’s chiseling away at our society’s rampant inequities and helping everyone – no matter your disability – build bright futures.""A first grant of $560,000, will support The Arc’s Tech Coaching Centers at 10 locations across the country. It will also expand the training model to include caregivers and family members of people with IDD to ensure they can support in the implementation of technology across all environments, including assistive technology.With technology being an increasingly vital part of navigating and participating in today’s plugged-in world, including transportation, employment, recreation and social interaction, people with IDD face unique barriers to understanding and adopting digital tools, which are exacerbated by a higher rate of poverty and lower overall income. Since 2014, Comcast has supported The Arc’s Tech Coaching Center, reaching nearly 2,500 people with IDD through 19 chapters and giving them access to devices, services, and training that advance measured outcomes in employment, health, independent living, education, and interpersonal connections.Story continues""We know that digital skills training can open new doors to opportunity and help people living with disabilities gain independence,"" said Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation. ""That’s why we are proud to continue our long-standing partnership with The Arc to reach even more people with IDD – including their caregivers and families — and to create pathways that can help enrich their lives.""A second grant of $150,000 will go towards advancing efforts to help marginalized communities better advocate for their education. This investment will allow The Arc to fully translate the curriculum into Spanish to better meet this population’s needs and increase access to the content.Academic achievement and graduation rates for students with disabilities lag far behind their peers, trends marked by inordinate discrimination, suspensions, and isolation within school settings across the country. In 2016, The Arc created The Arc@School, an evidence-based, self-paced online training program designed to help families, educators, and advocates navigate the special education system. Since 2021, Comcast has partnered with The Arc to connect underserved communities to these educational advocacy resources. To date, more than 500 families of color and low-income households have been given free access to The Arc@School, in addition to a facilitation guide, Spanish language overview of the special education process, and cultural competency resources and sections.These grants were distributed through Project UP, Comcast’s $1 billion commitment to reach tens of millions of people in order to advance digital equity and help create a future of unlimited possibilities.About The Arc of the United States: The Arc advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), including Down syndrome, autism, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, cerebral palsy, and other diagnoses. The Arc has a network of nearly 600 chapters across the country promoting and protecting the human rights of people with IDD and actively supporting their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes and without regard to diagnosis.

Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Devon EnergyThe Executive VP &amp; COO Clay Gaspar made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1m worth of shares at a price of US$49.98 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$53.39. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the Devon Energy insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 47.21k shares worth US$2.4m. On the other hand they divested 28.20k shares, for US$1.9m. Overall, Devon Energy insiders were net buyers during the last year.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Devon Energy Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Devon Energy insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Overall, three insiders shelled out US$2.4m for shares in the company -- and none sold. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Devon EnergyI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Devon Energy insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$251m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Devon Energy Insiders?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Devon Energy insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. That's what I like to see! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share, indicating a change of -19.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -19.9%. This estimate has changed -5.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.88 indicates a change of +3.4% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.2%. The $17.19 billion and $17.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -10.3% and -0.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $4.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.66 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.5%. The EPS surprise was -5.14%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

407,46224c65-c62d-3acf-a791-89c50ca2161b,URI,2023-04-12,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights United Rentals and EMCOR Group,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-united-124812539.html,1681130892,STORY,"['URI', 'EME', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 10, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: United Rentals, Inc. URI and EMCOR Group, Inc. EME.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:2 Construction Stocks You Should Be Snapping UpAnalysts are divided on the outlook for the construction sector this year, although they tend to agree on some of the challenges and opportunities.Most agree, for example, that supply chain issues could continue to play up this year as well, with raw material costs escalating.They also think that skilled labor will still be hard to come by, partly because of the stigma attached to blue collar jobs. With the workforce continuing to retire early and not enough new talent taking their place, there's no easy way to fill the gap. By one estimate, the average age of construction workers is around 42.5 years right now. Therefore, there's much to be concerned about.Then, of course, we have persistent inflation exacerbated by higher oil prices. And if the Fed keeps raising rates, a recession becomes more likely. Higher rates are a double whammy for homebuilders because it not only puts further pressure on consumers but also has the effect of increasing mortgage rates that directly affect a person's ability to buy.A sticky supply chain, and uncertain raw material and fuel costs, push up project costs, and when demand is also under pressure, these costs are harder to pass on. Therefore, margins come under pressure.Where's the Money Then?While the supply constraints apply to the non-residential market just as much as they do to the residential side, demand-side pressures are entirely a different kind.The U.S. government is committed to infrastructure improvements, which makes this a relatively good year for civil and infrastructure work. This kind of work is also likely to generate more stable revenue and the projects are likely to be longer-term.Story continuesSome activity is also likely to move away from new construction to repair/rehabilitation projects. One trend that appears to be secular, for example, is the tendency to buy things online rather than in the malls. The declining traffic is making large commercial projects in brick-and-mortar shopping less and less viable, with many of them likely to be converted for other purposes. According to Wells Fargo's 2023 Construction Industry Forecast, based on a survey of current business conditions in the construction industry, there is ""cautious optimism"" among nonresidential contractors and distributors. The survey shows that while more than 50% of contractors expect to rent the same amount of heavy construction equipment in 2023, purchases will depend on the level of demand (more orders/backlog), and only if costs permit. Distributors, on the other hand, are renting the same or more equipment than a year ago with fleet utilization at 70%.However, the words of James Heron, national sales manager for the Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Construction Group, ""Despite a number of market variables, the level of optimism reflected in the 2023 forecast survey confirms industry leaders maintain a deep-seated belief in economic recovery."" Therefore, what happens in case of a recession remains a grey area, as may be expected.A ResearchAndMarkets report states that the industry will expand 6.1% this year and growth at a CAGR of 5.2% from 2023 through 2027. In addition to the housing weakness and other challenges mentioned above, the report mentions delays in hyper-scale data center construction projects in 2023 as a result of the economic impact on tech players. It expects government infrastructure building to support the market this year.Here are a few stocks worth buying today:United Rentals, Inc.United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,521 rental locations in the United States, Canada and Europe. Moreover, it operates in 49 states and every Canadian province. The company offers 4,600 classes of equipment for rent at a total original equipment cost (""OEC"") of $19.6 billion (as of December 2022).The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock with Value, Growth and Momentum Scores of A, B and A, respectively is expected to see 2023 revenue and earnings growth of 20.8% and 29.5%, respectively. 2024 revenue and earnings are expected to grow 4.0% and 9.1%. The 2023 estimate has increased 82 cents in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased 56 cents.EMCOR Group, Inc.EMCOR Group is one of the leading providers of mechanical and electrical construction, industrial and energy infrastructure, as well as building services for a diverse range of businesses.

It looks like Goldman Sachs writing in a note to clients that Micron, which already owns 22% of the DRAM market, should benefit from Samsung's cutback. And I would say that memory is probably one of the most cyclical parts of the economy. And that's why it's always a leading indicator, a bellwether, if you will, of what's going to happen with the general PC market and tech sales. So this is very important here.And it's usually very forward-looking. So we're talking about the market recovering in a couple of quarters here. In terms of the inflection point, that's usually when we see the stock turn up in anticipation of that. But hard landing? Recession? Maybe that's a monkey in the wrench.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, Jared. When you take a look at the analyst commentary on that, they were pretty encouraged by this. Citi out, which has a buy rating on Micron right now, saying that they actually now see a recovery in those chips the beginning of the second half of the year when it comes to what we could see in terms of financial performance here from Micron.KeyBank also similar, just in terms of the fact that this is really bolstering their confidence regarding some of the disciplined CapEx investments in memory that Micron has made. So Micron among the movers in today's action and certainly trending to the upside. We'll see whether or not that holds going forward.]"

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Mettler-Toledo basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Mettler-Toledo imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Mettler-ToledoFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this maker of precision instruments is expected to earn $44 per share, which is a change of 11% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Mettler-Toledo. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Mettler-Toledo to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Brands’ New Packaging Policy Has the Potential To Make a Global Impact,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-packaging-policy-potential-141500102.html,1681136100,STORY,['YUM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2023 / The World Bank estimates that 2 billion tons of waste is generated, from both businesses and residences, across the globe each year. As one of those companies, Yum! is looking to change this by leveraging the power of its 55,000 KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit Burger Grill restaurants to be part of the solution by reimagining its iconic packaging like the KFC bucket, Pizza Hut pizza boxes and Taco Bell sauce packets.In collaboration with parent company Yum!, each brand is shifting its existing packaging to more sustainable options. This includes transitioning away from plastics, while simultaneously developing packaging solutions - via a new policy - that sets sustainability standards for its restaurants and possibly influencing the industry to make broader change. Yum!'s new policy, led by increased investments in circularity, which is the creation of a product with the intent that it gets recycled and thus goes back into the supply chain, consists of the following three measures:The elimination of unnecessary packagingThe shift to more sustainable materialsThe support of better recycling systems and reusable products""It's our responsibility as the world's largest restaurant company to help solve for the amount of waste that ends up in landfills,"" said Jon Hixson, Yum! chief sustainability officer &amp; vice president of global government affairs. ""And for years, we've been diligently working on this challenge, and it's now been unified across the 150-plus countries and territories in which we operate, so that's what's really exciting.""While each brand is in a different stage in its sustainable packaging journey, they now have one cohesive blueprint to follow and can lean on each other while striving toward the same three goals. Here's how they plan to do just that.Eliminate unnecessary packaging and shifting to sustainable materialsUnrecoverable plastics are often found in wrappers, cup lids, cutlery and bags and are prevalent around the world due to their inexpensive cost and abundance in supply. But they can't be recycled, which makes them a key focus area in Yum!'s new policy.Story continuesAs companies move away from unrecoverable plastics, which most likely end up in landfills, there's an opportunity for them to build their reputation as sustainable stewards when it comes to packaging by shifting to more sustainable alternatives.""At Pizza Hut, we're lucky to be starting from a position of strength when it comes to plastics due to using primarily corrugated cardboard,"" explained James Watts, Pizza Hut global chief people &amp; Environmental, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) officer, adding that plastics in consumer-facing packaging have completely been eliminated from its restaurants in India and Brunei. Pizza Huts in New Zealand and Australia are close to the complete removal of consumer-facing plastics and are 95% and 90% plastic-free, respectively.""We remain focused on closing the gaps that exist around unnecessary plastics and have also started to explore how we can use our packaging as a way to educate customers on how to recycle them,"" Watts said.Pizza Hut's sister brands, KFC, Taco Bell and The Habit Burger Grill, are also in the process of removing unrecoverable plastics from their packaging.With 27,000 restaurants across 147 countries, KFC is taking ""a mindful approach"" when it comes to transitioning to more sustainable materials, according to KFC Global Director of Sustainability &amp; Packaging Susan Miles. Globally, the brand has moved from expanded polystyrene plastic (styrofoam) to more recyclable plastic or fiber-based containers for its side items and has purchased most of its paper-based packaging with fiber from responsibly managed forests and recycled sources.Also, several KFC markets have eliminated plastic straws, cutlery and bags. But, Miles said, that's just the start, and the brand is now looking to adopt additional practices developed in its individual markets, like a widely recyclable, plastic-free bucket in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Canada's compostable poutine bucket made of bamboo.""By using new materials and methods of making buckets, we are able to source a more sustainable alternative while staying true to our iconic bucket, which our customers know and love,"" Miles said.For its part, Taco Bell is rolling out recyclable wraps and bags for its burritos, tacos, Crunchwraps and more. And The Habit Burger Grill transitioned from plastic to-go bags to paper in 2022, eliminating 288,000 lbs. of plastic in the United States (U.S.). annually. The brand also sources more than 97% of its paper-based packaging from responsibly managed forests and recycled sources.""These are exciting changes for us because so much of our brand is tied to authenticity and living with purpose, just as our founders did,"" said The Habit Burger Grill Chief Operating Officer Iwona Alter. ""Creating a platform for packaging that is focused on sustainability ensures that we can continue to serve our guests delicious food that people trust.""Recycling and reusablesDespite Yum!'s best efforts, not everything in each brand's packaging suite can be eliminated or sustainably sourced. This is where the implementation of recycling programs is making a difference.In addition to converting consumer-facing packaging to recyclable, compostable or reusable materials, Taco Bell is also adding recycling and/or composting bins in its restaurants where infrastructure permits. Another important change happened when Taco Bell provided a recycling option for its sauce packets in the U.S., giving customers the ability to mail-in used sauce packets for recycling, thanks to a partnership with TerraCycle, a New Jersey-based company known for recycling hard-to-recycle materials.""The TerraCycle partnership is one that consumers are enthusiastic about,"" said Missy Schaaphok, Taco Bell director of Global Nutrition &amp; Sustainability. ""But the big unlock with this program is the fact that we've expanded it to include sauce packets of any kind and brand, not just Taco Bell's. At the same time, we're also exploring other ways to bring our fans the sauce they love, with less waste.""Pizza Hut also is focused on making its packaging, primarily made up of corrugated cardboard, more recyclable. Pizza boxes in Australia are made from 100% recycled content while that number is up to 70% in the U.K. At the same time, the brand is looking to educate consumers and work with groups that influence local governments and municipalities on the recyclability of its cardboard pizza boxes.What the future holdsWhile Yum! and its four brands remain committed to making a difference, challenges still exist as they must work around fragmented regulations worldwide surrounding packaging and sustainability.""There has been a lot of progress made, at the global level, in terms of creating a more sustainable ecosystem of products and operational efficiencies throughout our restaurant system. At Yum!, we're committed to good growth. We can't do that without a plan to preserve our planet,"" Hixson said. ""From our packaging initiatives to the work we're doing on forest stewardship and climate change, we are dedicated to making progress on our Recipe for Good.""Moving forward, Yum! and each of its distinctive brands have an eye on the future and are working toward their public commitments.For more information about Yum!'s Recipe for Good, click here.Yum!

The Ohio-based research firm taking a positive stance on the burger giant's recent cost cutting actions, saying that its recent restructuring will result in a streamlined business model that will help stores recover margins, despite cost inflation. Joining us now to discuss, Northcoast Restaurant research analyst Jim Sanderson. Jim, thanks for joining us, first and foremost here. Help us go further into some of the research here and what you're anticipating, especially as we're kind of tracking McDonald's share price reaction even on this report.JIM SANDERSON: Well, we're watching pretty closely the restructuring in place at McDonald's there. There have been headcount reduction announcements that are in process, but we really think what's coming out of that is a broader strategic restructuring, where you're going to have an organization in the US that is more streamlined, more centralized. And that's going to fit well with the new leadership that's coming on board.You've got a former Chipotle executive that will be joining McDonald's. I think she's just joined recently. She's got a great background in store development in the United States from Chipotle. And she also has that experience in looking at digital and technology applications to build the platform and to really improve the customer's accessibility to the brand. I think that's something that she will add to McDonald's, really leveraging a lot of the technology that McDonald's has developed.And they're in a stage now where they can grow. So I like the setup with respect to how the company is restructuring, the strategy they've got in mind. So they've got a new team and new team structure developed. And now they're bringing on new leadership that is really adept at technology and technology applications. I think that's exactly what restaurants in the United States need. And with McDonald's being a leader, I think this is a great way for them to enhance and strengthen their leadership position in the restaurant industry here in the US, which is still the most important market, even though they're pretty globally operating.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Right. Jim, it's Julie here. When we talk about the tech companies cutting staff, we talk about how bloated they got. Maybe they overestimated growth and hired too much. Is that what happened with McDonald's also?JIM SANDERSON: I think you've seen the actual dollar overhead expenses creep up a little bit after 2019. I think what we're expecting out of this restructuring is hopefully they're going to go back to a more stable dollar budget. And that will result-- as system sales grow, that will result in a lower percentage of revenue, let's say. So they're actually going to try to stabilize their budget for overhead and then focus on sales growth with a streamlined organization.So I don't necessarily want to say they've gotten got too fat per se, but I think that they are looking at what their business needs are currently and how they can adapt that and really get back to a position where you're starting to generate some leverage on that investment in overhead, not necessarily grow it to drive growth.And remember, McDonald's is coming off of an extensive multibillion dollar investment in their US store system. They've remodeled a significant number of stores. They're coming to the end of that. And I think that there's going to be a shift in strategy that, again, may not require the level of investment that we've seen in the past.BRAD SMITH: With this type of restructuring, what do you believe the prioritization coming out of it is for McDonald's? I mean, we're talking about reductions in compensation packages, title changes, demotions in some cases. That's no doubt a hit to some of the internal sentiment. Have we ever seen even a correlation of a company's performance even after they roll out some of these structural changes?JIM SANDERSON: Well, the cultural impact is something we want to be aware of and watch. So I think that's always a challenge in these transitions. When you do look historically, the last time there was a round of headcount reductions at McDonald's, again, you did see that nice stabilization of the dollar budget, and that allowed the sales to grow at a quicker pace than overhead expenditures. And that improved or strengthened the store margin race-- or excuse me, the corporate margin. So I think that was very constructive from a shareholder perspective.Again, what I like about the process here is the strategy behind it. So I think you do have cases where McDonald's has successfully restructured their employee base and come out of it stronger. And we're hoping that that will be exactly the same outcome this round, too.JULIE HYMAN: Jim, we always like to ask about buzzy products as well. And one of your colleagues at another bank was talking about the potential for the Chicken Big Mac and that there was some interest in that. What can you tell us about that? And how big of a catalyst maybe that will be for McDonald's?JIM SANDERSON: Well, the chicken sandwich and the chicken category is an incredible opportunity for any restaurant. It's a key driver. It's one of the top reasons a consumer goes to a quick serve restaurant, even if it's a burger restaurant. We're in a context now where we've got significant beef inflation that we know is coming down the road. So I think shifting it over to products that focus on chicken is smart.The cost of chicken, I think, will be far more reasonable than beef. We don't really anticipate that the inflationary pressures we expect in the beef category will be similar. And so in that context, it's smart to try to introduce products that really meet or hopefully build consumer demand and interest, but at the same time, can help operators franchisees improve their profitability. So I like the idea. Excited to taste it. Let's see what they come up with and how it works out, functions.BRAD SMITH: Jim, is McDonald's still the Nugget King? And if not, who is taking share or taking their lunch?JIM SANDERSON: No comment. I think that McDonald's innovated in the chicken category and whether they're the king in nuggets or whether they're bringing the consumer in, they had the launch of the chicken sandwich. The crispy chicken sandwich was pretty successful. So they've got lots of options. And I think that's the benefit for McDonald's right now, is keeping those options alive, so to speak, driving interest in the brand.I think we saw that most, in my opinion, with the adult Happy Meal. That wasn't necessarily a menu innovation, but it was the repackaging of some items. But it was amazing how effective that was in keeping the consumer interested in McDonald's as an option when they dine out. And I think that's what we're hoping for, any of these new menu innovations that are coming down the pipeline, in addition to the technology innovations that hopefully will make it easier for the consumer to access the brand in the US as well.JULIE HYMAN: Jim, thanks so much for your time this morning. Good to talk nuggets and everything else. Jim Sanderson--JIM SANDERSON: There you go.JULIE HYMAN: --Northcoast restaurant research analyst, thank you.JIM SANDERSON: You bet. Take care.]"

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.54 billion, down 2.27% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $10.49 per share and revenue of $24.27 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.86% and +4.67%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's.

Shares of MCD have gained 5.2% over the past three months compared with the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s growth of 3.4%.McDonald's reported impressive fourth-quarter 2022 results wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively.However, earnings estimates for 2023 have moved south to $10.49 per share from $10.53 over the past 60 days, depicting analysts' concern over MCD’s growth prospects. The company’s growth is being hurt by a softening economy and COVID-related woes in China along with inflation and macroeconomic risks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper and analyze the factors.TailwindsMcDonald’s is the world’s largest chain of fast-food restaurants, with presence in more than 100 countries. Its offerings have reached the billion-dollar brand status through sustained product innovation and geographic expansion.McDonald's is benefiting from its loyalty programs as these helped the company to transform its offerings across drive-thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in. The company has already introduced a loyalty program in more than 50 markets, including the United States, Germany, Canada, U.K., Australia and France, with almost 50 million loyalty users as of Dec 31 2022.MCD emphasizes on improving its chicken platform, including McNuggets, McChicken, McCrispy and McSpicy.  It believes that the strengthening of the core menu and solid marketing are likely to pave the path for additional growth in the upcoming periods.McDonald’s is consistently trying to improve its performance in the International Operated Markets, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. The company intends to drive comps growth in these markets through the introduction of value meals, customization of the menu to suit local customers’ tastes, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery and digitalized presence. With the rollout of self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service and the mobile app, customers now have more choices and flexibility as the company progresses toward its Experience of the Future initiative, which is based on adding technology to its eateries. The company reinstated the Performance and Customer Excellence program in 2022, after suspending it during the pandemic, in its 30 markets to enhance customer experience on a daily basis.Story continuesHeadwindsAlthough overall comps of MCD have increased sharply, it is still far behind the pre-pandemic level in a few markets, especially China. In fourth-quarter 2022, comps in the China market were negative. Softening economy and COVID-related government restrictions hurt comps in China.McDonald’s is grappling with difficulties like decelerating growth in Asia along with weakness in some parts of Europe, where the economic/political conditions are expected to be further challenging. During the second quarter of 2022, the company announced its exit from the Russian market owing to geopolitical tensions. Also, it cited concerns about a challenging operating environment due to rising inflation, a surge in COVID-19 cases and the return of government restrictions in many markets, which exacerbated labor shortages and supply chain challenges.MCD’s margins are hurt by persisting inflationary pressures. Margins in fourth-quarter 2022 suffered due to significant levels of food and energy inflation in Europe. The company stated that rising inflation levels are contributing to weak consumer sentiment worldwide and that the possibility of a global recession cannot be ruled out. The company expects to witness food and paper inflation in 2023 in mid-to-high single digits.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMCD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The report also reveals how review trends have shifted since 2020, when the previous edition of the report was published. Key trends include:Strong growth for reviews and business listingsThe report reveals a significant increase in the volume of reviews left on the platform during 2022 - up +20% from 2020 levels to 30.2 million - as the world's explorers returned in force following two years of lockdowns, and restrictions. During 2022, Tripadvisor also saw business owners respond to over 10 million reviews, while community members asked and answered more than 940,000 questions from fellow users.As global recovery continued in 2022, the platform saw an influx of new listings created, with 1.3 million new businesses added to the site, leading to a record 11.1 million listings at year end, up +16% from 2020's total of 9.6 million. Regionally, two out of five newly listed businesses were located in Europe, while Asia and North America each accounted for about 23% of the total.Success in combating fake and paid reviewsOnly a fraction of total review submissions from 2022 (4.4%) were determined to be fake or fraudulent, totaling just over 1.3 million. Of these, Tripadvisor's robust detection and moderation processes prevented 72% of submissions from ever making it onto the platform, a significant improvement on the 67% prevented during 2020.Story continuesReviews from paid review companies represent an even smaller proportion of fraudulently submitted content, but have the very real capability to negatively impact consumer trust. In total, Tripadvisor removed 24,521 reviews associated with paid review companies in 2022. Nearly half of these originated from just six countries: India, Russia, U.S., Türkiye, Italy, and Vietnam.Once fraudulent content has been identified and removed, Tripadvisor takes a range of actions against offending businesses, including content bans, ranking penalties and for the most severe cases, red badges. The Review Transparency Report reveals that Tripadvisor applied a ranking penalty to more than 33,000 businesses for fraud and issued 341 red badge warnings in 2022, each of these enforced with a ranking penalty.""Tripadvisor is built on trust, and we will never stop improving our systems to ensure our community has access to reliable content and the businesses listed can compete on a level playing field,"" said Becky Foley, Vice President, Trust &amp; Safety at Tripadvisor. ""The findings from this report show that our approach is working; we're catching a higher proportion of fraudulent content before it is published, with nearly three-quarters of fake reviews never even making it to the platform.""Progress in helping to keep travelers safeDuring 2022, almost 600 reviews were posted by Tripadvisor's community that described a serious safety incident during a travel or dining experience. Listings associated with these types of reviews, are subject to additional measures, aimed at increasing awareness among travelers.Tripadvisor is able to place additional filters on listings associated with reviews that contain warnings or serious allegations, helping users more easily identify potentially problematic businesses. And this approach is clearly working, with reviews that reveal a serious safety incident over 10 times as likely to be read, than reviews that do not.""I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to shine a light on the more troubling review content submitted by our community,"" added Becky Foley. ""Sharing details of distressing incidents requires courage and all those who have been brave enough to share their experiences will hopefully take heart from the fact that their reviews are being seen by others and are making a real-world difference.""The 2023 Tripadvisor Review Transparency report can be viewed in full at this link: http://tripadvisor.com/TransparencyReport2023About TripadvisorTripadvisor, the world's largest travel guidance platform*, helps hundreds of millions of people each month** become better travelers, from planning to booking to taking a trip.

In that same time, the Transportation sector lost 3.15%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.13%.United Parcel Service will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 25, 2023.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $22.97 billion, down 5.78% from the year-ago period.UPS's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $11.49 per share and revenue of $97.67 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -11.21% and -2.66%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.13.Also, we should mention that UPS has a PEG ratio of 2.26.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. United Parcel Service (UPS) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.52 a share 15 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 25, 2023.UPS has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.48%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.52 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35.UPS is one of just a large database of Transportation stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Canadian National (CNI).Slated to report earnings on April 24, 2023, Canadian National holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.26 a share 14 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Canadian National is $1.23, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.67%.Story continuesUPS and CNI's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

449,0f3e4ba1-229b-3cf3-9a19-7eeb0789bf9b,AXP,2023-04-12,American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 65% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-company-nyse-axp-130017618.html,1681218017,STORY,['AXP'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies American Express' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 13 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about American Express. Check out our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that American Express does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see American Express' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 20% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.1% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of American Express Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$162m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in American Express. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 20% of the American Express shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

This company, which is in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This retailer for farmers and ranchers has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2.16%.For the most recent quarter, Tractor Supply was expected to post earnings of $2.34 per share, but it reported $2.43 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.85%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.09 per share, while it actually produced $2.10 per share, a surprise of 0.48%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Tractor Supply, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Tractor Supply currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.98%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 27, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Conagra Brands has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Mondelez has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CAG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CAG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.27, while MDLZ has a forward P/E of 22.48. We also note that CAG has a PEG ratio of 2.29. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MDLZ currently has a PEG ratio of 3.15.Another notable valuation metric for CAG is its P/B ratio of 2.05. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MDLZ has a P/B of 3.61.Based on these metrics and many more, CAG holds a Value grade of B, while MDLZ has a Value grade of C.Story continuesCAG stands above MDLZ thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CAG is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts.On April 7, the Wall Street Journal reported that oil giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a potential acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin. Shares of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) surged by roughly 6%, on April 10, during trading hours.""There's So Much Money To Be Made Here""On April 11 Gilman Hill Asset Management's CEO, Jenny Harrington, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she discussed the potential acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) and her view on the energy sector. Jenny Harrington sees the potential acquisition as an opportunity for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to invest its significant cash reserves in one of the major oil assets available in the Permian Basin. She believes this move could put a floor under not only Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), but also other companies with Permian assets such as Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY). Harrington noted that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has 70% of its assets in the Permian Basin and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) has approximately 55% of its assets in the Permian Basin.Jenny Harrington suggests that investors should look at these companies based on their cash flow, and highlights the significant amount of ""money to be made"" in the energy sector. Jenny Harrington talked about the volatility in energy stocks and noted that even when energy stocks fall, she thinks that ""when the stocks come down to these trough kind of levels, they're really compelling to buy"". Here are some comments from Jenny Harrington:Story continues""Whether we like it or not, we are totally dependent on fossil fuels, and those are here and we need them. You see things like U.S. gasoline demand decreasing, it's easy to latch on to that and say ""oh everyone's running for EVs, who's gonna need gasoline anymore?"". But when you take a step back and look at the broader global scale you actually see expectation for global demand of oil increasing over the next 5 years. So this really is just a great reminder of how much money there is still to be made in this space.""Further, Jenny Harrington noted that she bought Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) within the last year, as she believes the Permian Basin holds the best global assets and future growth opportunities. She said that she concentrated her focus in the Permian Basin, and expects it to be the source of the best free cash flow.Some of the best energy stocks to invest in right now according to Wall Street analysts include Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”10.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”9. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Average Analyst Price Target as of April 11: $69.01Average Upside Potential as of April 11: 13.35%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was held by 40 hedge funds at the close of Q4 2022.

We did so by trimming our position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a stock we added to the portfolio in Q1 2022. As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature. As the largest LNG supplier in the world, we believe Shell is particularly well-positioned to help Europe meet its energy needs as it looks for ways to replace imported Russian oil and gas with new sources after the embargo.”8.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”In addition to Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD), other energy stocks that Wall Street analysts see promising upside to include Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts. Suggested articles:10 Best EV Battery Stocks Under $1013 Best Emerging Market Stocks to Buy12 Cheap Utility Stocks to Buy According to AnalystsDisclosure: None. 12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

460,40ee605e-c1ee-3f70-9bc4-c96071ee5344,OXY,2023-04-12,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-trending-130001822.html,1681218001,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +8.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share, indicating a change of -35.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.79 points to a change of -38.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.08 indicates a change of +5% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $31.35 billion and $31.25 billion estimates indicate -15.5% and -0.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $8.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.61 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.95%. The EPS surprise was -12.02%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As news of the COVID-19 pandemic spread and worldwide governments responded with lockdowns, crude oil futures briefly flushed to negative prices.However, as countries began to reopen and pandemic-related stimulus dollars flooded the economy, oil prices rebounded and never looked back. USO shot higher from a low of $16.88 to $70 today. Despite the impressive multi-year move, prices have been stagnant over the last six months, with USO falling nearly 5%.Several factors have contributed to the rise in prices and the subsequent stagnation. Has the oil sector topped, or is it simply taking a breather? I believe the former. Below are five reasons why the oil industry will thrive over the next year:Potential M&amp;A Activity: Over the holiday-extended weekend, news broke that Exxon Mobil, the world's third-largest oil company, was in talks to purchase $49 billion fracking behemoth Pioneer Resources. While nothing has been confirmed yet, the news is a bullish signal for the industry. The fact that XOM is even contemplating such a large purchase underscores confidence in the company's financial position. It also shows that the company is willing to bet on the industry's future.Growth at a Reasonable Price: Currently, most energy companies are growing their bottom lines at a robust double-digit pace, including industry leaders such as Chevron and British Petroleum.Despite the rapid growth, valuations remain attractive across the board. So much so that the most famous and successful value investor, Warren Buffett, has been accumulating shares of Occidental Petroleum hand over fist. Thus, the fact that the oil industry is attractive from both a growth and valuation perspective should put a bid under prices for the foreseeable future – especially since both are hard to come by in the current environment.Story continuesSupply Issues: If you've taken (and passed) an Econ 101 class, you know that the balance between supply and demand is at the heart of economics. Last week, OPEC unexpectedly slashed crude oil production by 500,000 barrels per day. While crude oil shot higher in response, it will likely take investors time to adjust to the new constraints. Furthermore, geopolitical issues persist. The war in Ukraine drags on with no end in sight, and instability in the Middle East, such as the civil war in Yemen, continues to disrupt oil production. Any escalations between Taiwan and China would further this phenomenon and boost oil prices ever higher. Long-Term Technical Picture is Bright: Amateur investors often construe the practice of technical analysis with short-term price movements. While technical analysis can be used in such a manner, a long-term technical view does the best job of smoothing out the big picture and providing the most transparent picture. Using USO as an oil proxy, the 200-week moving average has been a reliable indicator for investors to monitor when it comes to oil.For example, pre-pandemic in 2020, USO broke below the 200-week moving average at $95 and didn't bottom until $16. Then, USO broke back above the moving average at ~$30 and didn't top until $94. In other words, by simply plotting and adhering to this indicator on a chart, investors could have been on the right side of the oil trend over the past three years.Following the OPEC production cut news last week, USO broke back above the 200-week line on massive volume equating to more than double the norm – indicating solid demand.Finally, there's an old saying that ""From false moves come fast moves."" USO undercut the past six months of price congestion before reversing higher on the OPEC news. As prices flushed below obvious support levels, ill-advised shorts likely piled into the market. Now that prices have regained key support, the ""bear trap"" may act as even more fuel for oil prices moving forward.Stuck between a rock and a hard place: The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at its lowest levels since 1984. In October, the Department of Energy provided an update via the White House Website, which read, ""DOE (Department of Energy) plans to use this authority to enter contracts to repurchase oil for the SPR, targeting a price of about $67 to $72 per barrel or lower..."".When crude oil finally dropped to the ""target"" area, the DOE did not make the purchase, and OPEC backed the U.S. DOE further into a corner by cutting production levels. If oil is to drop back down in the coming months, the odds favor an outcome where the DOE will try to take advantage – putting an artificial floor below prices.Bottom Line Market factors such as supply constraints, geopolitical tensions, and strong price and volume action should act as a confidence booster for prospective oil investors. Furthermore, the historically low levels in the SPR mixed with OPEC's aggressive supply stance should act as a price floor in the months ahead.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This led to dismal fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both metrics declined year over year.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the adjusted loss of 75 cents compared unfavorably with a loss of 2 cents reported in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. Net sales declined 6% year over year to $4,243 million. The metric decreased 19% from the pre-pandemic level. Comparable sales (comps) fell 5% on a year-over-year basis.  The adjusted gross margin of 35% contracted 480 basis points (bps) year over year due to a 430-bps decline in adjusted merchandise margins, stemming from huge discounts and inflationary headwinds. The adjusted operating loss was $6 million in the reported quarter, excluding impairment charges related to inventory, $35 million in costs related to the transition of Old Navy Mexico, and an $83-million gain on sale related to a UK distribution center.Consequently, management expects first-quarter fiscal 2023 sales to decline in the mid-single-digit range, whereas the prior-year quarter’s reported figure was $3.5 billion. For fiscal 2023, net sales are anticipated to decrease in the low to mid-single-digit range, whereas our estimate is pegged at a 4.6% decline. This might be due to the continued uncertain consumer environment and higher promotions. Also, rising prices of essential commodities are likely to continue to hurt lower-income consumers' spending on non-essentials like apparel. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of GPS have lost 25.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 12.1% growth.Brighter Side of the StoryHowever, the company has been banking on its Athleta brand, which has been serving as a key catalyst for long. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales. Although net sales fell 1% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 for the Athleta brand, the metric grew 51% from the pre-pandemic level.Segmental results gained from continued share gains. Increased focus on performance active and active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends bodes well. It has also emerged as one of the fastest-growing women's athleisure brands in North America. Driven by these factors, Athleta has been on track to reach $2 billion in net sales by fiscal 2023.Gap is on track with its aggressive cost-management actions. The company has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure, including increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands.These actions are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, of which half is expected to be realized in the latter half of fiscal 2023.Apart from these efforts, the company is expected to realize $250 million in annualized savings, as announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Over the last six months, it identified $550 million in annualized savings in total. Gap revealed plans to further optimize its marketing spend and rationalize its technology investments over the next few years.The company’s Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly-profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, bodes well. As part of the plan, it expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute 70% to sales by 2023. As part of its 350-store closure plan, the company expects to close 50-55 Gap and Banana Republic stores this year. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023.The company expects to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations. It anticipates the e-commerce business to contribute 50% of sales by the end of 2023. Through the plan, the company expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and strong operating cash flow.Story continuesWrapping UpAlthough inflation-led sluggish demand is a concern, Gap looks well-placed for further growth on the back of its Athleta brand, cost-saving efforts and Power Plan 2023. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% raise optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked stocks you may want to consider, Urban Outfitters URBN, DICK’S Sporting Goods DKS and Ulta Beauty ULTA.Urban Outfitters, a leading lifestyle product and services company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

So we're seeing wellness stick, and we're also seeing [consumers] really lean in a little bit more to cosmetics, which is great.""According to Susan Anderson, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, Ulta's strength can be attributed to the strength of the category overall as well as factors specific to the retailer, such as its rewards program, omnichannel presence, and range of products and services across mass and prestige cosmetics, skincare, and wellness.The beauty category has ""continued to be strong into this year,"" Anderson told Yahoo Finance Live following her bullish Buy rating on Ulta stock. ""I think that's only going to benefit Ulta.""""We also see them as a share gainer despite the higher growth category,"" added Anderson, who has a $622 price target on the stock. ""We see them taking share from department stores, particularly as they roll out their prestige business further and then also add luxury such as Dior to their lineup of brands that they sell in the store.""Even as Ulta makes a push into more luxury segments, Steelman noted that the retailer is still attracting a broad range of consumers.""What we're really pleased that we see is that the consumer across all income sectors is spending at a great pace,"" the COO said. ""There's not one income sector that's outperforming another. So it's very consistent across the spectrum, and I think part of that is because we do offer everything in one place across all price points.""Story continuesThe shelves at an Ulta Beauty store.

""This approval enables us to advance closer toward our goal of developing medicines for people of all ages living with CF.""""As a trial investigator, I have seen the benefit ORKAMBI can bring to children ages 1-2 living with cystic fibrosis,"" said Larry C. Lands, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, Pediatric Cystic Fibrosis Clinic, and Pediatric Pulmonary Function Laboratory, Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University Health Center, and Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University. ""This approval is a great step towards initiating eligible patients earlier to potentially slow the progression of the disease.""This approved label expansion is based on data from a 24-week, Phase 3, open-label, multi-center study in 46 children ages 1 to less than 2 years who have two copies of the F508del mutation. ORKAMBI® was generally well tolerated, and the safety profile and pharmacokinetics were similar to that observed in studies in patients ages 2 years and older.Vertex will work closely with payers to secure access for this new patient population as soon as possible.Story continuesPrORKAMBI® was previously approved by Health Canada for use in people with CF ages 2 years and older with two copies of the F508del mutation.About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 88,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About PrORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor)In people with two copies of the F508del mutation, the CFTR protein is not processed and trafficked normally within the cell, resulting in little to no CFTR protein at the cell surface.ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) is an oral medicine that is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Lumacaftor is designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the F508del-CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of lumacaftor and ivacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF.

(NYSE:TXT) Suggests It's 31% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-textron-inc-nyse-195451409.html,1681242891,STORY,['TXT'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Textron is US$99.48 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityTextron's US$68.40 share price signals that it might be 31% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 20% higher than Textron's analyst price target of US$83.19In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Textron What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$955.3mUS$990.3mUS$1.06bUS$1.06bUS$1.15bUS$1.19bUS$1.23bUS$1.27bUS$1.30bUS$1.33bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 3.75%Est @ 3.25%Est @ 2.89%Est @ 2.65%Est @ 2.47% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$889US$858US$856US$797US$804US$777US$747US$715US$684US$652(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.8bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.1%) = US$25bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$12bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$68.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Textron as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.898. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TextronStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.35. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.68.

485,3106c3bc-8a7d-343d-a0d4-52aadec2a9f0,KO,2023-04-12,Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) investors will be pleased with their favorable 64% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-colas-nyse-ko-investors-110034119.html,1681210834,STORY,['KO'],"[The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) share price is up 40% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. But if you include dividends then the return is market-beating. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 1.8% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 50% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Coca-Cola's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Coca-Cola's TSR for the last 5 years was 64%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Coca-Cola shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.2% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 10% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you should know about.But note: Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy.

This comes as investors are increasingly concerned about the environmental, social, and governance aspects of the companies they put their money behind. Thus, many companies have seized the opportunity to project the best possible image, to increase demand for their shares.The environmental portion of that trifecta has become especially important, with many firms opting to project greener images. Naturally, some of these firms exaggerated the truth regarding their efforts as environmental champions.High-profile scandals ensued, with companies like Volkswagen (VWAGY:OTCMKTS) being caught committing outright fraud. The companies listed below may not have acted as egregiously. However, these are companies that will likely face increasing scrutiny as the pendulum swings toward true sustainability long-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHNNMYHennes Mauritz$2.86KOCoca-Cola$62.84SBUXStarbucks$104.68Hennes Mauritz (HNNMY)A hand reaches for an article of clothing on a hanger from a rack labeled XL.Source: christinarosepix / Shutterstock.comHennes Mauritz (OTCMKTS:HNNMY) isn’t likely to mean anything to readers at first blush. It isn’t a household name to be sure. But it’ll become more apparent when I tell you that Hennes Mauritz is better known as H&amp;M.H&amp;M is one of a group of clothing retailers broadly referred to as fast fashion brands. There are several reasons to avoid these companies and their stocks, if greenwashing and ESG is among your primary concerns.For one, fast fashion brands are known to make lower-quality clothing that doesn’t last long. It’s cheaper, but at a cost to the environment. The short lifespan of this clothing means that the textiles turn into waste much quicker. Hennes Mauritz doesn’t necessarily advertise its fast fashion as environmentally friendly. But it did market a ‘green’ line of clothing under the name ‘conscious’ at one point. The catch is that those are simply marketing buzzwords, lacking legal definitions.Story continuesEven if H&amp;M and other fast fashion brands don’t actively market their green initiatives, they will likely face increased scrutiny, due to the speed at which their garments become trash.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comI’ll be clear: I generally favor Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock as an investment. The company’s ability to maintain a steady share price throughout all stages of the business cycle is advantageous to long-term investors. Additionally, KO stock is an outstanding option for investors seeking income, considering the company’s dividend growth profile historically. Those factors make Coca-Cola a buy in this age of volatility and recession concerns.However, at the same time, I have to admit that Coca-Cola isn’t an environmentally-friendly company. Unsurprisingly, Coca-Cola’s plastic bottles used in its wide swath of products creates a tremendous amount of plastic waste globally. Thus, it might not be surprising to discover that Coca-Cola has been named the worst plastic polluter for the fifth straight year in 2022.Coca-Cola is focused on making its plastic packaging more recyclable. Currently, 90% of its packaging is recyclable, with a goal of 100% by 2025. But only 61% of the bottles and cans it put into the market in 2021 were reused or collected for recycling. Thus, 39% of that packaging immediately became waste. And of that 61% that gets recycled, how much was actually reused?Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock faces many of the same ESG issues that plague Coca-Cola. Both companies create massive amounts of waste, while being highly-successful beverage companies.In 2018, Starbucks banned single-use plastic straws in favor of straw-less lids. The lid used more plastic but was recyclable, unlike the straws. Predictably, consumers pointed out that those lids wouldn’t necessarily be recycled. Thus, environmental advocates claimed Starbucks was making the problem worse by failing to consider the decision thoroughly.More recently, Starbucks committed to eliminating PFAS from its U.S. packaging in 2022 and internationally by 2023. PFAS chemicals do not break down in the environment, and have been linked to several health problems.Ultimately, eliminating PFAS chemicals from packaging is a good thing. Starbucks is doing the right thing. But it still creates significant amounts of plastic waste and paper, too. Its paper cups are only recyclable in 4 U.S. cities due to their plastic lining. That’s not good for the environment, or for investors looking to hone in on Starbucks as an ESG option.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The launch aims at transforming email marketing for small and mid-size businesses.The solution is developed using Intuit Mailchimp’s existing generative AI tools and the company’s AI-driven expert platform. It is designed to help customers create email marketing campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice.Intuit’s Email Content Generator solution uses OpenAI’s GPT technology to aid marketers quickly generate content on brand marketing, get copy ideas and inspiration and test variants to offer better personalized and engaging email marketing campaigns to clients.According to Rania Succar, Mailchimp’s CEO, ""AI and text generation tools like ChatGPT have received a lot of attention recently, and for good reason. We see this as a supportive technology for marketers, and we want to provide them with approachable ways to use AI so that they can automate, generate, and optimize content to save time and trust that what we’re serving them is tailored to help them reach their goals.""Intuit Inc. Price and ConsensusIntuit Inc. Price and ConsensusIntuit Inc. price-consensus-chart | Intuit Inc. QuoteThe newly released Intuit tool breaks down why an email marketing campaign performed the way it did, with detailed insights and suggestions. It also shares recommendations for improving those campaigns and content.The Email Content Generator features Send Day and Send Time Optimization that takes a date range for a campaign, within Intuit’s Campaign Manager, and recommends the best day to send an email. It also adjusts the send time of an email to the predicted optimal time of the day of promoting an email campaign.The solution has a content optimizer option that offers guidance with analysis, based on industry best practices for readability and skim ability, calls to action, imagery, tone, errors in link formatting, merge tags, spelling and grammar. Its creative assistant feature imports marketers’ brand assets and houses them in a brand kit. These assets are later on used to populate their marketing with auto-generated designs that include brand colors, fonts, logos and images.Story continuesSome other functionalities of the Intuit Mailchimp Email Content Generator are purchase likelihood and customer lifetime value, customer journey builder, next action recommendations, stock image suggestion, campaign performance benchmarking and product recommendations. The solution is currently available for selected Mailchimp customers in the United States under Standard and Premium plans.INTU is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run.In March, the company unveiled Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Index — a powerful monthly indicator of employment and hiring among small businesses in Canada, the United States and the UK. The index utilizes purpose-built economic models to normalize anonymized QuickBooks Online Payroll customer records against official government statistics.In January, the company increased the availability of its QuickBooks Business Network solution among millions of small and mid-market businesses in the United States. This was done to enable eligible QuickBooks Online customers in the United States to easily connect with each other in the business-to-business (B2B) network.The idea was to accelerate B2B payments, leverage automation for simplification and streamlining of administrative tasks, and get access to better collaboration and connection possibilities.In December 2022, Intuit entered into an agreement to acquire financial health startup SeedFi. This is likely to enable INTU to accelerate and upscale its Credit Karma business members’ financial progress through SeedFi’s Credit Builder technology.However, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small business operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth in the near term. Higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting the bottom line in the near term.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderIntuit currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The S&amp;P 500 composite index has gained 14.5% in the same time frame. With a market capitalization of $6.1 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.9 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowing revenues, active expansion endeavors and a strong financial position continue to drive Encompass Health.Return-on-equity (ROE) of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) inpatient rehabilitation hospital operator stands at 16.2% as of Dec 31, 2022, higher than the industry average of 5.3%. This underlines EHC’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Can EHC Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Encompass Health’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $3.07 per share, indicating a 7.7% increase from the prior-year reported figure.  The consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $3.50 per share, suggesting a 14% growth from the 2023 estimate.The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 14%, better than the industry’s average of 12.6%.Revenues of Encompass Health continue to benefit from solid contributions from its Inpatient Rehabilitation segment, which in turn, is driven by growing patient volumes and favorable pricing. Management anticipates revenues to lie within $4,680-$4,760 million, the mid-point of which indicates 8.5% growth from the 2022 figure.  It aims to achieve long-term revenue growth of 8% to 10% over the 2020-2025 period.Solid demand for the rehabilitative care services of Encompass Health is likely to continue, considering an aging U.S. population and the importance of such services that enable patients to resume their daily activities after an injury, illness or surgery.In order to capitalize on the robust demand for its services, EHC remains quite active with expansion endeavors. Through these initiatives, the healthcare provider unveils plans to set up inpatient rehabilitation hospitals to reach areas grappling with inadequate care access and inaugurate the same within a reasonable timeline.Presently, Encompass Health operates 156 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals located across 37 states and Puerto Rico. This year, it targets to open eight hospitals. The expansion initiatives of EHC also come in the form of increasing the bed count of its existing facilities. It aims to add 80-100 beds to its existing facilities in 2023.The financial position of a company like Encompass Health needs to be very strong in order to handle such uninterrupted growth investments. Case in point, it boasts a sound cash balance and solid cash-generating abilities. A source of additional liquidity in the form of a $1 billion revolving credit facility, out of which $912 million remained for borrowing as of Dec 31, 2022, also bodes well.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks in the Medical space are Henry Schein, Inc.

494,09459294-8a67-3695-ad5e-b1eda9486954,SYK,2023-04-12,Stryker (SYK) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stryker-syk-great-momentum-stock-160004042.html,1681228804,STORY,['SYK'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Stryker (SYK), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Stryker currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SYK that show why this medical device maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor SYK, shares are up 0.77% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Products industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.07% compares favorably with the industry's 0.76% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Stryker have increased 10.94% over the past quarter, and have gained 9.46% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 5.29% and -7%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to SYK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SYK is currently averaging 1,212,912 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with SYK.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SYK's consensus estimate, increasing from $10.00 to $10.02 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that SYK is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Stryker on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

501,5dbb0f58-cbd1-3f76-aefc-8abe2d3a702b,GE,2023-04-12,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights General Electric, Vector Group and Live Ventures",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-general-131601103.html,1681218961,STORY,"['VGR', 'GE', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 11, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses General Electric GE, Vector Group VGR and Live Ventures LIVE.Industry: Diversified OperationsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2076191/3-top-stocks-from-the-buoyant-diversified-operations-industryEasing supply chain disruptions and reduced lead times bode well for the Zacks Diversified Operations industry. Pricing actions to counter raw material cost inflation are aiding the industry participants' margin performance. While the Federal Reserve's continued interest rate hikes are weighing on the manufacturing sector, strength across prominent end markets acts as a key catalyst of the industry's growth in the near term.Amid the buoyancy in the industry, General Electric, Vector Group and Live Ventures are poised for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end-markets, including oil &amp; gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction, and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines, and engineered fluid-process equipment.The industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. In addition, a few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets, and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Diversified Operations IndustryWeakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Although at a slower rate, inflation continues to rise, prompting the federal reserve to hike interest rates. This has been taking a toll on the manufacturing sector as evident from Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) latest report. In March, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index touched 46.3%, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activities for the fifth consecutive month. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity.Story continuesThe New Orders Index has remained in contraction territory for the past several months. Amid the slowdown in the manufacturing sector, industry participants are experiencing a low-demand environment. However, a turnaround in the situation is expected in the second half of 2023 as the U.S. economy remains healthy.Easing Supply Chain Issues: While supply chain issues remain, the situation has substantially improved, with companies seeing reduced lead times and faster deliveries. These augur well for the industry's growth in 2023. Pricing actions to mitigate raw material cost inflation support the industry players' margin performance. The digitalization of business operations has enabled industry participants to boost their competitiveness with enhanced operational productivity and product quality.Strength Across Key End-Markets: Despite the slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets remains stable. Companies offering construction materials are expected to benefit from the strengthening reroofing market in the United States. Companies with exposure to the life sciences vertical should benefit from strength across instruments and consumables businesses, while those catering to the Biotechnology vertical should benefit from robust customer activity in the bioprocessing business.Continued recovery in the commercial market augurs well for companies focused on the Aerospace division. Companies with exposure to the transportation and electronics market should gain from growth in advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety businesses.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Healthy ProspectsThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #54. This rank places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate has been revised upward by 12.4% since 2022 end.Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it is worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500Over the past year, the Zacks Diversified Operations has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index. The industry has gained 4.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 Index's 13.4% increase.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of EV/EBITDA (F12M), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing diversified operations stocks, the industry is currently trading at 10.3X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 11.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.14X, as low as 8.45X and at the median of 10.79X.3 Diversified Operations Stocks to BuyEach of the stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.General Electric: Headquartered in Boston, MA, General Electric is a multinational conglomerate operating in the aviation, power, renewable energy, digital industry, additive manufacturing and venture capital and finance verticals. Strength in the Aerospace segment owing to continued recovery in the commercial market is a key growth driver for GE. Easing supply chain disruptions and rebound in the Power segment should support the company's growth in the near term. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Electric's 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 2.6% in the past 60 days. The stock has surged 46.3% in the past six months.Vector Group: A diversified holding company, Vector Group operates through its subsidiaries Liggett Group LLC and Vector Tobacco Inc., manufacturing cigarette products for adult smokers. VGR also owns New Valley LLC, which holds minority investments in real estate projects.

The stock has rallied 33.3% in the past six months.Live Ventures: A diversified holding company, LIVE Ventures focuses on value-oriented acquisitions of domestic middle-market companies.

The acquisition of Kinetic should continue to boost the Steel Manufacturing segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Live Ventures' fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by approximately 34% in the past 60 days.

General Electric is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with its Diversified Operations Industry currently in the top 22% of over 250 Zacks industries.General Electric has been focused on strengthening its businesses through aviation, healthcare, and renewable energy.

Pricing actions to counter raw material cost inflation are aiding the industry participants’ margin performance. While the Federal Reserve’s continued interest rate hikes are weighing on the manufacturing sector, strength across prominent end markets acts as a key catalyst of the industry’s growth in the near term.Amid the buoyancy in the industry, General Electric GE, Vector Group VGR and Live Ventures LIVE are poised for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end-markets, including oil &amp; gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction, and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines, and engineered fluid-process equipment. The industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. In addition, a few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets, and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Diversified Operations IndustryWeakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Although at a slower rate, inflation continues to rise, prompting the federal reserve to hike interest rates. This has been taking a toll on the manufacturing sector as evident from Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) latest report. In March, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index touched 46.3%, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activities for the fifth consecutive month. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index has remained in contraction territory for the past several months. Amid the slowdown in the manufacturing sector, industry participants are experiencing a low-demand environment. However, a turnaround in the situation is expected in the second half of 2023 as the U.S. economy remains healthy.Easing Supply Chain Issues: While supply chain issues remain, the situation has substantially improved, with companies seeing reduced lead times and faster deliveries. These augur well for the industry’s growth in 2023. Pricing actions to mitigate raw material cost inflation support the industry players’ margin performance. The digitalization of business operations has enabled industry participants to boost their competitiveness with enhanced operational productivity and product quality.Strength Across Key End-Markets: Despite the slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets remains stable. Companies offering construction materials are expected to benefit from the strengthening reroofing market in the United States. Companies with exposure to the life sciences vertical should benefit from strength across instruments and consumables businesses, while those catering to the Biotechnology vertical should benefit from robust customer activity in the bioprocessing business. Continued recovery in the commercial market augurs well for companies focused on the Aerospace division. Companies with exposure to the transportation and electronics market should gain from growth in advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety businesses.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Reflects Healthy ProspectsThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #54. This rank places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

The industry’s earnings estimate has been revised upward by 12.4% since 2022 end.Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio.

General Electric: Headquartered in Boston, MA, General Electric is a multinational conglomerate operating in the aviation, power, renewable energy, digital industry, additive manufacturing and venture capital and finance verticals.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), TotalEnergies SE (TTE) and Raytheon Technologies Corp. (RTX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Texas Instruments have gained +6.7% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +12.8%. The company is benefiting from growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets. Moreover, a solid rebound in the automotive market remains a positive.Further, the strengthening demand in industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a tailwind. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.However, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds. Further, weakness in the Analog segment of the company is a concern. Additonally, softness in the personal electronics end-market remains an overhang.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +17.4%). The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets acts as a tailwind.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TTE has enough liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations. TTE is making investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, TTE’s production is impacted by the security-related production cuts in some regions. TTE remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. A natural decline in production and TTE’s withdrawal from Russia might affect profitability.(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Raytheon Technologies’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry over the past six months (+21.4% vs. +18.1%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its combat-proven defense products and expects both domestic and international program growth to remain robust for its defense business.This should boost the revenue generation prospects for its defense business. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic continues to boost commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for it. The stock holds a solid solvency position.Yet, economic sanctions imposed by governments in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might hurt Raytheon. A comparative analysis of its trailing 12-month Price/Book ratio indicates a relatively gloomy picture, which may concern investors’. The appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock.(You can read the full research report on Raytheon Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Morgan Stanley (MS), Sony Group Corp.

We expect the insurer to retain this momentum, banking on a compelling product portfolio, leadership position, healthy policies in force, better pricing and a solid retention ratio.Policy life expectancy, a measure of customer retention, has improved in the last few years across all business lines. Strategic initiatives to provide consumers with a distinctive new auto insurance option along with competitive pricing should help Progressive retain its momentum. The insurer thus has been focusing on cross-selling homes with auto insurance.PGR’s combined ratio averaged less than 93% in a decade and compared favorably with the industry average of more than 100%. Prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development should help Progressive continue to deliver improvement in the combined ratio.In tandem with the industry, PGR continues to invest heavily in technology. It estimates accelerated digitalization to improve the non-acquisition ratio in 2023.Banking on operational excellence, PGR has a solid capital position and engages in capital deployment that in turn enhances shareholders’ value.

Siren offers transportation, logistics and pressure-reduction services in addition to two expandable Permian sites with a 16-MMcf-per-day capability for natural gas compression. Subject to customary closing adjustments, Liberty paid an overall cash price of $78 million to acquire Siren.With Liberty at the forefront of this revolution, the oilfield is undergoing a generational technological shift in fuel consumption from diesel to clean natural gas.

The sale was completed on Mar 31, 2023, following receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals. Equinor Energy Ireland Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary of Equinor, sold its shares to facilitate the deal. Since the announcement of this deal, the stock has seen a decline, possibly due to apprehensions of an economic slowdown.The Corrib field, located 83 kilometers off the northwest coast of Ireland in water depths of almost 350 meters, began production in 2015. This field has long been an important non-operated project for Equinor. The company decided to sell the asset in order to focus on its portfolio, capture value from the present robust market and free up money that may be reinvested elsewhere.The deal was agreed upon a consideration of $434 million, before closing adjustments, between Equinor and the buyer. As part of the agreement, Equinor and Vermilion have consented to hedge approximately 70% of the production for 2022 and 2023. They have also agreed to a contingent payment that will be made on a portion of the revenues if European petrol prices rise beyond a certain floor level.With the sale of Corrib, Equinor will no longer have an active business presence in Ireland.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Equinor carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are CVR Energy CVI and Par Pacific Holdings Inc.

And what if you had to do it several times a year?That’s precisely the premise behind earnings season. And soon, we’ll be in the thick of the Q1 2023 cycle.Q4 2022 earnings season turned out to be better than expected, with a feared earnings “apocalypse” failing to materialize. Many companies, such as Meta Platforms META, Netflix NFLX, and Uber Technologies UBER positively surprised in their own respective ways, helping lift sentiment.Now, with the Q1 2023 cycle kicking off, we have some notable quarterly reports rolling in this week, including those from JPMorgan JPM, United Health UNH, and Delta Air Lines DAL.

As the company has significant exposure to the healthcare business, continued membership growth is likely to have aided the quarterly performance. Community-based and senior offerings are expected to have aided the unit.UnitedHealthcare BusinessThrough this segment, UNH offers healthcare benefits around the world. While it has significant exposure to the Medicare and Medicaid markets, it also serves individuals and employers. The defensive properties of the sector enable UnitedHealth to maintain its momentum despite economic headwinds. In the last reported quarter, the segment’s revenues jumped 11.8% year over year to $63 billion, while operating income improved 38.2% to $2.9 billion.UnitedHealthcare's Q4 PerformanceConsidering the unit’s products, premiums increased 12.1% year over year to $60.1 billion in the fourth quarter while service revenues rose 3.2% to $2.5 billion. Total revenues from Employer &amp; Individual Domestic, Medicare &amp; Retirement, and Community &amp; State businesses came in at $60.9 billion, increasing 12.1%. Also, from global operations, UNH reported revenues of $2,168 million, up 5.6% year over year.Forecast for Q1 Segment PerformanceThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s revenues indicates a 10.7% year-over-year increase from the year-ago level of $62.6 billion while our estimate suggests a 9.3% rise. The consensus mark for first-quarter operating income signals a 4.8% year-over-year rise from $3,798 million a year ago.The consensus mark for first-quarter 2023 medical care ratio is pegged at 82.5%, indicating a deterioration from the year-ago level of 82%, while our estimate of 82.4% suggests a lower slump.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2023 global revenues indicates 9.3% year-over-year growth from $2,133 million. The consensus mark for UnitedHealthcare’s Community &amp; State revenues suggests an 11% rise from the year-ago period’s $15.5 billion.Story continuesThe consensus mark for Medicare &amp; Retirement business’ revenues signals 10.7% year-over-year growth from $29.1 billion a year ago while our estimate indicates a 9.6% improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total number of people served in commercial domestic business indicates a 2% increase from the year-ago level of 26,410 thousand while our estimate predicts a 1.6% rise.Final ThoughtsThe UnitedHealthcare unit is expected to have positioned the company for remarkable year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s first-quarter earnings signals a 13.8% increase from the prior-year figure of $5.49 per share while our estimate suggests a 12.5% rise. The consensus estimate for revenues of $89.4 billion indicates an 11.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure while our estimate suggests a 10.9% rise.However, higher costs and expenses might have affected the margins in the first quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain. Our estimate for medical costs indicates an 11% year-over-year increase while we expect operating expenses to have jumped 13.5%. Further, we expect the cost of products sold to have jumped 2.6% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.1%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.19%.Heading into today, shares of the largest U.S. health insurer had gained 11.4% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's gain of 4.07% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.13% in that time.UnitedHealth Group will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 14, 2023. On that day, UnitedHealth Group is projected to report earnings of $6.25 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 13.84%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $89.43 billion, up 11.58% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $24.91 per share and revenue of $358.96 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.26% and +10.73%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. UnitedHealth Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Story continuesInvestors should also note UnitedHealth Group's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 20.58. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.49, so we one might conclude that UnitedHealth Group is trading at a premium comparatively.It is also worth noting that UNH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.44. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Medical - HMOs stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.94 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Medical - HMOs industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 104, which puts it in the top 42% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Strong expansion in value-based arrangements at the Optum Health segment also contributed to the upside. However, the upside was partly offset by elevated operating costs.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the first-quarter earnings announcement.Where Do the Estimates Stand?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share of $6.25 suggests a 13.8% increase from the prior-year figure of $5.49 while our estimate of $6.17 indicates a 12.5% year-over-year increase. The consensus mark has remained stable over the past week.The consensus estimate for first-quarter revenues of $89.4 billion indicates an 11.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure while our estimate suggests 10.9% year-over-year growth.UnitedHealth beat the consensus estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, with the average being 4.4%. This is depicted in the graph below:UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteFactors to NoteUnitedHealth’s first-quarter results are expected to be supported by increased premiums, backed by strong membership growth. Our estimatefor revenues from premiums suggests a 10.5% year-over-year increase. Solid domestic commercial benefit insurance sales are likely to have aided premium growth.While our estimate for product revenues indicates marginal year-over-year growth, the same for services revenues predicts around 30% year-over-year growth from the year-ago level of $6,372 million. Higher services revenues across the board are likely to have aided UNH’s top line in the first quarter.Story continuesRevenues from UnitedHealthcare, UNH’s largest segment that sells insurance, are likely to have risen on higher memberships in selected programs. As such, our estimate for segmental revenues signals a more than 9% year-over-year rise. Furthermore, investments and other income are likely to have witnessed a significant increase from the year-ago level.The Optum business segment is expected to have witnessed a higher contribution from the sub-segments, especially in OptumHealth and Optum Insight, in the first quarter. A rise in the number of people being catered to in value-based care arrangements and the growing strength of affiliated physicians is likely to aid the results.Optum Insight is likely to have witnessed higher profits, owing to the addition of Change Healthcare, growth in services and technology offerings, as well as improved productivity. Our estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment suggests a 34.7% year-over-year increase. This is expected to have positioned the company for a year-over-year rise in the bottom line.However, UnitedHealth is likely to have faced an elevated expense level due to a rise in medical and operating costs. Higher costs of products sold are likely to have reduced its margins. Our estimates for medical and operating costs indicate 11% and 13.5% year-over-year increases, respectively. This is likely to have affected its profit levels in the first quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -1.20%.

521,634e97aa-cd78-3291-8b1a-7b64bb3a1c0b,EL,2023-04-12,We Think Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-est-e-lauder-companies-110027006.html,1681210827,STORY,['EL'],"[Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies What Is Estée Lauder Companies's Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Estée Lauder Companies had US$5.52b in debt in December 2022; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$3.73b in cash leading to net debt of about US$1.79b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Estée Lauder Companies' LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Estée Lauder Companies had liabilities of US$5.66b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$8.36b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$3.73b in cash and US$1.93b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$8.35b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Since publicly traded Estée Lauder Companies shares are worth a very impressive total of US$85.9b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Estée Lauder Companies has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.54. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 21.1 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. It is just as well that Estée Lauder Companies's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 25% over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Estée Lauder Companies can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Estée Lauder Companies produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 73% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewHappily, Estée Lauder Companies's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But we must concede we find its EBIT growth rate has the opposite effect. All these things considered, it appears that Estée Lauder Companies can comfortably handle its current debt levels. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST).

For first-quarter 2023, we expect Google Cloud revenue to grow 9.7% year over year.Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques, and growing interest in home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Also, Alphabet’s expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Its growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives.However, sluggishness in the company’s advertisement business remains a major headwind.

The company being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register impressive sales and earnings numbers.The Zacks analyst expect the company to register a 6.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2023 on 6.5% revenue growth. This outlook accounts for the businesses’ ability to navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and supply chain bottlenecks on several fronts.A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming.

523,2e25c524-7636-3b0c-8cb6-45eaaf8694f1,ADP,2023-04-12,Automatic Data Processing: A Dividend Growth Stock,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automatic-data-processing-dividend-growth-160441679.html,1681229081,STORY,['ADP'],"[Searching for stocks with good dividends and solid fundamentals? One way to find such stocks is to check out GuruFocus' Dividend Growth Portfolio screener. Only 14 stocks currently make this list due to the strict criteria, and one of those is Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), better known as ADP.In this article, we will review ADP based on the Dividend Growth Portfolio screening criteria to see why I believe we can trust this company to sustainably deliver rising dividends over the long term.Financial strengthThe first criteria on the screener is the GuruFocus financial strength rank, which must be at least 6 out of 10. ADP just meets that benchmark. Reviewing the middling rank, we see its debt has been rising while its cash and cash equivalents have shrunk over most of the past decade:Automatic Data Processing: A Dividend Growth StockAt the end of the company's fiscal year 2022, which was on June 30, it carried just under $3 billion in long-term debt. Why the growing debt? In part, its because ADP was able to take out fixed-rate notes with interest rates ranging between 1.83% and 3.47%. Thats very inexpensive capital.Otherwise, it has a reasonable interest coverage ratio of 23.13 but a concerning Altman Z-Score of 2.14, which is in the grey zone, implying some minor risk of bankruptcy.ProfitabilityThe GuruFocus profitability rank hurdle is a bit higher at 7 out of 10, but ADP passes it easily with a 9 out of 10 rank. The following chart of the income statement shows a net margin of more than 18.40%:Automatic Data Processing: A Dividend Growth StockThe operating margin is another requirement it has no trouble meeting, clearing the minimum hurdle of 10.0% at 21.26%. The company also was profitable in 10 of the past 10 years, another screener requirement.GrowthIn the revenue category, the screener calls for an average five-year revenue growth rate of at least 3.0% per year. The company exceeds that with a rate of 6.90%.Its a similar story for the five-year earnings per share without non-recurring items growth. The requirement is an average of at least 5.0% per year, while ADP delivers an average of 12.10% per year.Story continuesWhile its not required by the screener, I also wanted to know about ADPs free cash flow, which is the source of dividend funding. Over the past five years, it has grown by an average of 10.30% per year, which is enough to fund an ambitious dividend growth program.DividendsTo qualify for the Dividend Growth Portfolio, a company needs a dividend yield of at least 2.10%, and ADP currently yields 2.12%. To put these numbers into context, the S&amp;P 500 average dividend yield for March 2023 was 1.66%. This close to the edge, it's possible ADP could rop off the screener if the share price rises.The second metric is the five-year dividend growth rate, which must be at least 5.0%. At 12.90%, ADP easily passes that hurdle. Still, make a note that free cash flow has increased by an average of just 10.30% per year over the past five years.Next comes the dividend payout ratio, which must be less than 60.0%, and the company just barely squeaks by with 58.0%. This is another area that may push it off the screener.In its consolidated fiscal 2023 outlook, which was part of the fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings report, ADP said it expects its adjusted diluted EPS growth to be between 13.0% and 16.0%. As we saw above, the five-year dividend growth rate has been 12.90%.The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividends per share by earnings per share without non-recurring items. Assuming the latter is close to the adjusted diluted EPS, that could be enough to push the payout ratio over 60.0%.My takeGiven the possibility that the stock could fall from the Dividend Growth Portfolio screener because of the yield or payout ratio, is it worth considering for dividend investors? I believe it is. The stock is considered modestly undervalued by the GF Value chart, which sees a 13.81% margin of safety. Thats reinforced by a look at its five-year price chart. The chart shows a sawtooth pattern, with sharp rises and dips in recent years. And at the moment, it appears to be at or near the bottom of the cycle.Automatic Data Processing: A Dividend Growth StockOverall, the company has a GF Score of 92 out of 100. According to a backtesting study by GuruFocus, stocks with higher GF Scores tend to perform better than those with lower GF Scores. The ranks for profitability and growth suggest its dividend will be sustainable in the long term.Automatic Data Processing: A Dividend Growth StockInvestors now have an opportunity to lock in the current dividend yield and perhaps bag a significant capital gain if and when the share price rises again. Both benefits would be on top of owning a stock with a solid history of raising its dividend payments more quickly than inflation.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Although the payroll services market is still highly fragmented, the largest in that industry, Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), still has the largest market share at approximately 11%.The company provides cloud-based human capital management solutions around on a global basis. It operates in two segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization. The Employer Services segment offers payroll, benefits administration, talent management, HR management, workforce management, insurance, retirement and compliance services. The PEO Services segment provides HR outsourcing solutions to small and mid-sized businesses through a co-employment model and offers benefits packages, protection and compliance, talent engagement, expertise, comprehensive outsourcing and recruitment process outsourcing services.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with ADP. Click here to check it out. List of 52-Week LowsList of 3-Year LowsList of 5-Year LowsPayroll services are currently delivered to 40 million workers globally, which include 25 million in the U.S. and 15 million internationally. The company also partners with approximately 8,000 tax agencies in the U.S. ADP moved $2.7 trillion in payroll and taxes on behalf of clients and their employees in fiscal year 2022. Currently, the company operates in 140 countries and has over 1 million clients.Founded in 1949, the company currently has a market capitalization of $89 billion.Financial reviewIn January, the company reported its second-quarter financial results for the period ending Dec. 31, 2022. Revenue increased 9% (10% organic and constant currency) to $4.4 billion. Sales for PEO services grew 13% and Employer Services increased 10% organically. Operating income gained 15% to $1.1 billion and the operating margin increased to 24.3%. Earnings per share grew 18% to $1.95 compared to $1.65 in the prior-year period.Story continuesAutomatic Data Processing typically holds billions in float, or wages in transit from its employer-related services. As of Dec. 31, those amounts totaled $40.8 billion. The company earns interest on that float and is the beneficiary of a rising rate environment. Interest earned increased 77% to $187 million during the quarter. Substantially all of these funds are invested in investment-grade securities.ADP generates significant amounts of free cash flow and maintains a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. Organic reinvestment is a key strategy and, in the 2022 fiscal year, the company spent $1.2 billion in systems development and programming. Targeted acquisitions is another important aspect and in recent years, the company spent $615 million to acquire Global Cash Card and Workmarket and spent $120 million to buy Celergo. Returning cash to shareholders has also been a long-time focus and the company has a 48-year track record of increasing dividends. The company has also been a routine purchaser of its own shares, having reduced the share count by approximately 1% annually over the past 10 years.ValuationConsensus earnings per share estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 is $8.12 and $9.01 for the following year. That puts ADP selling at 26 times earnings and with an enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of 18. That is roughly in line with major competitor Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX). The price-earnings ratio is also close to the high end of recent trading ranges.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow creates a value of only $134 per share when using $8.12 in earnings as the starting point and a long-term growth rate of 8%.The average price target by Wall Street analysts is $248 with a high of $278 and a low of $211.The company currently pays a dividend of $5 on an annualized basis, which equates to a 2.31% dividend yield.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased shares of Automatic Data Processing recently include Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio). Investors who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio)'s Bridgewater Associates.SummaryThe fortunes of ADP and other employee-related service companies are typically tied to the overall economy, in particular the levels of unemployment. During the brief Covid-19 recession and high levels of unemployment, ADP's stock dropped over 40% from its highs. Nonetheless, the company successfully managed its operations during this time and has raised its dividend almost every year.A stronger economy or maintaining current levels will continue to benefit the company if it is to avoid the cyclical swings in private sector employment. ADP has always been thought of as a well managed, high-quality company and often attracts investor interest throughout most economic cycles.In periods of high unemployment, the stock often becomes attractive as many investors focus on the long term and ignore short-term swings in the economy. We are not at those levels now as U.S. unemployment is still remarkably low at 3.5%. When the large-scale tech layoffs become recognized and a recessionary environment occurs, it is possible the unemployment rate will skyrocket and have a negative affect on ADPs earnings.Investors may be better off waiting for bad times before investing in ADP and hold until the good times return, as they always do.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
525,a31f86c4-9e4e-301e-9c71-ffea5c312295,ADP,2023-04-12,The 3 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for April,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-dividend-stocks-buy-200306459.html,1680897786,STORY,"['KMB', 'MO', 'ADP']","[Investing in dividend stocks is vital to many long-term investors. Dividends are a discretionary distribution of profits paid to investors, usually by publicly-traded companies. One reason to buy dividend stocks in April is that many firms will pay dividends during the month. That is true of the shares listed below.Dividends are, as mentioned above, discretionary. But realistically, once a company initiates a dividend policy, it will likely continue to do so. Further, those dividend-bearing companies seek to increase these distributions over time. Those that do so tend to be among the most stable long-term holdings, seeing steady results and long-term price appreciation.Let’s look at a few of the best dividend stocks to buy in April.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMOAltria$44.43KMBKimberly-Clark$136.49ADPAutomatic Data Processing$216.11Altria (MO)a sign with the Altria (MO) logoSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comAltria (NYSE:MO) is a well-known tobacco giant facing a pivotal period in its business history. It’s no secret that the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined dramatically in the last few decades. In 2005, nearly 21% of adults smoked, but by 2020, that percentage had dropped to 13%. The steep decline in cigarette smoking has affected big tobacco dramatically. Relying on cigarettes is no longer a viable business strategy.That means that Altria, like all big tobacco companies, is in flux. The company is pivoting to smoke-free tobacco and other smoke-free products. The Marlboro cigarette maker is primarily expanding into vapes, nicotine pouches, and smoke-free tobacco. Indeed, the company is working diligently toward that goal, having recently purchased NJOY and its e-cigarette brand for $2.75 billion. Altria anticipates doubling its smoke-free revenues by 2028 to $5 billion.For dividend investors, this is good news. The company’s stock price has fallen since 2017, but Altria’s dividend policy has remained unchanged. It hasn’t reduced its payment since 1970. That means current investors get the opportunity to buy cheaper stock, with a sky-high dividend yielding 8.4%. That is generally a very high-risk indicator, but Altria is not going anywhere. In other words, ride that high-yield dividend, and hope the company can fulfill its promise to deliver nicotine in novel ways.Story continuesKimberly-Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is a healthy dividend stock from just about any perspective. It yields 3.5% currently, which is below the 4% threshold some characterize as denoting risk. Additionally, KMB stock remains well below the higher 6% risky threshold others use to define acceptability.Kimberly-Clark is a company with a stable dividend, having last been reduced in 1973. The maker of Huggies, Kleenex, and Depends is neither the most exciting company, nor the fastest-growing. In 2022, revenues increased by 4% to $20.2 billion. Additionally, Kimberly-Clark’s management anticipates 2023 will see those sales increase by 0% to 2%. Again, not precisely strong growth.But Kimberly-Clark is trading at a price-earnings ratio in line with average levels, relative to the last decade. It isn’t overpriced right now. Growth can be expected when the current business cycle is nearer to its end. When that happens, no one can say for sure. But KMB stock will pay a nice dividend to those who invest in April, which will continue afterward.Automatic Data Processing (ADP)calculator, pen, paper and a binder that says ""payroll"" on the sideSource: ShutterstockAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) primarily offers payroll and attendance software solutions, along with other HR services. Like Kimberly-Clark, it’s arguably a very dull company. But boring can often be very good in the world of dividend investing.In any case, ADP is in a solid position, providing investors with 5-6% expected market growth and 8-9% overall growth in 2022. Automatic Data Processing anticipates 12-15% total shareholder return over the medium-term at a 2% dividend yield. Its current yield is 2.3%, so that return may be higher.From the average target stock price alone, investors might expect a 13% return over the next year. That return is based on a current share price of approximately $216 and a target price of $245.88 plus four $1.25 quarterly dividends. Again, not a particularly interesting company, but who cares? This is a company providing attractive returns, making ADP stock an easy choice for investors looking for companies with strong total return potential.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Ray Dalio's hedge fund, and go directly to read 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio. Ray Dalio is an American billionaire investor who founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975 in New York. He has a unique investment philosophy that is based on principles of radical transparency, meaningful work, and the importance of diversification. One of the core principles of Dalio's investment philosophy is the concept of ""risk parity."" This means that he believes that investors should allocate their portfolios based on the risks involved in each asset class, rather than on their historical returns. Through these strategies, Dalio built his firm into one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds. As of April 2023, the billionaire has a real-time net worth of $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.In October 2022, Dalio handed over control of Bridgewater Associates to a new generation of investors and turned his majority stake over to the board. This team of investment professionals is mainly responsible for choosing stocks and making investment decisions. Dalio will remain the chief investment officer mentor and will maintain his position on the firm’s operating board of directors. Following this development, Dalio tweeted:""Hopefully until I die, I will continue to be a mentor, an investor, and a board member at Bridgewater, because I and they love doing those things together.""Currently, Nir Bar Dea is serving as the chief executive officer of the firm. Under the new leadership, the hedge fund plans to expand its international footprint and develop artificial intelligence technologies. Earlier this year, the firm doubled its assets in China to over $2.93 billion, as reported by Reuters. Through this, Bridgewater becomes the biggest foreign hedge fund in the country. The firm launched its China fund in 2018 and delivered an annualized return of 15.6% through October 2022.Story continuesThroughout his career, Dalio focused on the current economic trends and talked about continuous interest rate hikes last year. He also recently spoke to Bloomberg about the wider implications of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. He said that this fallout would result in declining debt and credit markets. Here are some comments from the investors:“It is likely that this bank failure will be followed by many more problems before the contraction phase of the cycle runs its course. We are approaching the turning point.”Over the years, Bridgewater has delivered strong returns to shareholders. We previously reported that the firm’s flagship fund Pure Alpha II delivered an annual average return of 11.4% since its inception in 1991 through June 2022. The fund’s Pure Alpha also outperformed the market last year, gaining roughly 9.5%, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500.As of the close of Q4 2022, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of over $18.3 billion, compared with $19.7 billion in the previous quarter. A majority of the companies in the portfolio are dividend payers and have rewarded shareholders with regular dividends.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.” Click to continue reading and see 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio.  Suggested articles:The 15 Best Selling Products Online10 Cheap REITs with Huge Upside12 Cheap Global Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:SRCL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Stericycle The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$192.7mUS$288.0mUS$339.5mUS$379.5mUS$436.0mUS$477.6mUS$512.5mUS$541.9mUS$567.0mUS$589.0mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.55%Est @ 7.31%Est @ 5.74%Est @ 4.64%Est @ 3.87% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$177US$244US$265US$273US$289US$291US$288US$280US$270US$258(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.6bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$589m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.1%) = US$9.2bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$9.2b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$4.0bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$6.7b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$42.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Stericycle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.099. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for StericycleStrengthNo major strengths identified for SRCL.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

In the past, time-sensitive ticketed attractions have proven to pull in traffic at MAC’s top-performing properties, making its latest move a strategic fit.Both these attractions are being introduced to Macerich by Kilburn Live, a global market leader in branded live entertainment, collectively with Fever, the leading entertainment discovery platform.Reflecting broader market concerns, shares of MAC lost 1.27% on Apr 7 regular trading session on the NYSE.The Dr. Seuss Experience, an imaginative and interactive immersion into the wondrous world of Dr. Seuss, is scheduled to open in early April.World of Barbie, which allows guests to explore a life-size Barbie Dreamhouse, try out several Barbie careers displayed in various interactive rooms and even sit behind the wheel of a full-size Barbie Camper Van, is slated to open in mid-April.Also, MAC’s town centers have showcased the pop-culture touring art exhibit based on the work of British street art icon Banksy — Banksy Was Here — which is now open through May 31, 2023, at Fashion District Philadelphia. The immersive, candy-themed wonderland, Candytopia, opened mid-March at Tysons Corner Center.Further, in December 2022, Santa Monica Place hosted Michael Murphy's art exhibition, Perceptual Shift, which featured a unique collection of thought-provoking installations from the world's top perceptual artist.Per Petra Maruca, senior vice president, business development, Macerich, “As we continue to evolve our high-quality real estate to meet the needs of our communities, ticketed attractions fit well with our overall strategy of adding more uses and more reasons for people to spend time at Macerich properties.”Macerich has a portfolio of premium assets in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor. These properties are located in densely populated areas, where affluent consumers with significant disposable incomes live and play, offering the company solid scope to generate decent cash flows.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.As a result, retail REITs, including Macerich, are expected to experience a rise in leasing activity and pricing power, and flourish.In 2022, the company signed 974 new and renewal leases for roughly 3.8 million square feet. Its portfolio occupancy improved year over year from 91.5% to 92.6% as of Dec 31, 2022.Recently, the company welcomed Chinese restaurant — Din Tai Fung — to Santa Monica Place, and fashion retailer — Zara — and Irish retail brand — Primark — to Queens Center in New York City.Nonetheless, higher e-commerce adoption and rising interest rates are key concerns for Macerich.  Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 16% over the past three months compared with its industry's decline of 5.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Urstadt Biddle Properties UBA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Analysts were expecting a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.The carrier also slightly trimmed its fuel price forecast to $3.27 to $3.32 per gallon for the first quarter from its prior estimate of $3.33 to $3.38 per gallon. It had paid $2.80 per gallon in the first quarter of last year.Southwest Airlines Co closed down 1.4%, United was down 6.5% and Delta was down 2.4%.(Reporting by Aishwarya Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Arun Koyyur and Anil D'Silva)]"

One of these is a seasonal service from Worcester, MA, to Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, FL.  Flights (non-stop) on this route will be operational from Jan 4, 2024.Initially, flights will operate twice a week on this route. However, from mid-February till the end of the Red Sox Spring Training, flights will operate daily to meet the anticipated demand swell.The other route will be operating from Worcester, MA to Orlando Sanford International Airport. Flights to Orlando, which stopped during the pandemic, will resume operation from Jun 15. This will imply that JBLU is the sole airline offering non-stop service between the two cities.Expressing delight at the route additions, Robin Hayes, the chief executive officer of JetBlue said ""We are proud to introduce even more options to connect our Massachusetts customers to the places they want to fly with more nonstop Florida service from Worcester."" Once the new routes become operational, JetBlue will offer services to three cities in Florida – Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Fort Myers – from Worcester.Driven by the stronger-than-expected revival of air-travel demand, shares of JBLU have gained 9.1% year to date, outperforming its industry’s 5% appreciation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven this backdrop, the decision to introduce new routes is extremely prudent.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: FedEx Corp's FDX, American Airlines AAL and Copa Holdings CPA.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:3 Transportation Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q1 Earnings SeasonThe Zacks Transportation sector was one of the worst-hit corners during the pandemic. After being battered in 2020 and 2021, with economic activities shrinking drastically, the fortunes of sector participants turned out for the better in 2022. Economic activities started bouncing back following the easing of the pandemic-induced restrictions. The scenario continues to be buoyant in 2023.UpsidesWithin the sector, the airline industry is witnessing increased passengers, with a continued rise in air-travel demand. The bright scenario is highlighted by data provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) with respect to passenger volumes. In the first quarter of 2023  (January-March period), TSA checkpoint numbers revealed that passenger volumes not only surpassed the 2022 levels but also exceeded the 2019 (pre-coronavirus) numbers on many days.It is hardly surprising that the pace of growth of e-commerce demand has slowed from the levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic. Despite the slowdown, as economies re-open, the same has been impressive, driven by the convenience associated with online shopping. The race to digitization also supports the momentum in e-commerce growth.  E-commerce demand strength should continue to support growth of industry players. Favorable pricing also bears good news for industry participants.With economic activities gaining pace, more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile through dividends and buybacks to pacify the long-suffering shareholders, thereby underlining their financial strength and confidence in their businesses. For example, recently, FedEx Corp'sboard of directors approved a dividend hike of 10%, thereby raising its quarterly cash dividend from $1.15 ($4.60 annualized) per share to $1.26 ($5.04 annualized).Story continues3 Transportation Stocks to Buy NowWith the first-quarter 2023 earnings season around the corner, we have highlighted three stocks —American Airlines, Copa Holdings and FedEx — from the Transportation sector. The companies carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.These companies have witnessed impressive earnings estimate revisions for the current year. Also, all the above-mentioned stocks have outperformed the sector with respect to price in the first quarter of 2023.Copa Holdings: The company is benefiting from the improvement in air-travel demand. In fourth-quarter 2022, passenger revenues increased 29.5% due to higher yields. CPA's focus on its cargo segment is encouraging as well. In fourth-quarter 2022, cargo and mail revenues grew 69%, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable.The above-mentioned tailwinds are likely to continue aiding this Latin American carrier that currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's current-year earnings has been revised 12.3% upward over the past 60 days.American Airlines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, is seeing a steady recovery in domestic air-travel demand. AAL has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL's current-year earnings has improved 19.6% over the past 60 days. AAL delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.79%, on average.FedEx: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, is being well served by its cost-cutting efforts. The cost-saving endeavors are driving its bottom line amid weakening demand. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well.FDX's management expects earnings per share between $14.6 and $15.2 for 2023 (prior to MTM retirement plans accounting for adjustments, and excluding estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives and costs related to business realignment activities). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FDX's current-year earnings has improved 6.9% over the past 60 days.

Industry players like O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone are worth adding to your watchlist now.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry players execute several functions. These include manufacturing, retailing, distribution and installation of vehicle parts, equipment and accessories. Vehicle parts and accessories include seat covers, antifreeze, engine additives, wiper blades, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts and fuel pumps.Consumers have two options: they can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own (the 'do-it-yourself' or 'DIY' segment) or take the assistance of a professional repair facility (the 'do-it-for me' or 'DIFM' segment). The industry is highly competitive and undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Key Themes Shaping the IndustryVehicle Demand Aiding Parts Sales: A recession may be on the horizon but one can't see the signs of it in the vehicle market just yet. Most auto biggies reported year-over-year retail delivery growth for the first quarter of 2023 amid pent-up demand on improving inventory levels. Fleet sales also witnessed a year-over-year uptick. Per Cox Automotive, U.S. auto sales are likely to have grown around 6% year over year in the first quarter of 2023. Amid rising vehicle sales, demand for auto retail and wholesale parts has also been on the rise, aiding industry participants.Story continuesTech Advancement Creating Opportunities: The industry is undergoing a radical change with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers. An increase in the number of new, complicated and high-tech vehicles has compelled consumers to opt for more professional assistance instead of opting for DIY (""Do It Yourself""). Widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization is resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Omnichannel marketing and digitization ramp-up are boosting sales.Cost Woes Remain a Challenge: Rising commodity and labor costs, and logistical challenges are acting as headwinds.High raw materials costs like resin, steel, copper and aluminum have increased the overall manufacturing costs of the companies and are adversely impacting gross margins. At the same time, capex requirements and R&amp;D costs are on the rise owing to the development of superior technological platforms and sophisticated tools.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Promising ScenarioThe Zacks Auto Retail &amp; Wholesale Parts industry is a five-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #66, which places it in the top 26% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

With a single indicator of dividend growth, these companies display many of the characteristics a strong long-term investment should have. Even better is that these stocks have near term catalysts because of their upward trending earnings revisions, and high Zacks Ranks.For dividend growers like these, consistently raising dividends has become a critical pitch to investors. This is a very good thing for the stock holders, because management will always be focused on raising the dividend payments and won’t get side tracked by any other poor capital allocation projects.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) share price is up 74% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 46% (ignoring dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Sherwin-Williams managed to grow its earnings per share at 4.3% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Sherwin-Williams' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Sherwin-Williams' TSR for the last 5 years was 81%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Sherwin-Williams shareholders are down 13% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 7.6%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Sherwin-Williams (1 shouldn't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:UHS) Could Be Worth Watching",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-universal-health-services-inc-145613349.html,1681224973,STORY,['UHS'],"[While Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Universal Health Services’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Universal Health Services What's The Opportunity In Universal Health Services?Good news, investors! Universal Health Services is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 13.43x is currently well-below the industry average of 23.46x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Universal Health Services’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Universal Health Services?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 18% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Universal Health Services. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since UHS is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UHS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UHS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.If you'd like to know more about Universal Health Services as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

548,016689f6-1f25-3826-9c11-a259fb36c60b,UHS,2023-04-12,4 Stocks in Focus as Hospital Industry Witnesses Improvement,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-focus-hospital-industry-123912611.html,1681216752,STORY,"['HCA', 'THC', 'UHS', 'ACHC', '^GSPC']","[After facing multiple issues for several quarters, hospital companies are witnessing improving market conditions thanks to the easing staffing challenges and increasing non-Covid utilization. As serious medical conditions continue to rise, outpatient surgeries and patient days are likely to increase, boosting Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players’ revenues. However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to provide companies with a competitive edge and improve efficiency. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC should benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services. Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryRising Patient Volumes: With declining COVID-related utilization of resources, non-COVID admissions are expected to grow. As serious medical conditions are rising, demand for elective procedures is likely to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements, and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide patients with some respite, which can help them navigate tough times.Story continuesGrowing Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. By 2034, older adults are expected to outnumber children, a first in the country’s history. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Advancements: Technological improvements, innovations and wider adoption will continue to support hospital players. This should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future. The companies are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The industry players are using the virtual health domain to enhance efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and reducing their treatment costs.Rising Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. Increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. However, improving labor shortages and staffing challenges will provide hospital companies some breathing room. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Promising ScenarioThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #103, which places it in the top 41% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 4.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 7.1% and the Zacks Medical sector’s decrease of 15.2%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.90X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.55X and the sector’s 8.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.05X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.80X, as the charts below show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Stocks Worth Your AttentionWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues. UHS’ plans to add new capacities in hospitals in important markets of Texas and California to address strong acute care demand are expected to be major tailwinds. It has a strong share buyback plan in place to boost shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health’s 2023 bottom line indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 5.2% increase from a year ago.

The company plans to add roughly 300 beds through facility expansions and open a minimum of six CTCs in 2023. Its moves to streamline its portfolio boost operating efficiency and profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC’s 2023 bottom line indicates 9.6% year-over-year growth.

The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 3.7% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 65.2%.

For starters, many reward their shareholders with dividends, providing a passive income stream.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy Is Alliant Energy Fairly Valued?As Alliant Energy operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%. Relative to the current share price of US$54.9, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$2.0 / (6.8% – 2.1%)= US$42.0dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alliant Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Alliant EnergyStrengthNo major strengths identified for LNT.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electric Utilities industry.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For Alliant Energy, we've put together three additional elements you should consider:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Alliant Energy   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.Future Earnings: How does LNT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Ray Dalio's hedge fund, and go directly to read 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio. Ray Dalio is an American billionaire investor who founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975 in New York. He has a unique investment philosophy that is based on principles of radical transparency, meaningful work, and the importance of diversification. One of the core principles of Dalio's investment philosophy is the concept of ""risk parity."" This means that he believes that investors should allocate their portfolios based on the risks involved in each asset class, rather than on their historical returns. Through these strategies, Dalio built his firm into one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds. As of April 2023, the billionaire has a real-time net worth of $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.In October 2022, Dalio handed over control of Bridgewater Associates to a new generation of investors and turned his majority stake over to the board. This team of investment professionals is mainly responsible for choosing stocks and making investment decisions. Dalio will remain the chief investment officer mentor and will maintain his position on the firm’s operating board of directors. Following this development, Dalio tweeted:""Hopefully until I die, I will continue to be a mentor, an investor, and a board member at Bridgewater, because I and they love doing those things together.""Currently, Nir Bar Dea is serving as the chief executive officer of the firm. Under the new leadership, the hedge fund plans to expand its international footprint and develop artificial intelligence technologies. Earlier this year, the firm doubled its assets in China to over $2.93 billion, as reported by Reuters. Through this, Bridgewater becomes the biggest foreign hedge fund in the country. The firm launched its China fund in 2018 and delivered an annualized return of 15.6% through October 2022.Story continuesThroughout his career, Dalio focused on the current economic trends and talked about continuous interest rate hikes last year. He also recently spoke to Bloomberg about the wider implications of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. He said that this fallout would result in declining debt and credit markets. Here are some comments from the investors:“It is likely that this bank failure will be followed by many more problems before the contraction phase of the cycle runs its course.

Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.” Click to continue reading and see 5 High-Dividend Stocks Picked By Billionaire Ray Dalio.  Suggested articles:The 15 Best Selling Products Online10 Cheap REITs with Huge Upside12 Cheap Global Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Covid Treatment Stocks to Buy Today. If there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the world. The deadly disease, which first surfaced in 2019 and rapidly spread all over the world in 2020 became one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is staggering as well, with data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggesting that as of March 16, 2023, 6.8 million people have lost their lives to the virus; a figure that pales in comparison to the 760 million confirmed cases of the virus.These staggering figures have an economic cost to them as well, which naturally cannot be compared to the loss of life. Still, if the number of infections and deaths did not stun you, perhaps the projected economic costs will. According to estimates from the International Monetary Fund -  a global body that aims to help distressed economies - the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic will cost the world a whopping $12.5 trillion by 2024. For reference, the global economy was estimated to sit at $96 trillion in 2021 according to estimates from the world bank, so if the IMF's forecast bears fruit, then the economic damage from the virus will have eaten out a significant chunk of global economic output.Still, the pandemic also saw an unprecedented global response where vaccines were flown around to all corners of the world to aid the battle against the coronavirus. The WHO also estimates that as of March 11, 2023, a stunning 13 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Using the World Bank's population estimates from 2021, which place the global population at 7.8 billion, almost two vaccine doses per person have been administered so far - an achievement that has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in containing the virus. The rapid vaccination has ensured that as the world entered 2023, the trend of coronavirus deaths and cases began to drop from earlier peaks that took place at different times in different places of the world.Story continuesAt the same time, the number of treatments and vaccines available in the fight against the virus has also significantly grown. While initially, particularly in the Western world, a handful of vaccines from Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were available, nowadays, a lot of new players have entered into the market.These companies are entering a market that grew from no value to one spanning billions of dollars in a short time period. A research report from the WHO estimates that $141 billion of vaccines were shipped globally in 2021, for an approximately 3.5x growth from 2021 - demonstrating the scale of the global response against the pandemic. At the same time, it indicates that vaccine manufacturing is still a highly specialized process, with ten manufacturers accounting for 70% of all the vaccines shipped. Zooming in on the coronavirus vaccine market itself, Transparency Market Research estimates that the segment was valued at $92.6 billion in 2021 and is expected to record a negative compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% between 2022 and 2031 to sit at an estimated $9.9 billion by the end of the forecast period. To cater to this dropping value, the research firm believes that the market participants will have to inform the general public about the benefits of herd immunization, as well as leverage their existing vaccine development experience to develop products for other diseases as well. At the same time, it also points out that the market can grow due to potential new variants of the virus that render older vaccines obsolete and require already vaccinated individuals to get additional doses. North America is estimated to be the most valuable vaccine market, with Europe coming in at second place.Pivoting from existing vaccine development experience to create new products is a trend that has already emerged in the market. The clearest example of this is Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), a company that few people had heard about prior to the pandemic and its Spikevax vaccine that was one of the most - if not the most - effective treatments to prevent severe viral infection. At its latest earnings call, the firm's president, Mr. Stephen Hoge shed some light on its diverse portfolio of fighting other respiratory infections, as he outlined:Lastly, our respiratory portfolio includes a large number of combination vaccines to provide protection against multiple respiratory pathogens which has advantages for many stakeholders, including healthcare providers, payers and consumers. These include combinations of COVID, flu and RSV as well as two pediatric vaccines that include additional viruses that are important in children, including hMPV and PIV3. As we prepare for endemic COVID in 2023 and beyond, we wanted to briefly recap the recent VRBPAC committee discussions and recommendations. At the January VRBPAC meeting, the committee voted to harmonize the primary series and booster dose vaccines, which is an important step to simplify future guidance. The FDA also indicated that it expects to convene VRBPAC to determine vaccine strain composition for the €˜23/24 season in the second quarter of this year.We believe that our mRNA platform has demonstrated its ability to deliver variant match vaccines on accelerated time horizons and we believe we are therefore well positioned to deliver whatever composition update the FDA and other public health agencies recommend. And moving to RSV, as you know, we shared the top line results from our Phase 3 RSV study in older adults earlier this year. And today, we shared additional data that was presented this morning at RSVVW. The top line results we have seen are incredibly encouraging and we are grateful to the FDA for breakthrough therapy designation for mRNA-1345, which further emphasizes the significant health impact of RSV in older adults and the high unmet need. In the top line data presented in January, the mRNA-1345 demonstrated 83.7% vaccine efficacy and the primary endpoint of lower respiratory tract disease with two or more symptoms.Today, we'll look at some covid treatment stocks, a list that also includes GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), and Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX).12 Best Covid Treatment Stocks to Buy TodayOur Methodology We sifted through pharmaceutical companies to pick out which make coronavirus treatments and checked their popularity with hedge funds.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Union Pacific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$9.8b ÷ (US$65b - US$5.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceIn the above chart we have measured Union Pacific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Union Pacific here  for free.So How Is Union Pacific's ROCE Trending?Over the past five years, Union Pacific's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So don't be surprised if Union Pacific doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. This probably explains why Union Pacific is paying out 45% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Union Pacific's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to Union Pacific's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 61% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.If you want to continue researching Union Pacific, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

CBOE have gained 16.5% in a year against the industry's decline of 20.7%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite decreased 7.4% in the said time frame. With a market capitalization of $14.4 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.7 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe rally was largely driven by optimistic medium-term target, strong market position, strategic acquisitions, strength in its proprietary products and prudent capital deployment.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a solid track of beating earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing in one, with the average being 2.57%.Can CBOE Stock Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cboe Global’s 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $7.05, indicating a 1.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 6.7% higher revenues of $1.86 billion. The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings per share is pegged at $7.30, indicating a 3.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 3.9% higher revenues of $1.93 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2023 and 2024 has moved north by 0.1% in the past seven days, reflecting analyst’s optimism.Return on equity (ROE), a measure reflecting how efficiently a company utilizes shareholders’ money, was 21.8% in the trailing 12 months. Moreover, ROE expanded 320 basis points year over year and compared favorably with the industry’s average of 10.3%.Cboe Global boasts being the largest stock exchange operator by volume in the United States and a leading market for Exchange Traded Products globally. Growth strategy of the stock exchange operator revolves around expanding its product, broadening its geographic reach to the highest value markets, diversifying its business mix with recurring revenues, ramping up growth with recurring non-transaction revenues and leveraging technology.Cboe Global projects organic total net revenue growth in the range of 7-9% in 2023, which is above the medium-term organic total net revenue guidance of 5-7%.In 2023, Cboe expects revenue-enhancing investments in the range of $28-$30 million.Cboe Global expects Data and Access Solutions organic net revenue growth in 2023 to increase by approximately 7% to 10% in 2023 in line with medium-term guidance expectations. Higher logical port fees as well as physical port fees in the Options and North American Equities segments and increased proprietary market data fees are likely to drive the Data and access solutions segment.Cboe Global boasts a compelling inorganic growth story given its prudent acquisitions. The acquisitions also helped it realize revenue and cost synergies. In June 2022, Cboe Global closed the buyout of Aequitas NEO Exchange to strengthen its foothold in a key capital market and develop a comprehensive equities platform for the Canadian market.Cboe Global continues to expect acquisitions held less than a year to add around 0.5% to total net revenue growth in 2023.Strong liquidity not only mitigates balance sheet risks but also paves the way for an accelerated capital deployment. Cboe Global has increased dividend by 4.2% in August 2022, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend hike.

This led to dismal fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both metrics declined year over year.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the adjusted loss of 75 cents compared unfavorably with a loss of 2 cents reported in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. Net sales declined 6% year over year to $4,243 million. The metric decreased 19% from the pre-pandemic level. Comparable sales (comps) fell 5% on a year-over-year basis.  The adjusted gross margin of 35% contracted 480 basis points (bps) year over year due to a 430-bps decline in adjusted merchandise margins, stemming from huge discounts and inflationary headwinds. The adjusted operating loss was $6 million in the reported quarter, excluding impairment charges related to inventory, $35 million in costs related to the transition of Old Navy Mexico, and an $83-million gain on sale related to a UK distribution center.Consequently, management expects first-quarter fiscal 2023 sales to decline in the mid-single-digit range, whereas the prior-year quarter’s reported figure was $3.5 billion. For fiscal 2023, net sales are anticipated to decrease in the low to mid-single-digit range, whereas our estimate is pegged at a 4.6% decline. This might be due to the continued uncertain consumer environment and higher promotions. Also, rising prices of essential commodities are likely to continue to hurt lower-income consumers' spending on non-essentials like apparel. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of GPS have lost 25.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 12.1% growth.Brighter Side of the StoryHowever, the company has been banking on its Athleta brand, which has been serving as a key catalyst for long. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales. Although net sales fell 1% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 for the Athleta brand, the metric grew 51% from the pre-pandemic level.Segmental results gained from continued share gains. Increased focus on performance active and active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends bodes well. It has also emerged as one of the fastest-growing women's athleisure brands in North America. Driven by these factors, Athleta has been on track to reach $2 billion in net sales by fiscal 2023.Gap is on track with its aggressive cost-management actions. The company has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure, including increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands.These actions are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, of which half is expected to be realized in the latter half of fiscal 2023.Apart from these efforts, the company is expected to realize $250 million in annualized savings, as announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Over the last six months, it identified $550 million in annualized savings in total. Gap revealed plans to further optimize its marketing spend and rationalize its technology investments over the next few years.The company’s Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly-profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, bodes well. As part of the plan, it expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute 70% to sales by 2023. As part of its 350-store closure plan, the company expects to close 50-55 Gap and Banana Republic stores this year. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023.The company expects to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations. It anticipates the e-commerce business to contribute 50% of sales by the end of 2023. Through the plan, the company expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and strong operating cash flow.Story continuesWrapping UpAlthough inflation-led sluggish demand is a concern, Gap looks well-placed for further growth on the back of its Athleta brand, cost-saving efforts and Power Plan 2023. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% raise optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked stocks you may want to consider, Urban Outfitters URBN, DICK’S Sporting Goods DKS and Ulta Beauty ULTA.Urban Outfitters, a leading lifestyle product and services company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

574,8b6c0d1c-5cc9-388d-902a-5cc91b43afa8,CSCO,2023-04-12,How Cisco Employees Are Involved With Community Impact,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-employees-involved-community-impact-132500993.html,1681219500,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 11, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.The following is an excerpt from the 2022 Cisco Purpose Report, published on December 8, 2022.Encouraging Cisco employees to contribute to their local and global communities is one way we bring our purpose to life.In fiscal 2022, for the third year in a row, we maintained over 80 percent employee participation in community impact. We measure impact by employees' actions, including advocating for causes they care about; environmental sustainability actions; hybrid volunteering (virtual and in-person); donating; digital give-back experiences; survey sharing; and participating in programs that positively impact people, society, and the planet. The fact that we have engaged four out of every five Cisco employees, representing 95 countries, for the past three years-even throughout a global pandemic-is proof of a purpose-driven culture where small acts of kindness can add up to incredible impact.Principles of behavioral science and economics and data-forward insights drive our strategy and allow all employees to contribute, no matter where they are. For example, we use nudges like giving all new hires a credit to donate to a nonprofit of their choice and integrating easy give-back actions into digital spaces, meetings, and business events. Now, we are leveraging the power of Webex to increase engagement and help create positive habits. By communicating with a chat bot, employees can make donations and pledges directly in chat. With a digital widget, anyone can more easily track Cisco's and their team's participation, anytime, anywhere.Community impact continues to be an integral part of Cisco's Conscious Culture. Our ELT integrates community impact into their business operations, reinforcing their commitment to supporting communities in need and setting the expectation that community impact is a business imperative. In addition, many of our Global Inclusive Communities have their own impact goals and participate in giving. As we've transformed our approach to giving back over the years, we are uniquely positioned to share strategies and outcomes with others through forums like the Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship. This allows us to accelerate and multiply impact for good.Story continuesEngaging employees in supporting equal rights for allAs part of Social Justice Action 1, Influence Ecosystem, which seeks justice and equal rights for AA/B people by supporting nonprofits and policy change, community impact partnered with Cisco's Connected Black Professionals (CBP) Inclusive Community to create the Power to Empower Campaign. The campaign encouraged CBP members and other employees to nominate racial equality and social justice nonprofit organizations that were meaningful to them. Through this campaign, over 100 new nonprofits were added to our matching gifts portal so our employees could have their volunteer time and donations matched by Cisco.Additionally, Cisco's Black Equity Grant program (BEG) awards US$500,000 in cash grants each fiscal year to Black-serving and/or Black-led nonprofit organizations who support social justice and racial equity. Through the BEG program, community impact partnered with CBP to identify organizations and distribute US$75,000 in cash grants to five organizations they were passionate about.A journey for a causeThe Camino de Santiago extends for more than 500 miles across northern Spain, attracting tens of thousands of hikers each year. In 2022, 425 Cisco employees, friends, and families from 21 countries came together to train, prepare, and hike the trail-while raising funds for global charities battling cancer. Many employees made use of Time2Give, the 10 days of time off each employee receives to volunteer, to take part. In total, employees raised more than €100,000 for cancer charities in nine European countries. The experience was an opportunity for colleagues to connect after an extended time apart-as well as to make a positive impact on people and the environment throughout the journey. Watch a video of the event above.Engaging employees on sustainabilityCisco encourages employees to contribute to environmental sustainability. We have numerous programs and platforms through which people can access resources, get inspiration and share ideas (learn more in the ESG Reporting Hub). In fiscal 2022, we launched Sustainability Central, an internal site that provides information on Cisco's commitment to sustainability, resources for sales teams, and sustainability news and highlights from across the business. We also began a new Sustainability Ambassadors program to train employees to represent Cisco's global sustainability strategy and portfolio internally and to customers, partners, and other external stakeholders. Over 60 employees became Cisco Sustainability ambassadors during the initial launch of the program.Employees continue to participate in 24 Green Team Networks (Global Inclusive Communities focused on driving sustainability impacts) and join in our annual Earth Day celebration, Earth Aware, that culminates in SustainX each year. And for the first time since the pandemic began, we were able to host an in-person Recycle IT Day for the 25th anniversary of this event, during which employees brought in used electronics for recycling. During the event, we collected 128 metric tonne of equipment from 100 sites around the globe.To grow awareness and inspire employees to contribute to Cisco's circular economy transformation, we publish a quarterly circular economy newsletter (which is now a sustainability newsletter), manage a circular economy Webex space, and have embedded trainings across key groups at Cisco. In fiscal 2022, our newsletter readership grew by 20 percent, and over 5500 employees in the design community were trained on incorporating Circular Design Principles into their roles.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/748532/How-Cisco-Employees-Are-Involved-With-Community-Impact]"
575,699072e3-b97a-3d13-a24f-eb06fd2d364f,CSCO,2023-04-12,Cisco still faces caste bias suit; engineers' case dismissed,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-still-faces-caste-bias-224426444.html,1681166666,STORY,['CSCO'],"[The California Civil Rights Department has voluntarily dismissed its case alleging caste discrimination against two Cisco engineers, while still keeping alive its litigation against the Silicon Valley tech giant.The two Cisco supervisors, Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella, were accused in the department’s lawsuit of discriminating and harassing an employee on the basis of caste – a division of people based on birth or descent. That case was dismissed by an order of the Santa Clara Superior County Court last week. The employee belonged to the Dalit community, a group that is at the bottom rung of the caste system which took root and evolved in India and elsewhere in the subcontinent.The Civil Rights Department sent a statement to The Associated Press on Monday saying the case against Cisco ""remains ongoing.”“We will continue to vigorously litigate the matter on behalf of the people of California,” it said, adding that it remains committed to “securing relief and ensuring company wide, corrective action.”A Cisco spokesperson declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.California’s lawsuit against Cisco, filed in July 2020, alleges that the Dalit engineer received less pay and fewer opportunities and that the defendants retaliated against him when he opposed “unlawful practices, contrary to the traditional order between the Dalit and higher castes."" The engineer worked on a team at Cisco’s San Jose headquarters with Indians who all immigrated to the U.S. as adults, and all of whom were of high caste, the lawsuit stated.The caste system in India and other South Asian countries, as well as the diaspora, places Dalits at the bottom of a social hierarchy. In 1948, a year after independence from British rule, India banned discrimination on the basis of caste, a law that became enshrined in the nation’s constitution in 1950.The lawsuit against Cisco and its engineers fueled a movement against caste discrimination led by groups such as Oakland, California-based Equality Labs. This lawsuit has also been named in groundbreaking actions including the first-in-the-nation ordinance passed by the Seattle City Council in February to include caste in its anti-discrimination laws. Last month, California State Sen. Aisha Wahab proposed a bill, which if it passes, could make the state the first in the nation to outlaw caste-based bias.Story continuesThe South Asian community has been sharply divided on this issue. Some groups such as Hindus for Human Rights and Hindus for Caste Equity say such a safeguard is necessary to protect vulnerable community members from caste-based discrimination in housing education and the tech sector where many hold key roles. Advocates and other groups say caste discrimination is pervasive in several South Asian communities and the diaspora, across religious lines.However, other organizations such as the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus of North America oppose such policies arguing that they will specifically target Hindus and Indian Americans who are commonly associated with the caste system. These groups also maintain that there is no clear data to show that such discrimination exists, and that caste is covered under “national origin” making it unnecessary to carve out a separate protected category.The Civil Rights Department voluntarily dismissing its case against the two engineers is a vindication for activists who have held the position that “the state has no right to attribute wrongdoing to Hindu and Indian Americans simply because of their religion or ethnicity,” said Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation.“Two Indian Americans endured a nearly three year nightmare of unending investigations, a brutal online witch hunt and a presumption of guilt in the media,” she said.Thenmozhi Soundararajan, founder and executive director of Equality Labs, a Dalit-led advocacy group, said last week’s action “does not change anything” including the fact that the Cisco case “has given so many Dalits the courage to come forward with their stories about caste discrimination in education, the medical and tech industries.”“This is not a loss, but progress,” she said. “The Dalit community owes (the engineer) and the Civil Rights Department gratitude for having the courage to bring such a historic case forward.”A mediation conference between Cisco and the California Civil Rights Department has been set for May 2.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.
