VRSK employs a robust growth strategy, emphasizing organic growth, product development and acquisitions. Its expertise in predictive data analytics and decision support solutions provides a competitive advantage. The company actively acquires and invests in global companies to expand its data and analytics capabilities. Additionally, it consistently rewards shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.VRSK gained 33.4% in the past six months, outperforming its industry’s 15.5% growth and the S&amp;P 500 composite’s 6.2% rise in the same time frame.How is VRSK Doing?Verisk's growth strategy includes organic growth, product development, and acquisitions, with a 1% CAGR in revenues over five years. It invests in people, data, tech and complementary businesses to stay current in the markets, with a focus on solution penetration, proprietary data, predictive analytics, and diversification.Verisk Analytics, Inc. Price Verisk Analytics, Inc. PriceVerisk Analytics, Inc. price | Verisk Analytics, Inc. QuoteAcquisitions play a vital role in Verisk's growth strategy, as it consistently invests in global companies to enhance its data and analytics capabilities across various sectors. The acquisition of Opta in March 2022 is set to extend its presence in the Canadian market, while the purchase of Automated Insurance Solutions is anticipated to bolster its automation capabilities in claims processing and support geographical expansion. The 2022 acquisition of Infutor Data Solutions, LLC (Infutor) strengthened Verisk's marketing solutions portfolio, helping it cater to diverse industries, including insurance.Verisk's current ratio at the end of second-quarter 2023 was pegged at 1.07, higher than the current ratio of 0.89 reported at the end of the prior quarter and 0.56 at the end of the year-ago quarter. It indicates that the company is not likely to have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.Story continuesVerisk consistently rewards shareholders, paying dividends of $195.2 million and repurchasing $1.7 billion in shares in 2022. In 2021, it paid $188.2 million in dividends and bought back $475 million in shares. In 2020, the company distributed $175.8 million in dividends and repurchased $348.8 million in shares. These actions underscore the commitment to shareholder value and confidence in the business.Verisk relies on vast data, facing operational risks like security breaches, contractual disputes with external data suppliers (some rivals), and potential data theft by third-party contractors, risking credibility, customers, and its core existence.In 2022 and 2023, Verisk divested its Energy and Specialized Markets segment and Financial Services segment, leaving only the Insurance segment. While this sharpens its focus on insurance, it raises concerns about reliance on a single service, reducing diversification. Companies with multiple service offerings are generally seen as more secure due to their diversified business.VRSK carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other top-ranked stocks from the Business Services sector:DocuSign DOCU has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four trailing quarters and has an earning surprise of 25.6%.

It had been planning on workforce reduction at Credit Suisse post its acquisition in order to save costs. The company expects that during the integration of Credit Suisse more staff would leave on their own accord.Such job cuts are being planned by UBS as it aims to achieve gross cost reductions of more than $10 billion by the end of 2026.Of the total layoffs, 1,000 employee reductions will be initiated in the later part of 2024. In an attempt to restructure Credit Suisse, the 2,000 staff redundancies will take place.Notably, UBS Group AG completed the acquisition of Credit Suisse in an all-share deal on Jun 12, 2023. UBS aims to substantially complete the integration process by the end of 2026. Cumulative integration-related expenses are expected to be broadly offset by accretion-to-par effects of approximately $12 billion related to fair value adjustments applied to amortized-cost financial instruments.However, since UBS’ emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, it has been facing legal hassles and operational challenges. The company has been facing class action suits and complaints from individual shareholders and former employees of Credit Suisse over an inadequate consideration of the latter.Also, the acquisition of Credit Suisse has attracted its litigation portfolio. Per a Bloomberg article that cited people with knowledge of the matter, UBS is likely to face millions of dollars in regulatory fines over Credit Suisse’s dealings with Archegos Capital Management.Nonetheless, management believes that full integration of Credit Suisse will be the most beneficial option for the company in the upcoming period.UBS Group AG’s shares have gained 24.5% on NYSE over the past six months against the industry’s decline of 1.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUBS sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW has also been taking similar steps to reduce costs.Story continuesEarlier this month, SCHW announced a business streamlining plan as part of its cost-saving measures.

2,60d24e3a-d0e7-3080-ab2c-c9920ac0a558,SCHW,2023-09-02,Is Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio (SWEGX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-markettrack-allocation-equity-portfolio-110005476.html,1693566005,STORY,['SCHW'],"[There are plenty of choices in the Mutual Fund Equity Report category, but where should you start your research? Well, one fund that might be worth investigating is Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio (SWEGX). SWEGX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is responsible for SWEGX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio made its debut in May of 1998, and since then, SWEGX has accumulated about $760 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 7.63%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 12.67%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWEGX's standard deviation comes in at 17.72%, compared to the category average of 17.13%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 19.09% compared to the category average of 18.44%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.99, which means it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -3.89, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SWEGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 0.85%. From a cost perspective, SWEGX is actually cheaper than its peers.Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab MarketTrack Allocation Equity Portfolio ( SWEGX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Don't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Qorvo Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Fall Y/YQorvo reported healthy first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with the bottom and the top line beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Demand softness in various end markets, owing to macroeconomic challenges and inventory adjustments, resulted in lower revenues year over year. However, positive demand trends for IoT connectivity solutions and design wins in defense, automotive and radar applications cushioned the top line.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, the company reported a net loss of $43.6 million or a loss of 44 cents per share against a net income of $68.9 million or 65 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The loss was primarily attributable to lower net sales year over year.Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $33.6 million or 34 cents per share, down from $238.4 million or $2.25 per share in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 19 cents.RevenuesQuarterly revenues declined to $651.2 million from $1,035.4 million in the year-earlier quarter. Despite tailwinds in defense, aerospace and automotive, weak demand in 5G infrastructure, customer inventory adjustments and underutilization of production capacity impeded revenue growth in the quarter. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $640 million.Net sales in High-Performance Analog (HPA) were supported by multiple design wins across diverse market segments, including defense programs extending multiple years. The company secured a multi-million-dollar order for silicon carbide power devices supporting AI servers and other data center applications. Strength in automotive and radar systems enhanced the top line from this vertical. Non-GAAP operating margin in the HPA segment was 17% during the quarter.Connectivity and Sensors Group (CSG) witnessed solid demand trends of highly-integrated IoT connectivity solutions, Wi-Fi 7 RF front ends and force-sensing touch sensors. The company secured multiple deals for Wi-Fi 7 BAW filters. It achieved Matter 1.1 certification, which significantly boosted Qorvo’s market opportunity among top smart home ecosystem customers. For the CSG segment, the non-GAAP operating margin was negative 20%.Net sales in Advance Cellular were supported by healthy traction from leading smartphone manufacturers. Non-GAAP operating margin for the segment was 11%.Story continuesOther DetailsOn a GAAP basis, gross profit declined to $229.1 million from $375.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.9%, down from 50% reported in the prior-year quarter.

It expects revenues to be higher than fiscal 2023 levels, with non-GAAP gross margin of 44%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Qorvo has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C.

(NYSE:TMO) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.46bUS$9.22bUS$10.2bUS$10.9bUS$11.5bUS$12.0bUS$12.4bUS$12.8bUS$13.2bUS$13.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.16%Est @ 4.26%Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.87%Est @ 2.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$7.9kUS$8.1kUS$8.3kUS$8.3kUS$8.2kUS$8.0kUS$7.7kUS$7.5kUS$7.2kUS$6.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$78bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.2%) = US$287bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$287b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$146bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$224b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$557, the company appears about fair value at a 2.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.963. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Thermo Fisher ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

7,d92ef825-ef56-35d5-84f5-be181c89433d,USB,2023-09-02,Should You Invest in U.S. Bancorp (USB) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-u-bancorp-usb-based-133005513.html,1693575005,STORY,['USB'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about U.S. Bancorp (USB) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.U.S. Bancorp currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.95, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.95 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 47.6% and 9.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for USBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for USBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for U.S. Bancorp here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying U.S. Bancorp, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is USB a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for U.S. Bancorp, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.1% over the past month to $4.36.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for U.S. Bancorp.

Shares have lost about 5.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CF due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.CF Industries' Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Sales MissCF Industries reported second-quarter 2023 earnings of $2.70 per share, down from $5.58 in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15.Net sales fell around 47.6% year over year to $1,775 million in the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,850 million.Segment ReviewNet sales in the Ammonia segment decreased 53% to $525 million in the reported quarter, higher than our estimate of $518.5 million. Ammonia adjusted gross margin per ton decreased in first-half 2023 from the year-ago period due to lower average selling prices partly offset by lower realized natural gas prices.Sales in the Granular Urea segment fell 44.8% year over year to $460 million, lower than our estimate of $460.2 million. Granular urea adjusted gross margin per ton decreased in first-half 2023 from the year-ago period mainly due to a decline in average selling prices partly offset by lower realized natural gas prices.Sales in the Urea Ammonium Nitrate segment fell around 43.9% year over year to $548 million, lower than our estimate of $606.9 million. Adjusted gross margin per ton decreased in first-half 2023 from the year-ago period mainly due to reduced average selling prices partly offset by a decline in realized natural gas prices.Sales in the Ammonium Nitrate segment fell around 58.9% year over year to $104 million, lower than our estimate of $146.8 million. Adjusted gross margin per ton decreased in first-half 2023 from the year-ago period due to lower average selling prices partly offset by the impact of using lower-cost imported ammonia for ammonium nitrate production in the U.K. and reduced realized natural gas prices.Story continuesFinancialsAs of Jun 30, CF Industries’ cash and cash equivalents were $3,219 million compared with $2,323 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Long-term debt was $2,967 million at the end of the quarter compared with $2,965 as of Dec 31, 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities was $712 million in the reported quarter, down nearly 19.9% year over year.OutlookAccording to CF Industries, the global nitrogen supply-demand balance will continue to be positive owing to robust demand from agricultural and forward energy curves displaying an elevated cost curve. Energy price differences between major producers in North America and minor producers in Europe and Asia continue to be significantly higher than historical levels. These stronger differentials are expected to last for a considerable amount of time, based on forward energy curves. According to the company, there will continue to be considerable margin opportunities for low-cost North American producers on the back of the global nitrogen cost curve.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -11.22% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, CF has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, CF has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$517 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$464. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cintas' current trading price of US$505 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cintas’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas What's The Opportunity In Cintas?The stock is currently trading at US$505 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 28% compared to my intrinsic value of $395.30. This means that the opportunity to buy Cintas at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Cintas’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Cintas generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Cintas' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 34%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CTAS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe CTAS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CTAS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for CTAS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Though U.S. student debt repayments will resume on Oct. 1, straining many Americans' budgets, 2023 is expected to be the most expensive back-to-school shopping season yet. The National Retail Federation, a retail trade group, predicts spending will surpass $135 billion, an increase of more than $24 billion from last year.""Despite any financial economic challenges, consumers are finding a way to buy the products and services they want,” said Chip West, a retail and consumer behavior expert at Vericast.Jorts, denim jean shorts, ""are the trend that never seems to die,” said Melissa Cohen, former vice president of production at Polo Ralph Lauren and founder of MBC Consulting Solutions. “They are unquestionably one of the hottest apparel items for teens and tweens.”Social media influencer Nikki Mcneri from Georgia also links the rise of jorts to the weather. ""People don't want to stop wearing their perfect jorts of the summer and the weather is still hot.” Mcneri has bought jorts from thrift stores or Urban Outfitters with prices ranging from $5 to $90. The U.S. experienced record-breaking temperatures this summer, sparking forest fires, water shortages and a rise in heat-related hospital admissions. Scientists have linked the extreme weather to human-induced climate change. The popularity of transparent backpacks this year is linked to security concerns of children carrying weapons, as a small but growing number of U.S. schools are requiring them.“The larger the school, the more they are needed,” said Leslie Sparacello, a school superintendent in Austin, Texas, whose former school required clear backpacks. “The problem seems to be that the plastic is not as durable as the other materials,"" she said, adding some schools prefer mesh.Story continuesClear backpacks available on Amazon.com's marketplace are priced starting at $9.97, according to its website.Calvin McDonald, CEO at Lululemon, an athletic apparel company based in Canada, said on Thursday that bags were among the top sellers this quarter without specifically mentioning clear book bags. Its Clear Backpack Mini, priced at $68, was ""sold out"" online in the U.S. as of Friday, according to its website.Major retailer Walmart said back to school items were selling ""ahead of plan"" during its most recent quarter through July. A spokesperson said Walmart has recorded an increase in demand for clear backpacks in the last two back-to-school seasons, specifically in Texas, Florida and Mississipi. The company has a separate section for clear backpacks under its backpack category starting at $4.89.Even in schools that do not regulate see-through backpacks, transparent pouches are a big trend as they are more portable from class to class, said expert West.On Tuesday, Matthew Bilunas, chief financial officer at Best Buy, said demand for electronics was ""a little better than we expected,"" adding that back-to-school shopping is ""running a little longer and a little later into the season.""Nearly 70% of back-to-shoppers surveyed in August said they were likely to pick up electronics such as laptops and computer-related accessories, according to the NRF.

The stock started September near its all-time high but closed slightly off the record price at $161.56 on Friday.So far this year, the company's shares are up more than 13%. That's higher than the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (^DJI) year-to-date gain of almost 5% and significantly outpaces Target stock (TGT), which is down nearly 16%.Why Walmart is winning: groceriesAs consumers' wallets remain pinched with inflation, Walmart's expanding grocery business has been its gateway to consumers who are otherwise more cautious about their discretionary spending.""This is where we're seeing that Walmart has the upper hand compared to Target,"" LSEG director of consumer research Jharonne Martis told Yahoo Finance Live. ""They've gained those loyal customers because of groceries, and now that's converting into them extending themselves and buying general merchandise.""In the retail giant's second quarter earnings results, Walmart posted same-store sales that rose 6.3%, more than the 4.04% expected, according to data from Bloomberg.Foot traffic also increased for Walmart, up 2.8%, along with a higher ticket and online sales in the quarter.On a call with investors, CEO Doug McMillon called its customers ""resilient.""""They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them,"" McMillon said. ""We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories.""Walmart logo is seen on the shop in Williston, United States on June 19, 2023.

""That said, we think it's probably worth monitoring the potentially budding price investments at Kroger and Albertsons.""Goldman also noted that Target's pricing premium is down to 6% from 8% in May and June.""That's the lowest gap versus Walmart since November 2019 (the typical gap has been 8-10%),"" Goldman said.

Here some of Yahoo Finance Live's top takeaways.Lower income households are feeling recessionary, as recent earnings reports from retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe’s (LOW) show a cautious consumer, as they pull back on big-ticket spending and shift to spending on services versus goods. Yahoo Finance’s Brad Smith notes ""consumers are continuing to be extremely judicious"" about where they’re purchasing items.The July JOLTS report showed that the number of job openings slipped to 8.8 million in July, which fell short of the expected 9.5 million.Companies such as Dollar General (DG), Five Below (FIVE), and Nordstrom (JWN), all said they are feeling the impact of shrink hitting their bottom lines.Barbie, Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance World Tour,’ and Taylor Swift ‘Eras Tour’ have had quite the impact on the economy, as they benefit from the consumer shift in spending on services over goods.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, speaking of things being busy, a busy week for corporate earnings and economic data. As we enter the first trading day of September, let's recap some of the biggest lessons that we learned this week.First up, lower income households are feeling recessionary. I mean, we're seeing people really pulling back more than ever. We heard in the earnings calls. We know that people are really bracing for what we're seeing with student loan repayments set to start back up. And so I think every little seed that's being planted, is saying, look the consumer has run out of that pandemic money, they're trading down or trading off some of these more expensive things.And then when you factor in, when you look at those big gas prices on top of everything else, it's just-- it's a very tough time for the consumer right now. And it's starting to show up in some of the price action.BRAD SMITH: One of the acknowledgments from BlackRock, the lower income parts of the economy are certainly feeling a little bit more of the pressure, especially considering the extent to which inflation has needed to be combated to this point. And particularly, BlackRock's Rick Rieder who had said off the back of Fed Chair Jay Powell's commentary even-- and Jackson Hole recently saying that the higher rates right now is an overly regressive tax on lower income households and consequently expands the income and wealth gap in the country here.Story continuesAnd if there's anything that you've looked across, many of the details that have come forward over the course of this retail earnings season is that consumers are continuing to be extremely judicious about where they're purchasing big ticket appliances, where they're purchasing televisions even, or even the types of clothes or apparel that they are buying. And so that particularly is of note and could spell out a little bit more of how consumers across income levels are thinking about their spends, even amid this shift to services spending as well, which we'll get to in a hot second.But one of the other things that we've tracked over this most recent month here, the number of job openings, that slipped. And we saw this show up in the most recent JOLTS reading. We got that at the tail end of August. And perhaps something for the Fed to pay attention to here is that it's now taking us to, I believe, the lowest level of openings since mid-2021 here. So that particularly, and I think, it was, to be exact, July of 2021 and thereabouts.And so ultimately, as we think about where more of those jobs are still continuing to need to be added on, it is in a lot of the more labor intensive parts of the economy, and that showed up in today's employment situation as well, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. And I mean, I remember at the beginning of the year, we talked about some of these layoffs that we were seeing in tech. That's still continuing to happen. I mean, we spoke Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray, &amp; Christmas earlier this week. And he said, so far this year, employers announced plans to cut 481,900 jobs. That's a 203% jump, compared to the first seven months of last year.So we're still continuing to see this cutting of jobs. We also talked about this quiet cutting, where we're also seeing people getting reassigned into other jobs as well. And that's not necessarily showing up in the jobs data, but showing some of the minimizing that we're seeing. And as we were just talking about with our guest here, a lot of these companies doing well. But it's because of some of these cost-cutting measures that are showing up in some of these job cuts, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Spot on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And then, of course, I also want to shift gears because we're also seeing shrinkflation hitting Brick &amp; Mortar retailers. I mean, we heard from retailers reporting, all this week and last week as well shrink, whether that's from mostly that we're seeing from theft or from damage, continuing to bite that bottom line there, Brad.BRAD SMITH: I mean-- and it's across retailers. You've got it at the high end, you've got it at mid, and then also at the lower side. You heard this from Dollar General. You also heard this from Target who many of us have perhaps had some type of shopping experience at, where you walk up to even just get some body wash. You're just trying to stay clean and hygienic at home. And you still got to wait for somebody to walk over after you wave your hand, wand your hand in front of a sensor for them to come open it up for you. That's a change in experience and the customer experience there.And then even at the top end and for Nordstrom, what we saw in the more viral video, they acknowledged that on their earnings call. And so it's really across the spectrum that shrink is impacting many of these retailers as it was brought up on all of these conference calls in one form or another and changing the way that they think about their inventory management, especially in store as well.But even as we're thinking about those shopping for goods out there, the shift has really been into services, Rachelle. Of course, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Greta Gerwig's movie, ""Barbie,"" they are benefiting amid a consumer spending shift. And I don't know if you got dressed up to go see ""Barbie"" movie like I did, Rachelle. But I know you actually did go see Beyonce, so you're part of that shift.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I contributed to both the ""Barbie"" economy and the Beyonce economy. I already own a lot of pink. But yes, even when I knew the ""Barbie"" movie was coming out, I made sure I had my lovely, giant, pink Telfar bag. I was all the way ready. And so it's really a decision that we're seeing that people are being very discerning about what they're spending on. They might not spend as much on other things, but they are prioritizing certain things.I was not about to give up Beyonce tickets. I was like, I'd never seen her perform. It's one of those things where it's that revenge spending. It's like, look, if I'm going to spend on something, it better be something that's worth it.BRAD SMITH: Look, I agree with you. They almost got me. I almost bought some tickets to see Beyonce in Houston because where else to see the Queen Bee than her hometown? So I don't know. But I almost was part of both the travel spending economy and then, additionally, the concert and just making sure that you're enjoying the experience part of the economy as well. So I almost got got. But ultimately, it probably would have been a great time too. It hasn't happened yet. So maybe I can go get it at some point. I don't know. It's too expensive for me.]"

In this regard, acquisitions of Bonobos, Moosejaw and Parcel; partnership with Shopify and Goldman Sachs; delivery programs like Walmart + and Express Delivery; and investment in online e-commerce platform Flipkart are noteworthy. These position the company to keep pace with the changing retail ecosystem and stay firm in the presence of rivals like Amazon and Target. Markedly, Walmart’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.Since being added to the Zacks Focus List on May 30, 2017 at $78.13 per share, shares of WMT have increased 108.13% to $162.61.16 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.21 to $6.42.

18,a3e10827-81f4-333b-8404-92f1688e63d1,JWN,2023-09-02,Gen Z more likely to make purchases based on social media: Survey,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gen-z-more-likely-purchases-152952032.html,1693582192,VIDEO,"['KSS', 'ANF', 'JWN']","[A recent survey from Charles Schwab shows more U.S. consumers are using social media to make purchasing decisions. The biggest group is Gen Z, of which 55% said they make shopping decisions based on what they see from social media posts. Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma explains that using social media to attract Gen Z customers has been a significant strategy for retailers. DiPalma says retailers such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF), Kohl’s (KSS), and Nordstrom (JWN) have all said they are making a push to attract younger shoppers. Retailers continue to want to attract Gen Z because they are “setting the trends” according to Dipalma, who notes that older generations tend to then pick up on those trends.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Social media has a big impact on shopping decisions, according to a recent survey from Charles Schwab. More than half of Gen Z respondents say they made purchases based on what they saw friends and other influencers share on social media. So now retailers are looking to tap into those Gen Z shoppers to drive business. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. Hey, Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: Good morning, Brad. That's right. All retailers want young people. They want them in the stores, they want them to shop online, and they want them to then share their favorites on social media in what many users are calling hauls. Now, one TikTok user that I spoke to, she works in social media marketing. Her name's is Maggie, and she's shared many hauls, from Abercrombie and Fitch hauls to Amazon to Gap to Target hauls, among so many others, and she said that she finds herself so easily influenced from other people's videos, and it makes her feel more justified in her purchasing decisions.Now, retailers certainly looking to tap into that and tap into this generation when they look to spend back to school or just in general as a new season approaches. So forget the loud music, forget the fierce cologne smell, and models at that Abercrombie and Fitch entrance. The CEO telling Yahoo Finance that they hope that they develop loyal customers in their mid to late 20s, especially young millennials that they hope stick around in their 30s and then 40s.Story continuesIn addition to that, we heard from other retailers this past earnings season about the potential that young consumers have. Kohl's, which has struggled in recent years, is now getting a boost in sales as well as foot traffic, saying that their Sephora business, which is located inside the stores, attracts a younger, more diverse crowd that they're hoping to bring in further into the stores. And another one that mentioned consumers, or young consumers, on their call is Nordstrom. They said that it's a bit of a evergreen opportunity, but they said, we do need to do better when it comes to young consumers.And so why do they want this young consumer when they actually have the least amount of savings in their households? Well, they're setting the trends. That's according to one analyst. They said that really, these young people, as we've heard in many years before just now, they felt these cultural touchstones that older generations then pick up on, and now thanks to social media, like we saw before, like these hauls, just one item, if it goes viral, it has the potential to create a tsunami of business not just for these big box retailers, but we've seen small businesses really take off on social media as well.And in addition to that, it really does depend on the situation of a young consumer, but many people in their young 20s don't have a lot of overhead costs, and a lot of them have disposable income that is then going towards buying merchandise, and so it really looks like here Gen Z has the power when it comes to retailers.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true, because, I mean, I'm certainly seeing more-- whether I'm shopping online or in-store, seeing these As Seen on TikTok or I've seen on Instagram things popping up, and they just go flying off the shelves. So then if you're an investor then, how should you be thinking about this?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well, one conversation that we continue to see come up or one stock that we continue to see come up is Lululemon. Of course, they came out with earnings yesterday afternoon, but they're really getting lots of attention from young consumers, and one Barclays analyst that I spoke to said that if you want to jump on a brand that is gaining that social media hype with innovation and new products, you want to think Lululemon.In addition to that, you also want to think Nike. They continue to make strides with young consumers, as well as continuing to diversify their portfolio to meet what's next. Now, if you want to jump into brands that adhere to health and wellness, active lifestyles, you're going to want to think those are on the screen. Think Dick's Sporting Goods, think Lululemon, think Nike, also think Ulta as well.And one more for you, if you want to lean into brands, or invest in brands rather, that are really looking to help Gen Z stretch the dollar as their wallets remain pinched, we want to think of those off-price discount retailers. So we're going to think TJ Maxx as well as Ross Stores. So there's lots of ways to invest in this perhaps newfound behavior of young consumers, but lots of businesses to follow as well.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Appreciate that update, Brooke, there for us. Thank you so much.]"

Here some of Yahoo Finance Live's top takeaways.Lower income households are feeling recessionary, as recent earnings reports from retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe’s (LOW) show a cautious consumer, as they pull back on big-ticket spending and shift to spending on services versus goods. Yahoo Finance’s Brad Smith notes ""consumers are continuing to be extremely judicious"" about where they’re purchasing items.The July JOLTS report showed that the number of job openings slipped to 8.8 million in July, which fell short of the expected 9.5 million.Companies such as Dollar General (DG), Five Below (FIVE), and Nordstrom (JWN), all said they are feeling the impact of shrink hitting their bottom lines.Barbie, Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance World Tour,’ and Taylor Swift ‘Eras Tour’ have had quite the impact on the economy, as they benefit from the consumer shift in spending on services over goods.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, speaking of things being busy, a busy week for corporate earnings and economic data. As we enter the first trading day of September, let's recap some of the biggest lessons that we learned this week.First up, lower income households are feeling recessionary. I mean, we're seeing people really pulling back more than ever. We heard in the earnings calls. We know that people are really bracing for what we're seeing with student loan repayments set to start back up. And so I think every little seed that's being planted, is saying, look the consumer has run out of that pandemic money, they're trading down or trading off some of these more expensive things.And then when you factor in, when you look at those big gas prices on top of everything else, it's just-- it's a very tough time for the consumer right now.

Shares have lost about 4.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Xylem due for a breakout?

Shares have lost about 1.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MetLife due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.MetLife’s Q2 Earnings Beat on Higher Investment ReturnsMetLife reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted operating earnings of $1.94 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.9%. The bottom line, however, declined 5% year over year.Adjusted operating revenues of MetLife amounted to $18,634 million, which increased 3.5% year over year. The top line beat the consensus mark by 8.8%.The better-than-expected second-quarter results were supported by higher investment returns, volume growth across some segments and improved contributions from the U.S. and EMEA businesses. The positives were partially offset by rising expenses and reduced profit levels from MetLife Holdings, Latin America and Asia businesses.Behind the HeadlinesAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfer (PRT), were $11,570 million, up 6% year over year. Adjusted net investment income rose 12% year over year to $5,040 million in the quarter under review, despite decreased real estate equity returns.Total expenses of $16,193 million jumped from $14,486 million a year ago and were 6.2% higher than our estimate, due to rising policyholder benefits and claims, and interest credited to policyholder account balances. The adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT, increased 80 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.6%.Net income plunged 58% year over year to $370 million and missed our model estimate due to net investment losses.

The coup came just hours after it was announced he had won a third term as leader.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The army has since named General Brice Oligui Nguema, former head of the presidential guard, as the country's transitional president.The coup ends a hold on power by the Bongo family of more than five decades. In 2009, Ali Bongo took over the presidency from his father Omar Bongo Ondimba following his death. Omar had ruled the former French colony since 1967.Following the coup, Beijing called on all parties to hold talks while guaranteeing the personal safety of the deposed leader.China, which has investments in Gabon's mining, petroleum and timber industries, hosted President Ondimba when he visited in April. At that time, China-Gabon relations were lifted to a ""comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership"" and Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to help Gabon diversify its oil-dependent economy and build a green belt and road strategy.""China is closely following the developments in Gabon,"" China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. ""We call on relevant sides ... to resolve differences peacefully through dialogue, restore order at an early date [and] ensure the personal safety of President Ali Bongo Ondimba.""Story continuesThe Chinese embassy in Gabon said it had activated the emergency response mechanism and urged Chinese residents to stay indoors.""It is recommended that all Chinese citizens in Gabon stay home and not go out, and in case of emergency, contact the embassy in a timely manner,"" it said on Wednesday.The Chinese statement has stark differences to its reaction to the military coup in Guinea in 2021, probably due to the country's massive source of bauxite for China's aluminium industry. Guinea is also home to the massive Simandou iron ore mine, which is said to have the world's largest untapped reserves of high-quality iron ore at an estimated 2.4 billion tonnes.Soldiers hold transitional president General Brice Oligui Nguema up in celebration after a military coup brought an end to the Bongo dynasty in the Central African country.

Photo: Gabon24 via AP&gt;In September 2021, Beijing opposed the military coup in Guinea and called for an immediate release of then-president Alpha Conde.But China's response in the Gabonese coup is in line with its usual modus operandi of responding to such events, according to Benjamin Barton, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham's Malaysia campus, and not as much of a knee-jerk reaction as it had to Conde being removed from power.""I expect to see China aligning itself with the positions of the African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) in the days to come,"" Barton said.""Naturally, there will be concerns over the well-being of Chinese nationals in Gabon and making sure that the country will remain open for business despite the political and civil upheaval.""Barton said even if the junta starts making specific demands in relation to the economic activities of foreign companies in the country, as was the case in Guinea, China should not be affected.""I fully expect the status quo to remain as the robustness of the Gabonese economy largely depends on demand from its international partners, China included.""Yun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said China's position aligns with that of the African Union, which reflects the region's consensus.Speaking about the wave of military coups in the Sahel, a region of Africa just south of the Sahara, she said some analysts have attributed it to anti-French sentiment and the expansion of Russian influence.""The coups are not seen as [being] in China's interest because the instability inevitably undermines the prospect of economic cooperation and political ties,"" Sun said.The coup is the eighth in the former French colonies of West and Central Africa since 2020. It comes hot on the heels of a coup in July in Niger, where China has petroleum and mining interests, including the building of a 2,000km (1,243 mile) crude oil pipeline from Niger's southeast oilfields to a port terminal in neighbouring Benin.Dr John Calabrese, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said until the coup, the Bongo dynasty had run the country for 56 years.""For a sizeable portion of that period, China has been Gabon's leading trade partner. Importantly, China imports a substantial quantity of manganese ore from Gabon,"" Calabrese said.He said the coup could be viewed as a blow to China in several respects.A torn campaign billboard of ousted Gabon President Ali Bongo Ondimba.

The leader is under house arrest after a military junta seized power in the tiny African nation. Photo: AFP&gt;To begin with, he said, Ali Bongo is a ""known quantity"" for Beijing, someone with whom they have built a strong relationship.""Should the military junta remain in power, Beijing will have to work to [re-]establish ties that will anchor the relationship.""Viewed in the context of the political turmoil and security challenges in the Sahel and elsewhere in West and Central Africa, he said the added instability in Gabon places China's interests at further risk.But there might be a silver lining.""To the extent that the Bongo dynasty's grip on power has been broken and might lead to the further erosion of French influence over its former colony, Beijing's prospects for currying favour with new leadership and extending its influence in the region could conceivably improve,"" Calabrese said.Aly-Khan Satchu, a sub-­Sa­haran Africa geoeconomic ­an­­­­­a­­­­­lyst, said that the coup could eventually work in China's favour.""The diminishing French influence is going to allow for greater Chinese [and Russian] influence in these countries,"" Satchu said.""The Chinese economic model is self-evidently more attractive to Africans than the French model.""China is Gabon's largest trading partner with two-way trade reaching US$4.55 billion in 2022 - up more than 50 per cent year-on-year, according to Chinese customs data.Gabon, with a population of just over two million, is heavily dependent on its oil and minerals, with crude petroleum and manganese ore contributing 83 per cent of the country's revenue.The nation also exports various wood products, but the Gabonese government wants to diversify its economy by attracting more investment into its forestry and tourism industries.Gabon belongs to a small league of countries that absorb more carbon dioxide than they emit, making them ""carbon sinks"". Key to Gabon's forestry industry are a dozen Chinese companies that own forest concessions and more than 30 others that process the wood.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

25,9f252ee2-4ea7-3c45-b739-5556d071f494,O,2023-09-02,A World Running On Empty: The Decline Of Fossil Fuel Supply,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-running-empty-decline-fossil-230000348.html,1693609200,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'HG=F']","[For many years, there has been a theory that imports of oil would become a problem before there was an overall shortage of fossil fuels. In fact, when I look at the data, it seems to be clear that oil imports are already constrained.Figure 1. Interregional trade of fossil fuels based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.As I look at the data, it appears to me that coal and natural gas imports are becoming constrained, as well. There was evidence of this constrained supply in the spiking prices for these fuels in Europe in late 2021 and early 2022, starting well before the Ukraine conflict began.Oil, coal, and natural gas are different enough from each other that we should expect somewhat different patterns. Oil is inexpensive to transport. It is especially important for the production of food and for transportation. Prices tend to be worldwide prices.Coal and natural gas are both more expensive to transport than oil. They tend to be used in industry, in the heating and cooling of buildings, and in electricity production. Their prices tend to be local prices, rather than the worldwide price we expect for oil. Prices for importers of these fuels can jump very high if there are shortages.In this post, I first look at the trends in the overall supply of these fuels, since a big part of the import problem is fossil fuel supply not growing quickly enough to keep pace with world population growth. I also give more background how the three fossil fuels differ.After this introductory material, I provide charts and some analysis of fossil fuel imports and exports by region, based on data from the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy. Theoretically, the total of regional imports should be very close to the total of regional exports. This analysis gives a little more insight into what is going wrong and where.[1] On a worldwide basis, total supplies of both oil and coal seem to be constrained.Figure 2. World consumption of oil, coal, and natural gas based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.Story continuesFigure 2 shows that world supplies of all three fossil fuels follow the same general pattern: They tend to rise in close to parallel lines, with oil supply on top, coal next, and natural gas providing the least supply.The total supply of fossil fuels needs to be shared by the world’s population. It therefore makes sense to look at supply on a per capita basis.Figure 3. World per capita consumption of oil, coal, and natural gas, based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.On Figure 3, the top line, oil supply per capita, is almost perfectly level, suggesting that having a greater supply of oil enables having a larger world population. This relationship makes sense because oil is used to a significant extent in growing today’s food, and shipping it to market. Oil products also make herbicides, insecticides, and drugs for animals that enable the growing supply of food needed to feed today’s population. Oil products are also helpful in road making, and in providing lubrication for machinery of all kinds.We might conclude that oil supply is essential to the growth of human population. It is only by way of a huge change in the economy, such as the one that took place in 2020, that there is a big dip in oil usage. Even now, some of the changes are “sticking.” Some people are continuing to work from home. Business travel is still low. People are still not buying fancy clothing as much as before 2020. All these things help reduce fossil fuel usage, particularly oil usage.Figure 3 also shows that on a per capita basis, coal supply has fallen by 9% since its peak in 2011. This fact, plus the fact that coal prices have been spiking around the world in recent years, leads me to believe that coal supply is already constrained, even apart from the export issue.[2] The share of oil traded interregionally is more than double the share of coal or natural gas traded interregionally.The reason why oil is disproportionately high in Figure 1 compared to Figure 2 is because a little over 40% of oil is shipped between regions. In comparison, only about 18% of coal production is traded with other regions, and about 17% of natural gas production is shipped interregionally. Oil is much easier (and cheaper) to transport between regions than either coal or natural gas. Shipping costs tend to escalate rapidly, the farther either natural gas or coal is shipped.Natural gas has a second problem over and above the high cost of shipping: It requires storage (which may be high cost) if it is not used immediately. Storage is needed for both natural gas and coal because both fuels are often used for heat in winter, either by direct burning or by creating electricity that can be used to heat buildings. Storage for coal is close to free because it can be stored in piles outside.Besides heat in winter, coal is also used to provide electricity for air conditioning in summer, so its demand curve has peaks in both summer and winter. Natural gas is much more of a winter-heat fuel in the US, so it has a large peak corresponding to winter usage (Figure 4).Figure 4. Coal and natural gas consumption by month based on data of the US Energy Information Administration.Storage for natural gas needs to be available in every area where users expect to use it for winter heat. The cost of this storage will be low if there are depleted natural gas caverns that can be used for storage. It is likely to be high if above ground storage is required. Natural gas importing areas often do not have suitable caverns for storage. The easy approach is to try to get by with a bare minimum of storage, and hope that imports can somehow make up the difference.The big question for any fuel is, “Can consumers afford to pay a high enough price to cover all the costs involved in getting the fuel from endpoint to endpoint, at the time it is needed?“Citizens become very unhappy if the cost of winter heat becomes extremely expensive. They demand subsidies and rebates from the government, in order to keep costs down. This is a sign that prices are too high for the consumer.Both coal and natural gas are also heavily used in manufacturing. Their prices vary greatly from location to location and from time to time. If coal or natural gas prices rise in a particular location, the cost of manufactured goods from that location will also tend to rise. These higher prices will particularly hurt a manufacturing country, such as Germany, because its manufactured goods will become less competitive in the world marketplace. GDP growth will be reduced, and the profitably of manufacturers will tend to fall.Because of these issues, long-distance trade in both coal and natural gas tend to hit barriers that may be difficult to see simply by looking at the trend in world production.[3] Natural gas exports may already be becoming constrained, even though the total amount extracted still seems to be rising.A huge amount of investment is needed to make long-distance sale of natural gas possible. Such investment includes:The cost of developing a natural gas field for export use, usually over many years.Pipelines covering every inch traveled by the natural gas, other than any portion of the trip for which transfer as liquefied natural gas (LNG) is planned.Special ships to transport the LNG.Facilities to chill natural gas, so it can be shipped overseas as LNG.Regasification plants, to make the natural gas ready to ship by pipeline after it has been transferred as LNG.Storage facilities, so that sufficient natural gas is available for winter.Not all of these investments are made by the same organizations. They all need to provide an adequate return. Even if “only” very long-distance pipelines are used, the cost can be high.Pipelines work best when there is no conflict among countries. They can be blown up by another country that seeks to raise natural gas prices, or that wants to retaliate for some perceived misdeed. For this reason, most growth in natural gas exports/imports in recent years has been as LNG.Organizations investing in high-cost infrastructure for extracting and shipping natural gas would like long-term contracts at high prices in order to cover their costs. Without a stable long-term supply contract, natural gas purchase prices can be extremely variable. Japan has tended to buy LNG under such long-term contracts, but many other countries have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward prices, hoping that “spot” prices will be lower. They don’t want to lock themselves into a long-term high-priced contract.There are two different things that tend to go wrong:Spot prices bounce up above even what the long-term contract price would have been, creating a huge high-price problem for consumers.Spot prices, on average, turn out to be too low for natural gas exporters. As a result, they cut back on investment, so that the amount of future exports can be expected to fall.I believe that there is a significant chance that natural gas exports are now reaching a situation where prices cannot please all users simultaneously. Not all investors can get an adequate return on the huge investments that they have made in advance. Some investments that should have been made will be omitted. For example, there might be enough natural gas storage for a warm winter, but not for a very cold winter in Europe.A prime characteristic of a fossil fuel (or any resource) that is not economic to extract is that the industry has difficulty paying its workers an adequate wage. Recently, there has been news about a union strike against Chevron at an Australian natural gas extraction site used to provide gas for liquefied natural gas (LNG) export. This suggests that natural gas may already be hitting long-distance export limits. Prices can’t stay high enough for producers to pay their workers an adequate wage.[4] Oil imports by area suggest that the rapidly growing manufacturing parts of the world are squeezing out the imports desired by high-wage, service-oriented countries.Because oil is so important in international trade, I looked at the amounts two ways. The first is based on trade flows, as reported by the Energy Institute:Figure 5. Oil imports by area based on the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.The second is based upon a comparison of reported production and consumption for the same year, using the assumption that if consumption is higher than production, the difference must be attributable to imported oil. The problem with this later approach is that it can easily be distorted by changes in inventory levels. There may also be difficulties with my approach of netting out flows in two different directions, especially if the flows are partly of crude oil and partly of “oil products” of various types.Figure 6. Oil imports based on production and consumption data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute. Amounts adjusted to include “Refinery Gain,” as reported by the US Energy Information Administration.In both charts, imports for China, India, and Other Asia Pacific are clearly much higher in recent years, while imports for the US, Japan, and Europe are down. The peak year for imports (in total) was about 2016 or 2017. Imports were about 3.5 million barrels a day lower in 2022, compared to peak, with both approaches.[5] Oil imports by area indicate that nearly all oil exporters around the globe are having difficulty maintaining export levels.Here, again I show two indications, using the same methods as for oil imports. Since trade is two sided, I would expect total import indications to more or less equal the total of all amounts exported.Figure 7. Oil exports by area using trade flows based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.On Figure 7, peak oil exports (in total) occur in 2016, with the runner up year being 2017. US oil exports are shown to be nearly zero, even in recent years, because US imports and US oil exports more or less cancel out.Figure 8. Oil exports based on production and consumption data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute. Amounts adjusted to include “Refinery Gain,” as reported by the US Energy Information Administration.The indications of Figure 8 show that apart from Canada, the amount of oil exported for all the other export groupings shown is lower in recent years than it was a few years ago. This is also evident in Figure 7, but not as clearly.To some extent, the lower production in recent years is related to the cutbacks announced by OPEC+ (including what I call Russia+). While these cutbacks are “voluntary,” they reflect the fact that based on current oil prices, and based on investments made in recent years, these countries have made the decision to cut back production. No oil exporter would dare mention that it is running short of oil that can be extracted without considerably more investment.On Figures 7 and 8, “Mexico+South” refers to all the oil being produced from Mexico southward. Besides Mexico, this includes Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Columbia, Ecuador, and a number of other small producers. Most of them are experiencing falling production. Brazil is doing a bit better, but it does not seem to be experiencing much growth in exports.Africa’s peak year for oil exports seems to have been in 2007 (both approaches), with recent exports at a much lower level.With respect to Russia+, its exports seem to be down from their peak in 2017 or 2018, but not any more than for oil producers from the Middle East. The European Union oil embargo doesn’t seem to have had much of an impact.The star performer seems to be Canada, with its rising production and exports from the Canadian Oil Sands.In this analysis, I have “netted out” imports and exports. On this basis, the US hasn’t moved into significant oil exporter status yet. I am sure that there are some people hoping that the oil production of the US will continue to increase, but whether this will happen is unclear. The growth of US oil production in recent years has helped offset (and thus hide from view) the falling exports of many countries around the world.[6] Coal exports appear to have peaked about 2016. Europe has reduced its imports of coal, leaving more for other importers.Figure 9. Coal imports by area using trade flows based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.The peak in coal imports seems to have occurred about 2016. In particular, Europe’s imports of coal have fallen significantly since 2006. At the same time, coal imports have risen for many Asian countries, including China, India, South Korea, and Other Asia Pacific. Even Japan seems to have been able to obtain a fairly consistent level of coal imports for the 22-year period shown on Figure 9.Figure 10. Coal exports by area based on trade flow data from the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.One thing that is striking about coal exports is that they are disproportionately from countries in the Far East. Even the coal exports of the US and Canada are from North America’s West Coast, across the Pacific. Russia’s coal exports tend to be from Siberia.The coal exports of South Africa have declined significantly since 2018, and other African countries are eager for their imports. Today’s largest source of coal exports is Indonesia. Coal exports from Russia+, at least until 2021, have been been a source of coal export growth.A major share of the delivered price of coal is transportation cost, which tends to be fueled by oil, particularly diesel. Overland transit is particularly expensive. The real reason for Europe’s decline in coal imports since 2006 (shown in Figure 9) may be that there are practically no affordable coal exports available to it because it is too geographically remote from major exporters. Of course, this is not a story politicians care to tell voters. They prefer to spin the story as Europe’s choice, to prevent climate change.[7] Natural gas imports and exports have only recently started to become constrained.Figure 11. Natural gas exports by area based primarily upon production and consumption data from the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.Figure 11 shows that natural gas exports from Russia+ (really Russia, with a little extra production from other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States) have stayed fairly level, except for a big drop-off in 2009 (probably recession related) and in 2022.The overall level of natural gas exports has been rising because of contributions from several parts of the world. Africa was an early producer of natural gas exports, but its exports have been dropping off somewhat recently as local gas consumption rises.More importantly, exports have increased in recent years from the Middle East, Australia, and North America. With this growing supply of exports, it has been possible for importers to increase their imports.Figure 12. Natural gas imports by area based upon production and consumption data from the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.Europe was able to maintain a fairly stable level of natural gas imports between 1990 and 2018, and even to increase them by 2021. China was able to ramp up its natural gas imports. Even Japan was able to ramp up its natural gas imports until about 2014. It has tapered them back since then. India and Other Asia Pacific both have been able to add a small layer of imports, too.[8] What lies ahead?The countries that have the greatest advantage in using fossil fuel imports are the countries that don’t heat or cool their homes, and that don’t have large numbers of private citizens with private passenger automobiles. Because of their sparing use of fossil fuel imports, their economies can afford to pay higher prices to import these fossil fuel imports than other countries. Thus, they are likely to be winners in the competition for fossil fuel imports.Europe stands out to be an early loser of imports. It is already losing oil and coal imports, and it also seems to be an early loser of natural gas imports. However, for all its talk about preventing climate change, the reduction in European imports of fossil fuels hasn’t made much of a dent in global carbon dioxide emissions (Figure 13).Figure 13. CO2 emissions for Europe and the Rest of the World, based on data of the 2023 Statistical Review of World Energy by the Energy Institute.I am afraid that no country will really come out ahead. In some sense, the United States is better off than many countries because it is producing slightly more fossil fuels than it consumes. But it still depends on China and other countries for many imported goods, including computers. Given this situation, the United States likely cannot continue business as usual for very long, either.By Gail TverbargMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Massive Copper Theft Scandal Sends Shockwaves Through Metal MarketLME's Reputation On The Line After Nickel FiascoInvestigation Into Carbon Offsets Forces Shell To Rethink StrategyRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The real climbed 0.3% after data showed Brazil's economy expanded by 0.9% as robust household demand and strong oil and mining output boosted activity amid the fading effect of a bumper harvest. The data was a welcome surprise for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is betting on economic expansion to help pay for more generous social programs under new fiscal rules, with Finance Minister Fernando Haddad expecting economic growth to stand at around 3% this year. ""We are confident that Brazil is going to continue with its positive GDP and probably higher than what markets are pricing in,"" said Eduardo Moutinho, market analyst at Ebury, betting on a strong labor market and service sector performance. Meanwhile, Brazil's monetary policy director Gabriel Galipolo noted that an improvement in fiscal situation is ""relevant"" for bringing inflation expectations closer to target. Top exporter Colombia's peso gained over 1%, helped by strong crude oil prices. A Reuters survey showed Colombia's inflation will have continued its downward trajectory in August on a stronger currency, but not enough to induce rate cuts in September. Capping gains in the region, the dollar edged higher after the U.S. jobs report showed a still-strong labor market, despite some signs of deterioration. Chile's IMACEC economic activity index rose 1.8% in July year-on-year, sharply above expectations of a 0.9% increase. Also helped by higher copper prices, top producer Chile's peso gained 0.1%, but off the day's high. All eyes will be on the country's central bank decision next week after having kicked off its policy easing cycle in July with a 100-basis-point cut. Meanwhile, Peru's annual inflation slowed further in August - with the key index based on the metropolitan region of Lima reaching its lowest in almost two years - despite higher-than-expected monthly consumer prices growth. Ebury's Moutinho expects Peru to follow Chile and Brazil and kick off its policy easing soon. Peru's sol was down 0.3%. The Mexican peso remained under pressure, down 0.3%, after the Foreign Exchange Commission on Thursday announced the reduction of its exchange hedging program. Meanwhile, data showed Mexico in July brought in a little over $5.65 billion in remittances, one of its main sources of foreign currency and a pillar of household spending, edging near the monthly record of close to $5.70 billion it hit in May.

The investment banking giant is facing allegations of reverse discrimination after firing a white executive. Credit: Victor J. Blue/BloombergA former Morgan Stanley executive claims to be the victim of reverse discrimination in a lawsuit accusing the firm of wrongful termination after he was replaced by a colleague who's a Black woman.The suit, filed this week in federal court in the Southern District of New York, was brought by a white executive named Kevin Meyersburg, who was Morgan Stanley's head of executive services until May.Meyersburg accuses the Wall Street investment bank of violating civil rights statutes protecting against workplace discrimination, including the New York State Human Rights Law and the New York City Human Rights Law.The former executive's termination ""was the result of the firm's attempt to comply"" with internal hiring and promotion policies aimed at diversifying employment, according to the complaint.Meyersburg is requesting that Morgan Stanley be ordered to reinstate his position and pay damages.A Morgan Stanley spokesperson declined to comment.The complaint states that Meyersburg, who previously spent 15 years at E*TRADE, was in charge of a profitable wealth management business when Morgan Stanley ended his employment.The Executive Services group he led managed around $5 billion in assets and added 3,000 new accounts during Meyersburg's tenure, according to the complaint.In May, during a meeting with his boss, Meyersburg was ""confused and bewildered"" after learning that his employment was being terminated and that the managing director of Morgan Stanley's financial wellness team would take leadership of the Executive Services group, the complaint states.The suit alleges that the executive who replaced Meyersburg was less qualified for the position.Meyersburg's boss informed him ""that the termination decision was not based on his performance but could not explain to Meyersburg why the decision had been made,"" the complaint states.Lawyers representing Meyersburg cited a 2021 Morgan Stanley diversity and inclusion report in which the firm committed to ""improving representation"" in its workforce.Story continuesEmployee demographic metrics — including hiring, promotion and compensation data — are reviewed regularly ""to identify gaps, shape our strategy and goals, and evaluate progress against those goals,"" the report stated.Louis Pechman, a lawyer representing Meyersburg, said in an email that Morgan Stanley firing his client and promoting a minority employee is ""irony,"" considering Meyersburg's efforts to expand diversity at the firm.Meyersburg helped run an internal program called Inclusive Leadership, and his Executive Services team at Morgan Stanley scored highly on an annual survey gauging employee feedback about the firm's core values, including diversity initiatives, according to the complaint.""Morgan Stanley unfortunately confused diversity with reverse discrimination. They are simply not the same,"" Pechman said.Sharon Parella, a lawyer who represents employees in disputes with their employers, was critical of the lawsuit.She said that the case appears to have been brought because the Morgan Stanley employee who replaced Meyersburg is Black, and that if the logic of the lawsuit were applied broadly, it would result in the end of programs seeking to increase gender diversity, which would likely have little support.""If this can't be done for Black people and people of color, then are we also going to agree to stop all programs on behalf of women and people in other protected categories?"" Parella said.The case against Morgan Stanley comes amid increasing legal challenges to corporate policies that commit companies to initiatives aimed at supporting diversity.Particularly over the last year, politicians and lawyers across the country have taken steps to push back against what has become a new norm in corporate values at many companies.In New Orleans, a federal appeals court is weighing a challenge to the Security and Exchange Commission's approval of a Nasdaq stock exchange rule on corporate board diversity.And in California, a federal judge in May struck down a law that required banks and other companies to appoint a minimum number of board members from underrepresented communities.For Morgan Stanley, the suit represents the flip side of accusations that the firm has recently faced related to diversity. In 2021, Morgan Stanley settled a lawsuit filed by its former chief diversity officer, which alleged that the investment bank was not doing enough to reduce racial bias and discrimination.]"

MUFG and 40% owned by Morgan Stanley MS, has been sued by retail investors in Japan over the sale of the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds issued by Credit Suisse.Investors claim that they were not properly informed of the risks involved in the instrument.In an effort to address customer demand for portfolio diversification, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities sold Credit Suisse’s riskiest bonds earlier this year.However, when UBS Group AG UBS acquired Credit Suisse, bondholders lost everything because $17 billion of the securities were wiped out. Notably, the acquisition of Credit Suisse was announced by UBS in March in an emergency takeover involving government-backed efforts to fend off panic following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Thus, on behalf of 66 plaintiffs, a lawsuit has been filed in the Tokyo District Court, wherein investors are demanding 5.2 billion yen ($36 million) in compensation (the difference between the amount paid for the securities and the interest received on them) from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Per the plaintiffs, the brokerage firm violated a suitability principle by selling the bonds to regular investors even when the products were inappropriate. Moreover, the brokerage did not provide sufficient explanation about the risks associated with the AT1 bonds.Investors claim that Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities kept selling the AT1 bonds to retail clients even after Swiss authorities came up with the prospect of rescuing Credit Suisse after the company’s troubles deepened.Per the complaint, plaintiffs were told that the bonds would be fine as long as Credit Suisse’s key financial health measure stayed at 7% or higher. Also, they were reassured that the debt was safer than equities, which was not true.Notably, bondholders worldwide have been seeking damages from Swiss authorities for their losses.Of the 140 billion yen of notes sold in total, about two-thirds of it was sold by Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Thus, the recent lawsuit has renewed scrutiny on the financial health of Japan.Banks and brokerage firms have gone too far to earn fees by selling risky products to individuals.Escalating expenses because of a persistent rise in salaries and employee-benefit costs have already been hurting MUFG’s bottom-line growth to an extent. With this lawsuit, an increase in legal expenses will likely put added pressure on the company’s financials.Over the past six months, shares of MUFG have gained 14.1% on the NYSE compared with the industry’s 3% rise.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, MUFG carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The average residential user using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month will start paying an extra 14 cents per month, starting in 2024. The surcharge is anticipated by the companies to stay the same in 2025 and to drop to 11 cents per month in 2026. All residential customers of Mon Power and Potomac Edison will be responsible for the additional cost of building the three sites.Details of the ProjectPSC's approval in August 2023, to the companies' proposal to finish three of five planned solar sites marked the beginning of the construction phase. These five locations will produce 50 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, 1 MW of solar energy can power 173 households nationwide on average.The Commission had already given initial clearance for the development, prior to the final permission being granted once the companies secured enough industrial, commercial and residential customers to utilize around 85% of the renewable energy supplied by the sites. These criteria have been satisfied by the three locations that are planned in the counties of Monongalia, Marion and Berkeley. Once consumers sign up for the electricity they will produce, the companies intend to ask the PSC for permission to develop the remaining two solar sites.Transition to Renewable EnergyFirstEnergy is focused on lowering emission levels and has undertaken initiatives for the same. In 2015, FirstEnergy had set a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2045. In November 2020, it updated the target to attain 100% carbon neutrality by 2050, with a mid-term goal of 30% reduction in greenhouse gases within the company's direct operational control by 2030 from the 2019 level.To address its goal, Mon Power and Potomac Edison signed an agreement with the town of Harpers Ferry in West Virginia in January 2023, to advance the use of clean energy. The town has committed to a subscription equal to 100% of its streetlight and town hall energy usage in support of the companies’ generation of solar power.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsPer the U.S. Energy Information Administration report, Renewable energy capacity has been growing rapidly, and it expects this growth to continue because the electric power sector plans to add 27 gigawatts (GW) of new solar generating capacity by the end of 2023 and a further 31 GW in 2024.Other electric power companies like Dominion Energy Inc. D, Duke Energy Corp. DUK and Alliant Energy Corp. LNT are set to benefit from growing solar market in the United States.In August 2023, Dominion Energy unveiled a solar and energy storage project at the Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC, marking the largest renewable energy project ever developed at a U.S. airport. In partnership with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, D plans an 835-acre, 100 MW capacity solar energy on the southwestern edge of the airport, along with a 50-MW energy storage facility.D’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 20%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.3% in the last four quarters.  Duke Energy currently operates 1,200 MW of solar energy in Florida, with plans to continue adding approximately 300 MW a year going forward. To achieve this target, Duke Energy Florida announced two new solar projects in March 2023, as part of Clean Energy Connection, the company's community solar program. Once complete, each 74.9-MW solar facility will generate enough carbon-free electricity to power 23,000 homes.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 6.5%.Alliant Energy is the largest owner-operator of regulated solar energy in Wisconsin. The company plans to add 1.1 GW of solar energy within the state by mid-2024. In August 2023, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved two Alliant Energy battery energy storage projects — the 100-MW Grant County Battery Project and the 75-MW Wood County Battery Project.LNT’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.47%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year improvement of 2.5%.Price PerformanceIn the past year, shares of FirstEnergy have lost 9.6% compared with the industry’s 15.8% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankFirstEnergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks that assure steady returns seems prudent.Q2 GDP Growth Revised, Job Openings NarrowOn Aug 30, The ADP National Employment report showed that private payrolls increased by just 177,000 in August, a lot lower than the upwardly revised reported 371,000 in July. This also missed the consensus estimate of 195,000.This follows the JOLTS report released on Aug 29, which showed that job openings declined to 8.8 million in July, lower than the consensus estimate of 9.5 million. Also, only 3.5 million workers quit their jobs in July, the lowest level in nearly two-and-a-half years.Clearly, the labor market is cooling. Lower job openings mean lower chances of people getting jobs. At the same time, fewer workers quitting their jobs decreases the chance of higher wages, which means lower personal income.In fact, the ADP report mentioned that job stayers saw a pay rise of 5.9% year over year in August, the slowest growth since October 2021.This came as the U.S. second-quarter GDP growth was revised down to 2.1% at an annualized rate from the earlier reported 2.4%.Story continuesConsumer Confidence Takes a HitA slowing economy and sky-high inflation have been denting investors' confidence. The confidence level reflected in Americans in July took a hit in August and declined to 106.1 from July's revised reading of 114, the Conference Board said on Aug 29. Analysts had expected it to touch 116.Moreover, a drop in consumers' assessment of future business scenarios is a distinct indicator that people are experiencing a sense of helplessness concerning an imminent economic downturn.In August, consumers' evaluation of current economic conditions saw a significant decline, plummeting to 114.8 from the previous month's reading of 153. Moreover, their outlook on economic conditions for the upcoming six-month period also deteriorated, dropping to 80.2 this month compared to 88 in July.Although inflation has more than halved over the past 12 months, it still remains elevated and a lot higher than the Fed's target range of 2%. This has made Fed officials maintain their hawkish stance, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicating more interest rate hikes.This is likely to further dent consumer confidence given that borrowing costs are already high after the central bank raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples, and utilities.

The software giant reported growth across all five of its product categories as it continues its growth path fueled by AI. Together with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Salesforce provided a wave of optimism regarding recovery in technology spending for the remaining half of the year.Fiscal Second Quarter HighlightsFor its fiscal second quarter that ended on July 31st, Salesforce generated $8.60 billion in revenue that grew 11% YoY, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $8.53 billion. Salesforce earned a net income of $1.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, improving significantly from last year’s comparable quarter when it earned $68 million, or 7 cents per share. When adjusted, EPS amounted to $2.12, also topping Bloomberg’s estimate of $1.90. Adjusted operating margin amounted to 31.6%, also exceeding Bloomberg’s 28.2% estimate. Free cash flow amounted to $630 million, leaving behind Bloomberg’s estimate of $445.1 million.Lifted Full Year GuidanceFor the undergoing, third, quarter, Salesforce guided for revenue to be in the range between $8.70 billion and $8.72 billion while calling for adjusted EPS between $2.05 and $2.06. Salesforce’s both top and bottom line guidance topped Refinitiv’s estimate of adjusted EPS of $1.83 per share on revenue of $8.66 billion.Moreover, Salesforce lifted its full-year guidance as its adjusted earnings per share outlook is between $8.04 to $8.06 on revenue range between $34.7 billion and $34.8 billion. Back in May, Salesforce anticipated a full year revenue range between $34.5 billion and $34.7 billion. It also raised its full year operating margin guidance from 28% to 30%.The AI WarsDuring the reported quarter, Salesforce introduced AI enhancements to its Cloud applications. Its Sales Cloud and Service Cloud users could get them for a monthly fee of $50 per user. Moreover, Salesforce announced an AI Cloud that will include marketing and data analysis tools, promising to bring trusted generative AI to enterprises. With the power of AI, Salesforce delivered stronger-than-expected second results and lifted its guidance as it provided optimism like Amazon and Google regarding a brighter remaining half of the year. One month ago, Amazon also forecasted a bright third quarter with resilient cloud sales. Aiming to retain its cloud crown, Amazon also answered to AI front-runners, including Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in touting the technology it is able to offer. But no one in the AI game seems scared of its rivals, including Salesforce that is confidently marching ahead into the AI era.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

41,8276805f-f7ca-35e1-96f2-854ea4bda7be,SEE,2023-09-02,There's A Lot To Like About Sealed Air's (NYSE:SEE) Upcoming US$0.20 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-sealed-airs-nyse-121607840.html,1693656967,STORY,['SEE'],"[Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Sealed Air's shares before the 7th of September in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 22nd of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.80 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Sealed Air stock has a trailing yield of around 2.1% on the current share price of $37.29. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Sealed Air can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Sealed Air If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Sealed Air paying out a modest 30% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (78%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Sealed Air's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 54% per annum for the past five years.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Sealed Air has delivered an average of 4.4% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.Final TakeawayIs Sealed Air an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Sealed Air paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Sealed Air looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example - Sealed Air has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

This comprises the sale of the Hush Puppies intellectual property in China, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the sale of the Wolverine Leathers business in the United States. These actions are expected to reshape the company’s portfolio and streamline the organization, thus allowing it to grab meaningful opportunities. This transaction, which is likely to conclude in the coming weeks after being subjected to the satisfaction of the customary closing conditions, will also enrich the shareholders’ value.Wolverine has inked a deal to sell the Hush Puppies trademarks, patents, copyrights and domains in China, Hong Kong and Macau to the present sublicensee, Beijing Jiaman Dress Co., Ltd., for roughly $58.8 million. Per the transaction, these parties have entered into a License and Cooperation agreement for mutual engagement and brand stewardship of the Hush Puppies brand across the region. This will allow the company to own and operate the Hush Puppies brand in the rest of the world.We note that Wolverine has concluded the sale of the U.S. Wolverine Leathers business to its long-time customer, New Balance, for $6 million. The aforesaid moves follow the recently completed sale of Keds to Designer Brands, Inc., as well as the strategic alternatives process for its Sperry brand.What’s More?Management had earlier initiated a 100-day action plan, including a focus on inventory reduction, debt management, Keds sale and the creation of a profit improvement office to grab savings to drive growth. Management expects an incremental $130 million in savings for 2024, which yields a four-year run rate of $200 million. The company looks forward to reinvesting a portion of these savings into brand building and top marketing capabilities, particularly for Merrell and Saucony. It anticipates further inventory improvement in 2024, backed by tighter SKU management and a better operations planning system. Driven by the operational efficiencies and deleverage efforts, management projects net debt to be below $700 million by the end of the next year.Further, the company expects the profit improvement office to generate a minimum of $70 million in savings for 2023. It remains on track to deliver the year-end inventory goal of $520 million. Management also has plans to sell at least $50 million of non-core assets in the next months to pay down debt. Further, the company focuses on the brand structure, increasing efficiency by removing costs, strategic review of its portfolio, and improving working capital and lowering leverage.

Shares have added about 2.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Oil due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Marathon Oil Reports Better-Than-Expected Q2 EarningsMarathon Oil Corporation reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted net income per share of 48 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. The outperformance reflects strong domestic oil and gas production.However, the company’s bottom line fell from the year-ago adjusted profit of $1.32 due to weaker oil realizations and higher production costs in the United States.The company reported revenues of $1.5 billion, which came 0.4% above the consensus mark but fell 34.3% from the year-ago sales of $2.3 billion.Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 399,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 343,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $365 million, down from $846 million in the year-ago period due to lower oil realizations and higher costs, partly offset by stronger production. We modeled the segment income at $378.9 million.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $72.49 per barrel were significantly lower than the year-earlier level of $110.10 and marginally missed our projection of $72.72. Additionally, natural gas liquids’ average price realizations decreased 53.6% to $18.72 a barrel. Finally, average realized natural gas prices plunged 72.4% year over year to $1.89 per thousand cubic feet though it managed to beat our estimate of $1.79.Meanwhile, production costs were $5.88 per BOE, representing a 1.4% year-over-year rise.Net production of 356,000 BOE/d was up 25.8% from second-quarter 2022. Total U.S. output, which came ahead of our projection of 346 BOE/d, comprised approximately 51% oil, or 181,000 barrels per day (bpd).Significantly higher year-over-year production from Eagle Ford favorably affected the company’s quarterly performance, which was partly offset by lower volumes from the Bakken and Oklahoma areas. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 156,000 BOE/d, surging 85.7% from the level in second-quarter 2022, while output from Bakken was 109,000 BOE/d compared with 114,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma output came in at 50,000 BOE/d, down from the year-ago level of 56,000 BOE/d.International E&amp;P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $30 million compared with $160 million in the year-ago period and our projection of $89.2 million. These results could be primarily blamed on lower output.Marathon reported production available for sale of 43,000 BOE/d, down from 60,000 Boe/d in second-quarter 2022 and below our expectation of 49 BOE/d.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $53.64 per barrel reflected a 32.7% deterioration from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2022.Story continuesFinancial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $1.1 billion, $50 million higher than the prior-year period and marginally above our expectations. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the second quarter, down 29.3% from a year ago.As of Jun 30, 2023, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $215 million and long-term debt of 5.7 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 34.2.Marathon Oil spent $623 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $531 million in adjusted free cash flow. The company also executed $372 million in share repurchases during the period.2023 GuidanceMarathon has maintained its budgeted capital spending between $1.9 billion and $2 billion this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to prioritize shareholder returns over production growth. The company is targeting production in the range of 385,000 BOE/d to 405,000 BOE/d, up more than 15% (at the midpoint) from last year. Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 185,000-195,000 barrels per day. Assuming $80 WTI, Marathon Oil expects to return a minimum of 40% of its cash flow from operations.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 9.79% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Marathon Oil has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

Our competitive success is a direct result of our innovation and technology leadership. We're in the early innings of taking market share and mind share of a massive $100 billion addressable market right for disruption. As always, please read our shareholder letter published on the Investor Relations website, which provides more detail.Let's review the details of our second quarter performance, which exceeded our top and bottom line expectations. Our ARR grew by 47% year-over-year to $612 million, reflecting net new ARR of $49 million in the quarter. Our gross margin reached a new record of 77%. Since our IPO just two years ago, we've expanded our gross margin by more than 20 percentage points. We're now opening within our long-term gross margin target range. This important achievement reflects the scalability of our business model, driven by our strong unit economics and price discipline. We're making significant progress in improving our operating and free cash flow margins. We proactively streamlined our cost structure to ensure our path to profitability. Our operating margin expanded by 34 percentage points driven by higher scale and cost discipline.We've delivered margin improvement at a staggering pace. Q2 marked our eighth consecutive quarter of more than 25 percentage points of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Let me also highlight the remarkable improvement we've made to our free cash flow profile delivering 55 percentage points of expansion compared to just a year ago. The level of margin improvements we're delivering is a rarity among public companies with strong liquidity of more than $1 billion in cash and equivalents we will build on this progress. We're confident in achieving positive free cash flow in the second half of our next fiscal year. Looking beyond key financial metrics, our competitive differentiation and superior platform value is resonating with customers.We continue to win in a significant majority of competitive evaluations. Our win rates remain strong, including against large next-gen competitors. Our single platform architecture helps enterprises consolidate spend, point products and consoles. We're addressing the most important needs to enterprises, reducing complexity, streamlining operating efficiency and delivering better security all to AI and automation. I'm especially pleased with the positive feedback from our customers. As captured by Gartner Peer Insights, hundreds of customers provided favorable feedback on the singularity platform. We achieved top two ranking not only DDR, but also in MDR and cloud workload protection categories outperforming even the largest vendors in the space.As evidenced by these results, our technology delivers on our promise to our customers. In Q2, we added about 700 new customers, and our total customer base now exceeds 11,000. Remember that this number does not include the customers served by our MSSP partners, so it is understated, especially as more enterprises turn to MSSPs for minute security services. Customers with more than $100,000 in ARR grew 37% year-over-year, much faster than our total customer growth and customers with more than $1 million in ARR grew even faster. Our momentum with large enterprises and platform adoption continues to drive higher ARR per customer. In Q2, we secured many large customer wins across U.S. federal agencies to global health care companies and technology pioneers spanning both endpoint and cloud footprints.Our singularity platform helps enterprises simplify cybersecurity by consolidating multiple vendors in this jointed platforms. Let me highlight two examples. First, a large enterprise selected our unified platform to replace a total of seven different security vendors, including the two largest endpoint vendors. The security team at this enterprise was grappling with the challenge of managing multiple solutions and consoles. Following hands-on experience, the customer selected our Singularity platform for EDR with five additional modules. Through autonomous protection in a single console, we deliver better security and superior customer experience. In another multimillion dollar win from the quarter, a global health care enterprise selected SentinelOne's unified platform to integrate multiple security ecosystem products and bring them together, replacing the closed garden approach of their incumbent vendor.The customer valued SentinelOne's open platform that unites security data and actions future-proofing their enterprise security posture. Our platform approach continues to be a source of growth through expansion, driving a net retention rate of more than 115%. As a reminder, our NRR now includes legacy products from the acquisition of Attivo networks a year ago. The inclusion of Attivo and macro-driven budgetary constraints are impacting our near-term expansion rate. We believe this is temporary. Over the long-term, we see significant platform expansion potential based on high customer retention rates, expanding product categories and early-stage adoption from our installed base. Our NRR expansion was driven by continued license and module adoption.Singularity cloud remained our fastest-growing solution in Q2 followed by strong contributions from Singularity Data Lake, Vigilance MDR and Ranger. Overall, module adoption remains a meaningful opportunity for growth, and we're beginning to see opportunities for large security data deals and other massive market opportunity that is ripe for disruption. Our platform solutions beyond endpoint continue to drive more than one-third of our quarterly bookings in Q2, illustrating the diversity of our business mix. On to our partner ecosystem. We achieved another quarter of standout growth with our MSSP partners in Q2. Businesses are increasingly turning to managed security to elevate protection, address cybersecurity talent shortages and better align cost structures.Despite recent macro-related industry headwinds, the demand for managed security remains strong. Our large partners continue to expand their business with SentinelOne through additional licenses and modules. In a multimillion dollar deal from the quarter, we quadrupled our business with a fast-growing MSSP partner compared to just a year ago. From the beginning, we've built our business by enabling our partners instead of competing with them. Our differentiated platform capabilities such as multi-tenancy, automation and remote management makes SentinelOne a foundational platform for MSSPs who are building their practices on top of our technology. One of our strategic partners, Pax8, recently recognized SentinelOne's significant impact with its Pax8 Most Valuable Vendor award.We're still in the early innings of a massive business expansion opportunity with our MSSP partners. Overall, our quarterly performance reflects strong execution by our teams. Our proactive efforts to enhance operational efficiencies are showing measurable improvements. We've expedited our deal closed processes and cash collections all while growing the average deal size. Over the last few years, our product portfolio has evolved from endpoint to a broad security platform covering endpoint, cloud identity and data. Similarly, our go-to-market framework is evolving towards a full enterprise-wide security platform. The actions we've undertaken are yielding positive results but there's always more work to be done. As we continue our journey towards surpassing $1 billion in ARR and achieving profitability, our focus remain on continuously sharpening our execution from training and enablement to support and services.We're in a terrific position to disrupt the $100 billion security and data market opportunity, and we're raising our full-year growth and margin guidance to reflect a stronger outlook and better execution. Let's turn the discussion to the market environment and the wave of secular tailwinds behind cybersecurity. Global macroeconomic conditions and the broader demand environment remained consistent with the trends we discussed last quarter. Enterprises continue to rightsize their security investments based on near-term budget constraints. We've seen a proliferation of cyber incidents, new software vulnerabilities and an uptick in the use of AI-based attack methods. The evolving fiber threat landscape and sophistication of moderate attacks have exposed the shortcomings of key cybersecurity vendors and reinforce the structural importance of AI-powered autonomous scalable security.In a recent cyber incident linked to China, attackers gained access to user authentications, opening the door to a range of Microsoft applications and services. In addition to the vulnerability a Microsoft Defender couldn't defend, the hackers were able to use the stolen keys to access government and corporate accounts, it's no surprise. Microsoft Solutions are known to be rated with vulnerabilities which are accompanied by cybersecurity that has been repeatedly breached. Law makers and security experts are questioning the significant shortcomings of Microsoft cybersecurity and are asking for an investigation into the company's security practices. Numerous incidents such as this underscore that inadequate and legacy security solutions are exposing enterprises to enormous cost business disruptions and brand reputation concerns.Increasingly, cybersecurity is an executive and board level priority as governments begin to require high level of oversight and disclosure. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission established new rules to require a public company to regularly disclose matters related to cybersecurity risk and to report material cybersecurity incidents. All of this, once again, shine a spotlight on the structural importance of blazing fast and AI-driven cybersecurity platform as well as the collection and retention of all enterprise log data. In today's evolving threat landscape, point solutions are falling out of favor. Security vendors that focus on a narrow set of data sources or attack vectors are unable to furnish comprehensive and cost-effective protection.Customers are seeking to consolidate not only their security vendors, but also the security consoles and data in order to gain a unified view of the enterprise security landscape. Enterprises need a specialized security approach centered on all enterprise data to prevent attacks. Our autonomous technology brings this vision to life with a unified AI-based security analytics platform that seamlessly aggregates and connects data from all security products to deliver enterprise-wide visibility in a single streamlined technology and interface. We eliminate the need to operate this jointed platforms. As the attacks move beyond a single surface, it's imperative to tie together telemetry logs from key security products. Singularity data lake is the only unified platform in the market that is able to bring together full fidelity logs and visibility from all key sources for enterprise security, like e-mail security, identity access management, firewalls, SaaS providers and others.Frost &amp; Sullivan recently ranked SentinelOne is the XDR Growth Index leader ahead of all the security vendors evaluated. I'm proud of our leading AI-based technology and the innovations we're bringing to customers. Our newly launched vulnerability management solution, Ranger Insights is another example of how we're helping customers eliminate disparate tools in a single platform. Ranger Insight connects two closely tied elements of cybersecurity, application vulnerability identification and endpoint mitigation, which were disconnected until now. CR ranked Ranger Insight as the #1 in their list of cooler security products unveiled at Black Hat 2023. We also introduced a new cloud data security product line, which offers threat detection for customers using cloud storage vendors like Amazon S3 and network storage providers such as NetApp.On top of delivering industry-leading workload protection, we're expanding our cloud security product suite to include capabilities like cloud vulnerability management to asset discovery and visibility, making Singularity Cloud one of the broadest CNA platforms to have end-to-end functionality from runtime protection to data security. Last but not least, building upon our success in delivering best-in-class autonomous security, we're extending our lead by bringing generative AI to security professionals. Purple AI transformed security operations by supercharging users to control all aspects of enterprise security from visibility to response with unmatched speed and efficiency. This is much more than a sidecar system. It can upgrade any security analysts to superhuman levels.We expect this to be a significant source of expansion and growth in the future. At the Black Hat conference earlier this month, thousands of visitors eagerly discovered the capabilities of corporate AI and engage in immersive, interactive, end zone product demos. The best way for companies to prevent cyber-attacks is to leverage the best security and SentinelOne delivers it. Our innovations and holistic approach to cybersecurity puts us in a strong position for long-term growth across multiple large addressable markets, including endpoint, cloud, identity and data. In closing, I extend my gratitude to our incredible team despite a persistently challenging macro environment, sentinels across the world rose to the occasion, addressing critical enterprise needs with the most disruptive technology of the market.I also thank our valued customers, partners and shareholders for their support and trust. We remain focused on the long-term opportunity and maximizing our business potential. With that, I will turn the call over to Dave Bernhardt, our Chief Financial Officer.Dave Bernhardt: Thank you, Tomer. Today, I'll discuss our quarterly financials and provide additional context about our guidance for Q3 and fiscal year '24. As a reminder, all comparisons are year-over-year and all margins discussed are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. We delivered high top line growth and substantial margin expansion. Revenue grew 46% in the second quarter, and our ARR grew 47% to $612 million. We added net new ARR of $49 million in the quarter, achieving strong sequential growth of 17%. Our growth was also balanced across geographies with higher growth in Europe and Asia. Revenue from international markets grew 57%, representing 36% of revenue.We continue to achieve a healthy mix of new customers and existing customer expansion. In addition, our momentum with large enterprises, SMBs and MSSP partners remain strong, which continues to fuel a solid base of long-term growth. As a result, our ARR per customer increased both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting strong momentum with large enterprises and broader platform adoption. We're taking market share from incumbent and next-gen vendors and our second quarter performance signifies our competitive strength in enterprise demand for best-in-class cybersecurity. Before turning to our costs and margins, I'd like to provide an update related to the ARR adjustment we announced in Q1. After conducting a comprehensive review, we implemented robust controls, improved processes and enhanced our ARR reporting structure.In addition, we partnered with a big four accounting firm to objectively validate our processes and controls. Our systems are fully remediated and we're glad this issue is behind us. Looking beyond the top line growth. Our gross margin reached a new record of 77% in Q2, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5 percentage points. Just two years after setting our long-term gross margin target of 75% to 80% of the IPO, we're already operating well within that range. We're seeing continued benefits from economies of scale, data processing efficiencies and cross-sell from adjacent solutions, and our pricing remains healthy. We have taken a highly differentiated approach to unifying our security and data architecture into a single platform, which delivers real value for us and our customers.Our record gross margin demonstrates the success of our land and expand strategy and platform unit economics, where we collect data once and enable more and more capabilities powered by our proprietary fully integrated security data lake. We also delivered substantial operating margin improvement, expanding over 34 percentage points year-over-year to negative 22%. As market conditions evolve, we became even more selective about our investments and took important steps to align our cost structure, including our previously announced workforce optimization. The efforts we have made are paying off. On a dollar basis, we reduced our operating losses by over 40 percentage points in Q2. We also significantly reduced our free cash outflow from $67 million in Q2 of last year to just $15 million this quarter, which reflects an outstanding free cash flow margin improvement of 55 percentage points.This is the result of our proactive efforts to improve working capital and effective cost management. To further demonstrate this, our total cash and equivalents and investments balance reduced by only $2 million in Q2 and only $5 million year-to-date in fiscal '24. In short, our losses and cash burn have rapidly narrowed, and we are steadily marching towards positive free cash flow and profitability. Moving to our guidance for Q3 and the full fiscal year '24. We expect global economic conditions in a broader demand environment to remain consistent with the trends we discussed last quarter as enterprises continue to rightsize their security investments based on near-term budget constraints. Even with this as the market backdrop, we're raising our revenue and margin expectations for fiscal year '24.Our teams are executing well. Our win rates remain strong, and we are delivering operating leverage. In Q3, we expect revenue of about $156 million, reflecting growth of 35% year-over-year. Based on this view, we expect Q3 net new ARR to be comparable to Q2 levels, which is consistent with the typical seasonality and still comes on top of our Q2 outperformance. For the full-year, we expect revenue of about $605 million, reflecting growth of 43% in fiscal year '24, a $10 million increase compared to the prior midpoint of $595 million. Based on this view, we expect full-year ARR to grow in the high 30% range, adding about $195 million in net new ARR in fiscal year '24. This is a higher ARR growth rate compared to our prior expectation of mid-30%.Based on our go-to-market and pipeline momentum, we feel confident in our ability to deliver against our Q3 and our stronger full year growth targets. Importantly, we're seeing durability in new business generation and the trajectory of growth rates. We're encouraged by increasing platform adoption and competitive position, offering diverse and meaningful growth opportunities for years to come. Turning to the outlook for margins. We expect Q3 gross margin of about 76%, implying a year-over-year increase of more than 4 percentage points. On a constant currency basis, our Q3 gross margin expectation is consistent with Q2. Also for the full year, we are raising our gross margin guidance to 76%, up about 4 percentage points year-over-year and up 150 basis points when compared to our prior guided midpoint of 74.5%.We've taken a major step forward as a company by achieving our long-term gross margin target range and expect continued benefits from increasing scale and data efficiencies inherent in our business model to drive higher gross margins over time. Finally, for operating margin, we expect negative 22% in Q3, implying an improvement of more than 20 percentage points year-over-year. For the full-year, we are raising our guidance for operating margin to about negative 25%, up 2 percentage points compared to the prior midpoint and at the better end of our previous annual guidance. This implies a notable improvement of more than 24 percentage points compared to fiscal year '23. We've made significant investments in innovation and talent development over the past few years.This gives us ample runway to deliver against our product road map and growth targets. We also expect continued benefits from cost management initiatives and operating leverage of our business. We have a very strong balance sheet with more than $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and no debt. This provides durability, flexibility and an independent path to generating positive cash flows. Our goal is to optimize top line growth with consistent margin improvement. On our journey to achieving profitability, we don't intend to sacrifice growth or market share. Our investment approach will remain highly selective and focused on key areas of competitive strength. We're delivering industry-leading margin improvement and steadily approaching positive free cash flow generation.We remain steadfast on our path to achieving profitability in fiscal year '25. Thank you all for joining today. We will now take questions. Operator, please open up the line.See also 10 Stocks That Are About To Explode and 12 Best High Risk High Reward Stocks To Buy Now.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: We will now begin the Q&amp;A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ray McDonough with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.Ray McDonough: Great, thanks for taking the question. Tomer, congratulations on a good quarter here and what seems to be an improvement. But I think the question on a lot of investors' minds here is the reports that SentinelOne is seeking or at least evaluating strategic alternatives. Can you comment on that process? And then separately, can you comment on the partnership or the termination of the partnership with Wiz. When that was first announced, I think there was some excitement, not only from investors, but also from your field partners and the channel. So just curious how you're thinking about those two things and how you're thinking about your own road map in cloud security now that you've terminated that partnership.A - Tomer Weingarten We don't comment on rumors or speculation, but let me be clear. I mean our focus is on building an independent company for the long-term. we're delivering substantial growth and margin improvement. And most importantly, we have the best technology and a clear strategic road map to disrupt a $100 billion market with the potential to multiply our current market share in the coming years. I think also our teams are executing well. Competitive positioning remains incredibly strong. We delivered excellent results. All in all, I think you're just seeing us being laser-focused on delivering the best innovation we can, the best protection we can for our customers, maximizing our business potential. We believe we can do that the best as possible as a public independent transparent company.And I think that is as clear as I can be. On the Wiz thing, if you kind of bundle it on the acquisition rumors and all that stuff, I mean, again, I'm not going to comment on that, but it's all pure speculation on their part and far from fact. So it's, again, a head scratcher to me. If we kind of pivot to the partnership, we did not terminate the partnership. I think that's again misconstrued. We actually canceled a reseller agreement, a reselling agreement. So we still partner with Wiz, we still work with them on the field level. We still think there's some form of complementary technology there, and we're focused on delivering customer outcomes. So when customers want to use Wiz, will support that. The technical integration is still there.Wiz is a nice little startup, we like working with them. But again, in terms of the reselling agreement, we didn't see any contribution from that. We didn't feel like that's something that is fulfilled on their end, so we decided to terminate that. Our cloud-native application platform is growing, I think, in a stellar pace. We're definitely ahead of our targets. We just announced cloud data security. That's a major expansion to our workload protection platform that's part of that overall seen up envelope. And we want ourselves to be focused on our own capabilities. And I think that's natural. We're also seeing tremendous traction in that market. Obviously, triple-digit growth for our cloud business year-over-year for a few good quarters now and a couple of years now is obviously giving us a lot of confidence that we can continue and grow that, and we'll continue to develop our own native capabilities alongside that.Operator: Our next question is from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.Rob Owens: Great, thanks for taking my question. I want to drill down a little bit into retention rates. And I know there was commentary in the shareholder letter, excuse me, around the Attivo legacy products. So if you could just kind of clarify what exactly those are? And do we still expect the 120 level to be a floor as we move forward? Or could you see additional pressure? Thanks.Tomer Weingarten: Yes. I think what you're seeing with the net retention rate is something that's industry-wide. I don't think it's unique to us. I think we do -- we do see our own, call it, natural retention rates still being incredibly high, even in light of macro factors of generally closing customers to be much more prudent about their spend and their timing also of expansion. Attivo legacy product, as you can imagine, with any acquisition, there's some degree of customer churn and that happens typically for the kind of older product lines, Identity security, obviously, is the shining spot. I mean we continuously grow that. It's a big contributor to all revenue outside of endpoint. But things like deception, which is very, very interesting industry-specific.I think that sometimes we don't put all the focus on. We continue to support the specific customers that use these legacy products, but we're much more focused on identity security, active directory assessment, all these more forward-looking products that came with that acquisition and obviously are today integrated into our platform.Operator: Our next question is from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.Brian Essex: Hi, great. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question and congrats on a much better results this quarter. Tomer, I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit -- digging a little bit more on the competitive environment. I think you previously talked about or at least have commented on win rates relative to both Microsoft and CrowdStrike. Any changes in the competitive environment? And then kind of adjacent to that question, how do you think about growth of sales and marketing expense as you have this kind of tremendous market opportunity ahead of you and you're obviously balancing investment in sales and marketing, market penetration, but also you're delivering some pretty impressive margin expansion in the process. Those two segments would be really helpful to better understand.Tomer Weingarten: Our competitive position, I think, is improving. I mean we're seeing now meaningful differentiation on the technology front. Everybody likes to make all sorts of statements about how unified your platform is or isn't. We're the only platform out there that actually delivers on that promise. I think that to us, that becomes more and more meaningful as customers are looking to gain enterprise-wide visibility and they want to do it. They want to do it with 1 console. They want to do it with one language. They want to do it with one interface. That is not what our competitors are selling into the market. I think if you want to talk about competitors, let's also talk about the blatant misrepresentations they had on their earnings call made so clearly.I think it's unbelievable that you see them calling out or implying that, you know we are a coin for a company when it's plain to see that we're the broadest platform out there. When they call themselves a unified platform, but actually have two distinctively different platforms, two consoles, two languages, two product lines, that's an overt missed representation and that confuses customers, I think it's just shocking to see that. When they say that the only generative AI company to demo generative AI at conference shows, that's also a blatant lie. I mean, obviously, we've been the first to demo that. There are other vendors that have demoed that. Everybody is giving live demos. We actually gave hands-on live demos. So if we talk about the competition, I think it's important to separate fact from all these rumors and speculations and misrepresentations and our competitive positioning, our technology is true.I think that's what customers are getting into their hands, that the reason we win, that's the reason that we continue to grow market share.Brian Essex: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.Operator: Our next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is now open.Alex Henderson: Great, thank you so much. Nice rebound in the quarter. Clearly, if you listen, and I'm sure you did, to the CrowdStrike presentation. They delineated the scale and some of the growth rates around some of their products. And I was hoping maybe you could take a page out of their book and give us some of the -- some granularity around some of these key products that you call out, whether it be the cloud product, Vigilance, Ranger, pick your category? Thanks.Tomer Weingarten: I think at our scale, I mean, we're not at a point that we're ready to disclose that. I think we're giving you good indications as to what part of our portfolio is going. We're giving you an indication that more than 30% of our revenue contribution is coming from outside of endpoint. We're giving an indication we gave last quarter that cloud is growing incredibly fast, triple-digit year-over-year represents well over 20% of quarterly ACVs on average, if you kind of look at the rearview mirror in the last 12 months. So all in all, I think that can give you some sense. I also think that for us, data analytics and security data lake, the Singularity data lake, these capabilities are just coming online. And they're coming online pretty fast.So hopefully, as we gain a little bit more scale, I think we'll be able to disclose much more on how we look at our business. But right now, obviously, we're just focused on growing as fast as we can between these core TAMs that we identified are strategic to our growth.Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.Andrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you and congrats on the nice quarter, nice rebound. So I wanted to ask about net new ARR, maybe particularly the guidance for Q3. I understand the year-over-year decline in Q2, given the tough comp you had from last year. But if you think about all the positive trends you guys described here today, why wouldn't you expect maybe more growth out of net new ARR in Q3 given that the macro really hasn't changed. It hasn't gotten worse or better, I guess what I mean.David Bernhardt: Sure. We just exceeded our Q2 net new ARR expectation by double digits. We raised our Q3 net new ARR outlook, and we raised the full ARR growth to the high 30s. So I think the way to think about it is we're just being thoughtful about macro stabilization, which is still evolving. And I think we just believe that being prudent is the right approach in our view.Operator: Our next question is from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Tomer, I wanted to ask a question on some of the feedback you're getting from customers that are trying the new Purple product. What are the one or two asks that are coming out of those trials in terms of the next one or two features that customers want in the product? And how are you thinking about the pricing model over the medium term? Thank you.Tomer Weingarten: Yes. The first question is always what's the pricing. I think that's consistently what we're getting from them. And we're starting to share and I you know, most actually would say we're testing pricing with these customers. So I don't have kind of a flushed out pricing model to give you just yet. But it's definitely something that we're kind of processing right now. I think in terms of their request, and that is key is that we continue and push purple to be an overarching enterprise-wide algorithm versus being focused just on endpoint data or just on cloud data and that once again comes back to the level of differentiation that you see with our platform today. When you think about some of these AI capabilities, when you think about the scale you can achieve with AI, you obviously want to start stitching together all these disparate products, all these siloed ecosystem vendors into one cohesive fabric that can also allow you to, in some cases, consolidate the waste of these products.But in some other cases, these products are still going to be there, but you want to make sure that something more intelligent is driving them and that you can orchestrate action. So people want us to do it on an enterprise scale, people want us to do it in a highly autonomous manner and in a highly actionable manner. They don't want more suggestions. They don't want more chatbots, they want predictive algorithms that can allow them in real time to react to what they're seeing enterprise-wide. And I think that's exactly how we're developing purple. That's exactly the first iteration of this product. And all in all, it looks just very promising.Operator: Our next question is from Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Good to see the bounce back. Dave, a question for you. Can you discuss gross margins the improvement actually vis-a-vis what do you see in terms of ASP pressures?David Bernhardt: Yes. Obviously, there's not ASP pressures or we wouldn't be setting record gross margins. So I guess I'll start with that. We had record gross margin this quarter of 77%. I think that's a benefit of our increasing scale, the data processing efficiencies and the module cross-sell, which we also expect will continue over time. So I think we're proud of the gain we've had in gross margin and just don't seem to be seeing the ASP issues that other competitors may be seeing.Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.Patrick Colville: Alright. Thank you so much for taking my question. So I mean this quarter, the operating margin improvement was really impressive. In my model. So you beat this quarter, you listed fiscal '20 margin by 2 points, but that means in my model, if I'm counting it correctly, but my actual 4Q number comes down to operating margin. So like why would that be? It's probably one question. And then how should we think about your kind of like long-term guidance for fiscal and your goal to reach operating margin profitability next year?David Bernhardt: So we raised our full-year EBIT margin, like you said, by 2 points at the midpoint. It's the better end of our annual guidance. Now we've focused on that instead of 25% to 29% loss, we're focused on the 25%. We believe that's meaningful. We're on track for 25 points or about 25 points of operating margin improvement this year. I think one of the things we're seeing coming off a strong Q2 is also should we be investing into some things where we're seeing benefits. So our second-half is expecting some of that. We're able to do all of that and improve the guidance for the year to the better end of anything we were expecting for the year at the start. So we're proud of this guidance. We're always going to balance our investments in growth with our commitment to achieving profitability. And our goal remains unchanged for next year, but we'll be guiding that in the future.Operator: Our next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open.Adam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Hope to get a two-parter in, Dave. First, a clarification. On NRR with the Attivo piece, is there any way that you could potentially help us quantify so that we could strip that piece out. I'm just curious what the underlying trends would have looked like for the health of the business ex that? And then Tomer, as a follow-up, I know we kind of touched on the Wiz subject. But curious, cloud security is obviously one of your fastest-growing areas, it sounds like you're still committed to that partnership. But honestly, why. That piece of the business is growing so rapidly. You've got a broad platform. Where do they fit in? What do you -- honestly, what do you need them for. Thanks.David Bernhardt: I'll start. Our NRR on an organic basis would have been 120%. So it's still at the expectations that we've set forth in prior earnings calls. So the 5% decrement was purely Attivo. I'll let Tomer answer the other question.Tomer Weingarten: Yes. One way I thought -- I kind of said it, it's really what the customer wants. And obviously, they got a nice set of customers kind of in the Fortune 100. We want to make sure that we support them. Some of them are our customers, too. We want to make sure we deliver the best experience. So when a customer wants to use Wiz by all means, and we will be there to support it. When a customer wants something more realistic, obviously, we will serve our own. I think there's also a big difference between what they can serve, which is highly limited to public cloud, where if you look at our platform and our workload protection, we cater to folks from on-prem environments and server and workload environments that might be on-premise all the way to private cloud and then to public cloud.So it's also a slightly different use case. But I think what you can kind of gather about SentinelOne is that we're very partner-friendly, no matter who the partner is. We are guided by what customers want to do and we will always stand by that, and we will always support customers. So in that, we -- Wiz is another great partner of ours from many other partners that we have. So there's no reason for us not to partner with them.Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Patrick on for Josh. So you mentioned last quarter after the adjustments to ARR that the revenue to ARR correlation should be tighter moving forward. But if you look at that historical delta, it actually ticked up a bit here in 2Q from 1Q and is a little closer to what we saw last year. So curious, did you see some shrink to come back in that consumption part of the business? And then has anything changed from last quarter with how you factor that consumption part into the guidance? Thanks.David Bernhardt: I'd say we're still very closely aligned. I think revenue increase year-over-year was 47%, and the ARR was 46%. And I'd say that's pretty close. So we expect that to continue to be aligned for the rest of the year.Unidentified Analyst: I guess, I meant.Operator: Our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.Saket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey guys thanks for having me on the call. Tomer, I kind of have a two-part question for you, if I may. The first one is on the competitive environment. I know we talked about the other endpoint player out there. But I want to ask specifically on Microsoft. One of the things that came out on another conference call was maybe you're starting to see customers question the real price, the real underlying price of Microsoft Defender, do you agree with that? Are you hearing that from customers? That's the first part. The second part of the question is more of an industry question on CNAP. There are endpoint players that have CNAP, there are firewall players that have CNAP and then there are individual vendors that have CNAP.What are you hearing from customers on their preference to buy from one category versus another. Is there a natural, I don't know, tendency to buy from an endpoint or for a firewall vendor? Or is that still something that's being determined?Tomer Weingarten: So on Microsoft, we definitely see more customers starting to understand that the lack of price transparency is causing them to actually overpay for what they would actually get from another vendor at a lower price point. I mean if you bundle together the workload pricing, the login pricing, the service pricing, all of that together comes up to a pretty hefty price tag if you're going with Microsoft. And I think we can all agree not to best-of-breed security. So we're definitely seeing more of that. I think there is a slight dynamic change there. I wouldn't call any of that right now, transformative or pieces changing, I think, it's just starting to trickle. I think if you couple that with the fact that not only Microsoft is not the cheapest solution, Microsoft also doesn't really care as much about customers just under sheer scale, right?I mean we're talking about a complete different level of support if you're going with a stand-alone cybersecurity provider like our -- like us and some of our peers, I think you're just getting a completely different level of service, and that is something that is also starting to resonate with customers out there. And lastly, I think it's just the complexity. Microsoft has a lot of different ingredients in what they call security. It's not one platform. It's a bundle of solutions, and I think that also matters significantly. If we want to touch on CNAP, I think your observation is 100% correct. And I think that a lot of folks gravitated towards the stand-alone CNAP vendors on the back of just great UI. I think there's no deep IP in CNAP, inventory, attack graph visualization, like all these things, that's not AI.That's not deep IP. And I think that's where you're seeing this commoditization where everybody is coming up with their own capabilities to achieve that. And I think it really is what flavor that the customer wants to go with. And once again, we're flexible. I mean if you want to get that out of us, we will definitely build the best platform that we can. But if you rather have a different flavor, that's fine, too. We're focusing where there's deep technology and workload protection, run time protection. This is where you can actually and meaningfully differentiate. This is non-commoditized. This is where our years of research, supporting Linux environment, containerized environments, bringing best-of-breed telemetry, best to be performance, that's where it matters.And that's where we win the most. And that's why that remains our focus as we build these other capabilities to get to this holistic approach to cloud security. But once again, you get different flavors of customers. You're going to get fewer public cloud customers, you're going to get private cloud customers, you're going to get on-prem workload customers. It's not one size fits all in some of these stand-alone offerings, they're not really relevant in any other setting other than a public cloud setting.Operator: Our next question is from Trevor Walsh with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.Trevor Walsh: Great, thanks for taking my question. Tomer, on the subject of the Ranger insights that you announced earlier in the month, can you just walk us through maybe what the kind of, I guess, 1.0 or first type of -- how that opportunity looks initially vis-a-vis kind of other players in that vulnerability management space and then kind of where you're looking to maybe go with that product and kind of what the opportunity looks like kind of in six, 12 months? Thanks.Tomer Weingarten: Yes. I mean great traction already. I think it's something that we kind of vetted and built with customers, and it's focused on identifying vulnerabilities, prioritizing vulnerabilities and allowing you to gain full context on vulnerabilities together with endpoint data in one same place. And given that most vulnerabilities actually lie on endpoints and servers, it really is a very, very natural place for it to live together. And now we're working on adding more and more remediation capabilities that can inform you, once you get informed on a vulnerability, you can automatically remediate it. So I think for a lot of these vendors right now in that space using all kinds of scanning tools and you need to deploy another agent.And sometimes you need an incumbent vendor that adds just another overhead on the machine with us. I mean, if you're an existing customer, you're just getting it. It's already there. And I think the most important part of it is that it's also done in a complete continuous manner. So this is not a onetime skin type of a thing. It's a continuous profile of your environment. And we can highlight all these vulnerabilities the moment that they pop up, and we can offer up remediation the moment that something pops up. So to me, it's a very natural expansion. It's a great little TAM that we can now also serve between $5 billion to $7 billion. And it's just, again, something that we believe will streamline operations significantly for a lot of customers out there.The one last thing I want to say about this is that it's also highly strategic for our MSSP segment, the MSSP partners are always looking for ways to, you know, get to better hygiene to patch customer machines and by allowing them to the same remote management platform that they're using today our SentinelOne Singularity platform to now also cover vulnerabilities, we're lying for extreme cost efficiency for them and obviously an avenue for expansion. So strategic on both fronts, and we're very, very proud of launching vulnerability management into our endpoint management suite.Operator: Our next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open.Jonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to understand a little bit better. If you could give us some more detail around the significant improvement around your sales execution and performance. I guess my question is what's made the most difference? And where are we in terms of those improvements? Is there sort of further opportunities ahead as well? Thank you.Tomer Weingarten: We're always working to improve. To us, this never ends. I think just better scrutiny, better training, better enablement, better pipeline sourcing, better interaction with our channel, all of that, I think, funnel to just better execution, some technical elements like contract execution, all of that has been streamlined, better systems in place. I mean we've done a lot in the course of 90-days to elevate our performance and still a lot remains to be done. I think we're only going to get better from here. The important part is that we got a great seller DNA in our sales force. We have worked to diversify our sales force. We're now selling into four different distinct TAMs. We wanted sellers with cloud DNA. We wanted sellers with data DNA.We're now building those disciplines, and that obviously allows us to treat all these adjacent growth opportunities in such a tailored manner and that creates, I think, just better execution, better win rates, better conversion rates on our pipeline. So all in all, again, continued work, but I think we're doing all the right things.Operator: Our next question is from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. It's Daniel on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. So you called out another standout quarter with your MSSP partners. Just wanted to see if you could provide some color on sort of what's resonating in this part of your business, especially as it pertains to some of your newer emerging modules you guys highlighted.Tomer Weingarten: Absolutely. I think, first and foremost, it's still the core elements of our overall platform. The ability to manage multiple, sometimes thousands of customers in one single click console is still a very unique capability in this space. So as our MSSP partners, kind of, look to grow, look to add more customers, they can do it with ease, they can do it with confidence. And obviously, they're well trained on our platform to-date. So the elements of automation and manageability are first and foremost, I think why we have that strong footprint in the MSSP realm. The other elements of what we do, like MDR, which they're adopting now and reselling to their customer base, is also a nice expansion opportunity for us, where a lot of our MSSP partners want even more tailored security for their customers and they're leveraging our own MDR services as a resell to their partner base.Cloud security is coming online for some of these partners, again, covering server environments. We've actually tapped through a lot of server environments and they tap those so far with endpoint licenses. We're now converting those into server licenses. If you kind of think about the Ranger and Ranger Insights module, they've already been onboarded on Ranger, which allows them for asset discovery. We're seeing traction with that. Ranger insight will catapult that even further. Again, vulnerability management is a very natural expansion to what they do. So all in all, with the MSSP environment, I would say the opportunity is twofold. It's the modules. There's no question that we're still underpenetrated. But at the same time, we're also underpenetrated on licenses, seat counts and a number of end points.A lot of our MSSP partners still have a huge potential in their estate, and we're working with them every day to expand our footprint and to make sure that they are as competitive as they can be.Operator: Our last question is from Eric Heath with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.Eric Heath: Great, thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in. I did enjoy seeing the purple AI demo RSA back in April, it was impressive. So I wanted to ask you what your thoughts are on timing for that to become available? And then coming back to the CNAP question. Just Curious if there's any change in the way you're thinking about either adding or not adding CSPM or application security capabilities to that platform?Tomer Weingarten: Yes. We're not sharing right now the exact launch date. It will be next year. We're definitely dating this with customers. So stay tuned. We will share more as time progresses. But on the CNAP stuff, we haven't really changed the way we think about it. We always wanted to have and always we're always working on broad-based CNAP capabilities that include CSPM as well. And that hasn't changed. I think the only thing that changed is that we're actually a bit more advanced in our road map than we initially expected, and that's a good sign. Once again, we launched data security, which is another part of that CNAP spectrum. And it's a very unique capability. It's an AI-driven approach to detect threats on storage like S3 and even on-prem storage like NetApp.There's nobody else in the market doing that. So all in all, I mean, we're always focusing first on the more differentiated parts of the platform versus going to the commodity. But at some point, I think we'll have the full spectrum of capabilities. And right now, again, given our traction, we're not in a rush to do any of that. It's not like there's any mandatory requirement to have all of these components baked in together as evidenced by our success in the market.Operator: We are out of time, and I will now pass the call back to the management team for any closing remarks.Tomer Weingarten: Thank you, everybody. I appreciate your time today, and I want to again congratulate all Sentinels for their performance this quarter.Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

53,3d297fdb-faa0-38c5-b68a-446215c9683c,MSFT,2023-09-02,Investors Heavily Search Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-microsoft-corporation-130010304.html,1693573210,STORY,['MSFT'],"[Microsoft (MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this software maker have returned +0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has lost 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.65 per share, indicating a change of +12.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.1%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.42 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $54.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $233.78 billion and $263.46 billion estimates indicate +10.3% and +12.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicrosoft reported revenues of $56.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.3%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $2.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $55.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.5%. The EPS surprise was +5.91%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reported EPS is $1.55, expectations were $1.34.Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Signet Jewelers Q2 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, August 31, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Ballew, SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Rob Ballew: Good morning. Welcome to Signet Jewelers second quarter earnings call. On the call today are Signet's CEO, Gina Drosos, and Chief Financial, Strategy and Services Officer, Joan Hilson. During today's presentation, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For further discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures as well as a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to those GAAP measures, investors should review the news release we posted on our website at www.signetjewelers.com/investors. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gina.Gina Drosos: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before getting into our prepared remarks, I want to thank our Signet team for their dedication, resilience and disciplined execution this quarter. In a challenging environment, we over-delivered on our commitments. Signet’s recognition as a great place to work is driven entirely by our team members' capability and commitment and the winning and inclusive culture we continue to build together. There are three key messages I'd like to emphasize today. First, we are on track to deliver the year. In the second quarter, we exceeded our revenue and bottom-line commitments, and we remain confident in our full year guidance. We delivered these results in a challenging macro environment, which impacts our mid-market customers disproportionately, and as we predicted, with significantly fewer engagements in the quarter resulting from COVID’s disruption of dating three years ago.Story continuesOur performance against these headwinds reflects both the agility of our team and our flexible operating model. Second, trends are modestly improving. We've seen generally modest improvement in customer traffic and purchase behavior since early June, with lower price points rebounding, particularly in fashion. Average transaction value or ATV appears to have stabilized and is trending roughly in line with last year. Further, our data capabilities now allow us to track 45 signals of couples progressing toward engagement, and these are falling in line as we anticipated, pointing to a multiyear recovery beginning in our fourth quarter. These are all positive signs as we finalize our preparations for the holiday season. Third, we are widening our moat of competitive advantages, especially in our personalized marketing, digital experience, data analytics and services.We are generating meaningful cost savings, on track to land between $225 million to $250 million this year and reinvesting to drive market share growth over time. We remain confident that we can deliver the midterm goals we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year. Let's take a closer look at each of these three messages, beginning with our performance in the second quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in Q2, delivering approximately $1.6 billion in sales and $103 million in non-GAAP operating income. We achieved this quarter's results despite the meaningful drags of both the challenging macro environment and the predicted decline in engagements. We believe we continue to grow bridal share during this trough and we are confident that engagements are on track to begin their multiyear recovery later this year.Non-GAAP operating income reflects core merchandise margin expansion of more than 180 basis points compared to last year, driven by an increase in services mix, our scaled sourcing efforts and higher lab-created diamond mix, which remains a mid-teen percentage of our diamond business mix. Because of Signet's strategic efforts in branding, style offerings and specialty cuts, the items we are selling with LCDs carry both a higher margin and higher ATV than natural diamonds. Importantly, compared to this time pre-pandemic, non-GAAP operating margin is up 250 basis points on 18% higher sales despite 16% fewer stores, showcasing that our transformation and flexible operating model is working as intended. The second point I want to emphasize is the modest improvement we're seeing in the overall health of our customer.Fashion merchandise sales increased sequentially in the second quarter, up 4 points year-over-year compared to the first quarter results. This was led by stronger performances at Kay and Banter which saw improved same-store sales for much of the second half of the quarter. While overall fashion sales improved modestly, we saw a robust improvement through the quarter for fashion merchandise below $1,000. For example, Kay drove great performance in our refreshed basics assortment, comprised of timeless core product like [soups] (ph) and diamonds and gold as well as classic styles in neck and bracelet pieces. We've seen the same trend at accessible price points in Banter, pieces that provide customers with versatility and that they can wear every day.Kay, Zales and Jared also saw comparable sales growth at the highest price points in our fashion assortment as our core banners remained strong in romantic gifting. Our data on independent jewelers shows declines in this segment, reflecting our share gains in the quarter. As we finalize our preparations for the upcoming holiday season, merchandising assortment plays a critical role in our strategy. For example, at Kay, we're leaning into innovation in yellow gold, which continues to trend well and is also multiculturally appealing. Kay is also focusing on gift box assortments under $500 as well as strong bridal innovation, including larger center stone pieces and new collections in Neil Lane and Monique Lhuillier. At Zales, we'll bring new styles into our premier bridal collection Vera Wang Love, while also introducing new fine jewelry essentials, including hoop earrings in multiple metal options and sizes as well as diamond fashion at accessible price points for everyday wear and gifting.At Jared, we have lifted the penetration of yellow gold to 30% across bridal innovated around the collection of gender-inclusive bands and engagement rings and developed a beautiful new elevated entry price personalized charm collection with New York City influencer design Lisa Salzer with a collection from Lulu Frost. We believe this innovation is on trend culturally and at the right price points. Similar to last year, we anticipate that customers will wait a bit later into the holiday season to begin their shopping. Economic pressure on discretionary dollars often leads customers to delay their shopping to Black Friday and the days leading into Christmas. We've built our marketing, labor planning and merchandising strategy for the back half to attract these customers with this in mind.In marketing, this means leveraging our customer data to drive smarter, more personalized messaging on the platforms that our customers are using most, making more effective and efficient use of our spend. Within our labor planning, we're using store-by-store hour-by-hour level data to match labor hours to customer demand. The key message here is that our data and scaled innovation positions us with meaningful advantages for the holidays. The third and most important point I want to make is our continued confidence that we can deliver our midterm goals over the next three to five years as we continue to invest to widen our competitive advantages. Two of the most common questions we received from investors are, first, how we've bridged our current year performance from pre-pandemic, and second, how we're bridging the current year to our midterm goals.We've posted a new investor deck this morning, which I believe addresses these two questions, and I'll devote the balance of my remarks to why we are confident in our midterm goals. We're focused on four growth drivers. Winning the engagement recovery, expanding accessible luxury, growing services and developing unassailable competitive advantages in digital and data-driven marketing. Taken together, we believe these four drivers will lead to a $9 billion to $10 billion in revenue, 11% to 12% annual non-GAAP EBIT margin and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $14 to $16 per share over the next three to five years. Importantly, both the current year and our midterm goals assume no pandemic spending lift, with a 1% to 2% compound annual growth rate for the jewelry category from calendar 2019 to calendar 2028.The first big opportunity is bridal. By design, bridal is a big business for us, and as engagements begin their recovery later this year, we're positioning ourselves to capture a multiyear tailwind. This is important because bridal is a highly strategic category. It's frequently the most important emotional and financial point of market entry into the jewelry category. That means that in addition to initial sales, it drives the beginning of lifetime relationships leading to future purchases for special events, anniversaries and holidays throughout our customers' lives. We see bridal as a $600 million revenue growth opportunity. Prior to the pandemic, we estimate the number of engagements was consistently close to 2.8 million per year. That began dropping last year, and we estimate it will bottom out this calendar year 2023 between 2.1 million and 2.2 million, or nearly 25% fewer engagements than normal.Based on our data, we believe engagements will begin recovering in Q4 and fully rebound over the next three years. Just holding our estimated 30% share of the bridal market and engagement ATV constant, the 650,000 increase in total engagements is worth more than $500 million in revenue from engagement rings alone. But we are positioning ourselves to grow bridal market share as we are doing in 2023 and create competitive advantage in the bridal ecosystem of jewelry gifting as well as extending our reach into customers' lifetime value. The remaining $100 million or more of opportunity reflects our investments in personalization, customization and the loyalty to accomplish this. So why are we confident that engagements will recover? Our confidence is based on 45 proprietary milestones we track to measure a couple's journey toward engagement.While every couple is unique, dating and relationships tend to follow patterns. Not every couple experiences all of the 45 milestones we track, but we know that once they reach 25 to 30 of these milestones, they become statistically significantly more likely to move on to engagement. This quarter, we saw the pool of couples approaching the 25 to 30 milestones increase by 700 basis points. Additionally, we are seeing states like Texas and Florida, which we opened earlier in the pandemic, 10 points closer to pre-pandemic engagement levels compared to California and New York, which reopened later in the pandemic. One final data point here. When we look at early relationship triggers, we're also seeing improvement to last year. For example, one of the early relationship triggers we've mentioned before is going to a sporting event or a concert together, an indicator that is up 7% to early 2022.This is equally important because this recovery will be multiyear and gradual. Signet is well positioned to win in this environment. We’ve identified a proprietary audience of more than 14 million people who are in dating relationships and are targeting them with education and marketing that's right for them as their journey progresses. Our next growth driver is accessible luxury, which we believe represents $1 billion in revenue growth potential driven by tiering up the Jared brand, expanding the Diamonds Direct fleet and growing our digital banners, James Allen and Blue Nile. We believe Jared represents a $500 million growth opportunity as we expand the assortment of more premium offerings. Compared to Q2 of fiscal year '20, this strategy has already led to growth of ATV of more than 60% at Jared.Importantly, this reflects only a low single-digit impact from taking price as Jared's ATV improvement has been driven almost completely by assortment optimization and premium items. Our test pilot for preferred assortment continues to drive significantly higher comparable revenue than the remainder of the fleet. And based on early results, that alone would be worth more than $100 million in revenue applied to all Jared stores. We will be expanding the preferred assortment to 50 additional stores in the third quarter ahead of the upcoming holiday season with further expansion planned in coming quarters. We expect to grow Diamonds Direct revenue by $350 million over the medium term as we open more than 20 new locations across the country, each of which we expect will build to over $15 million of average annual revenue.Notably, Diamonds Direct revenue is highly skewed to bridal with an ATV that is more than four times the average of our other banners. Rounding out growth in accessible luxury are our digital banners, often the tip of the spear for digital enhancements and innovations, our midterm goals reflect a path to more than $1 billion in revenue between Blue Nile and James Allen. We are pleased that the digital re-platform was completed on time at the end of July, and we are now fully focused on delivering the growth and synergies made possible by this acquisition. Our third growth driver is services, which we see growing by $500 million to $1.2 billion in revenue. Services, which have a roughly 20-point margin premium over merchandise, will see about half of that growth from extended service agreements, or ESAs, as we focus on customer visibility and employee training to enhance our customer shopping experience by providing a path to worry-free wear, building trust and growing our lifetime customer base.We drove a 370 basis point increase to ESA attachment rate on in-store bridal purchases this quarter compared to prior year. Product education for our jewelry consultants or JCs, as well as pricing transparency for our customers has been key. We continue to introduce product enhancements like post-purchase attachment. This feature allows customers to purchase the ESA up to 30 days after the jewelry purchase, allowing our JCs to follow up, for example, with the purchaser after the gifting occasion. The progress we've made in ESA is one of the reasons Services outperformed merchandise again this quarter as we delivered more than 4% growth in Services revenue. Customization, repair and piercing will drive the rest of the growth in Services. Last month, we acquired SJR National Repair, primarily a full-service jewelry and watch repair services business.diamondImage Credit: Pixabay/Public DomainThis acquisition complements the recent transition of Signet's Blue Nile Seattle fulfillment center to a new enterprise-wide repair facility. Signet's national service network now enables business-to-business repair services, watch repair and mailing capabilities among other offerings. We are also increasing the number of locations that provide piercings as well as soldering for permanent jewelry, which is a growing trend, particularly among Gen Z and social media platform users. The final growth driver is our increasingly digital and data-driven approach to marketing, which enables highly personalized communication and experiences. We see a [$450] (ph) million opportunity here. We're continuing to grow our newly implemented customer data platform or CDP.This platform is helping us drive both more effective marketing and customized digital shopping experiences. We increased our return on advertising spend by more than 20% this quarter when compared to this time last year by enhancing our targeting and optimizing our channel mix. Further, when a known customer visits our website, we personalize their experience with content based on the customers' known interests, intent and prior shopping behavior. This more personalized shopping experience often targets relevant life, for example, dating, anniversaries, graduations or potential engagements. We recently launched personalized product recommendations for our customers as our first activation and have plans for many others. This level of personalization at scale is a clear competitive advantage.Rounding out my comments on personalization and customer data, I'd quickly point out that we continue to make great progress in participation and impact with our loyalty program. This quarter, we increased our total enrollment by more than 30%. The ATV of our loyalty members this quarter was 40% higher than non-loyalty members. We continue to test loyalty offerings that elevate the shopping experience in ways unique to jewelry and special occasions. What I hope you can see is that we have concrete achievable building blocks that get us to our midterm goals, and these strategic initiatives are in flight and showing the results we expect. Signet's business fundamentals are strong and the structural changes we've made over the past few years are working as we intended.As a result, we believe our confidence in our midterm goals is well placed. I'll now pass it over to Joan.Joan Hilson: Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter reflects the strength and importance of our flexible operating model as we delivered on our commitments amidst a challenging retail landscape. We drove over $1.6 billion in sales this quarter, down 8.1% to this time last year, with same-store sales down 12%. We have seen top-line improvements since the May time frame with second quarter comp sales better than the first quarter, driven by a stronger June and July. Bridal performed as we expected, and we saw an increase in conversion in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. We saw sequential improvement in price points below $1,000, particularly within the fashion assortment. Our average transaction value in North America grew more than 4%, with 5 points attributable from Blue Nile.Comparable ATV was relatively flat, consistent with the last quarter. Compared to pre-pandemic, our core banners have grown low single digits driven by off-mall and e-commerce growth. Services represents nearly half of the growth in our core banners over the last four years with fashion driving the balance, consistent with our strategic priorities. Consumer access to credit in the quarter was healthy and approval rates remain near historical norms with overall payment plant penetration at 44%, and the amount financed are both relatively consistent to last year. While we're not directly impacted by rising or declining delinquency rates, those rates among our finance partners have been stable in recent months. Within our agreements, we have guaranteed commitment levels.Turning now to gross margin. We delivered $611 million of gross margin or 38% of sales, roughly in line with last year. Overall merchandise margin expanded 80 basis points, largely due to higher services margin as well as a higher penetration of services. Additionally, while organized retail crime loss is up across retailers generally, our mitigation efforts have resulted in a decrease and store losses compared to the same time last year, boosting gross margins by 15 basis points. Offsetting those gains is deleveraging of fixed costs such as occupancy on lower sales. Now turning to SG&amp;A. Our non-GAAP spend of $507 million or 31% of revenue was 420 basis points higher than last year. Our total SG&amp;A dollars increased due to the Blue Nile acquisition.As we said, we continue to make strategic investments to enhance our moat of competitive advantages which was approximately 120 basis points of the deleverage in SG&amp;A during the quarter. The remaining balance is due to advertising shift into Q2 from Mother's Day timing and deleveraging of fixed cost on lower volume. As a result, we drove a non-GAAP operating margin of $103 million this quarter or 6.4% of sales, above our guidance range on the improved performance in June and July. We remain on track to deliver cost savings in the range of $225 million to $250 million, which is reflected in our guidance, which is split fairly evenly between gross margin and SG&amp;A. Key drivers of the savings include non-customer impact initiatives such as product sourcing initiatives through the loop, cloud integration, enhanced credit agreements and advertising efficiencies.Tracking as we expected through the first half of the year, we achieved approximately $75 million of savings. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to close up to 150 stores as part of our fleet optimization efforts over the next 12 months. Approximately 90% of these expected store closures are in mall locations and/or are among the lower performing stores in the UK market. We also expect to open between 30 to 35 new stores, primarily Kay, Jared and Diamond Direct locations, which have bigger stores and higher ATVs than the closures. This means that while our store count will decline by roughly 4%, our total square footage will be similar to the prior year. We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in inventory, which was down $97 million to last year.Inventory, excluding Blue Nile, was down $167 million or 8% and compared to last year and when compared to pre-pandemic, it was down 20%, excluding acquisitions. Our inventory turns at 1.4 times, consistent with the first quarter is 40% improved compared to pre-pandemic. We see opportunities to further improve our turns over time. The health of our inventory has improved significantly over the last four years, with clearance inventory reduced by approximately 50% compared to pre-pandemic, providing room for critical newness within our assortment. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $690 million of cash and equivalents, down $162 million compared to a year ago. Recall that we paid out $200 million in legal settlements in the first quarter as well as acquired Blue Nile last Q3 for nearly $390 million.Excluding those onetime items, we would have increased our cash position by roughly $425 million compared to the prior year. Our forward capital allocation priorities continue to be led by strategic investments to drive organic growth, including $75 million in expenses this year focused on our digital and consumer insight capabilities and up to $200 million in capital investments. Our other three capital allocation priorities include capital returns to shareholders, maintaining a strong balance sheet and small capability building tuck-in acquisitions like SJR Repair. Capital returns to shareholders remain an important part of capital allocation. We repurchased $43.3 million of shares in the quarter or nearly 700,000 shares and have repurchased $82.4 million year-to-date.We had approximately $718 million in remaining repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. This morning, we also declared a $0.23 dividend to common shareholders which, as a reminder, is 15% higher than a year ago, and we believe being a dividend growth company is an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. Within our debt structure, $148 million in bonds are now current, and we anticipate paying those off at maturity next June with cash on hand. The convertible preferred shares, which dilutes our share count by approximately 15% are resumable in November 2024 and we are weighing our options to address those at this time and look forward to sharing those plans when we are able. Turning to guidance. Consistent with my comments last quarter, we continue to anticipate a cautious consumer driven by macro pressure reflected in traffic decreases.We will continue to use strategic levels of promotion to encourage traffic and conversion. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $1.36 billion to $1.41 billion and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10 million to $25 million. The top end of our range assumes comp trends similar to the first half. We continue to expect a deleverage of fixed costs to continue in the third quarter on lower sales. as well as the impact of strategic investments, which will be marginally higher as a percentage of sales in the third quarter due to seasonally slower revenue. We expect to achieve approximately $65 million of cost savings in the third quarter. Of note, Blue Nile becomes comparable beginning in the third quarter. For the full year, we are reaffirming revenue and non-GAAP operating income guidance.Recall that fiscal '24 revenue guidance is in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, and non-GAAP operating income in the range of $635 million to $675 million. We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $9.55 to $10.14, reflecting share repurchases in the second quarter. Recall in the fourth quarter, we believe we will begin a multiyear engagement recovery. We will cycle shutdowns in the UK in the fourth quarter, and our strategic investment impact is lower as a percent of sales due to the seasonally strong holiday revenue. Before we move on to Q&amp;A, I want to thank our team for their focus on the consumer, which enabled us to exceed our revenue and bottom-line commitments in the quarter and advance our strategic priorities.With that, we'll open the line for Q&amp;A.See also 10 Stocks That Are About To Explode and 16 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy Today.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you, Ma’am. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Ike Boruchow: Hey. Okay. Good morning, everyone. I guess two questions from me. Maybe, Joan, just a little bit more, just back to credit, given what's in the headlines of late. Can you just make sure we all understand, like, is there a profit share that's embedded in your credit arrangements today? I know your credit business is very different than what it was five years ago. So, I guess my first question there is, is there a profit share -- and then how do you -- yes or no, how do you think about potential headwinds on your top-line in a tightening credit environment? And then I have a follow-up after that.Joan Hilson: Great. Ike, thanks for the question. As you know, we -- our consumers have access to a broad range of credit through strong partnerships that provide a variety of financing options and it's on a cascading level. We've continued to achieve a financing penetration that's roughly flat year-to-date to last year. It's 44% just to dimension it. And 39% of that is with our private label credit card program. We have guaranteed commitment levels with our financing partners in terms of credit approval. And as you know, we have no consumer credit balance sheet risk, and we have no revenue or loss sharing provisions within our agreement. So while we don't share in -- the credit risk with our credit partners, our partners have indicated that our portfolio delinquency rates are in line with last year. And we also have strong partnerships, including second looks for lower credit scores.Ike Boruchow: Got it. And then just one more follow-up. Just on margin, so can you just kind of -- looking at the back half and specifically to 4Q, can you kind of talk about the bridge of the margin that you've seen in the first half and the improvement or the stabilization you're kind of planning in the back half? Thanks.Joan Hilson: Sure, Ike, thanks for the question. In the first half of the year, we saw a point of impact from Blue Nile, roughly 1 point from strategic investments that of roughly [$75 million] (ph) that we anticipate for the year and 2 points essentially from the deleverage on fixed costs given the lower comp range of double digit. In the third quarter, the strategic investments will be slightly higher impact because of the seasonally lower sales. But for the overall back half, the Blue Nile impact will begin to abate, we'll have less deleverage on fixed costs with improved comp sales in from engagement recovery in UK cycling of the shutdowns and then more cost synergies, particularly in 4Q. This will allow operating margins to improve in the back half of the year.Ike Boruchow: Great. Thanks.Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk to the factors driving the improved fourth quarter sales? And maybe just give us some more clarity on how much benefit you've included from the expected recovery engagements, the lapping of the issues in the UK and any other considerations?Gina Drosos: Sure. Hi, Lorraine. Let me start on that and then, Joan, feel free to jump in. We -- let me go through a little bit what's included in our guidance and what's not included in our guidance. So what is included is an assumption that the overall consumer environment stays the same or even worsens modestly. The cost savings that Joan talked about in her remarks of $225 million to $250 million, which is largely back-ended engagement decline. So we are expecting the -- that engagements will begin to improve. The trough in Q3 and will begin to come up in Q4, but it is a multiyear recovery. So we have assumptions and that engagements will still be below a year ago in the fourth quarter. And we are assuming that the UK cycles, the shutdowns that were in fourth quarter last year.So said a different way, what's not in is we're not assuming improvements in macro trends. We're not assuming weather improvements, and we're not assuming any change in the normal flow-through from sales.Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. And then…Joan Hilson: I was just going to add on the low end of guidance. It allows for softening trends, a softer macro economy or slower recovery engagements might occur and modest higher student loan repayment impact. So just a little bit of modest impact related to that in the low end of our guidance. Sorry, Lorraine, go ahead with your next question.Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Joan, I was just hoping you could talk us through your priorities for cash flow as you enter the back half.Joan Hilson: So as cash flow in the back half, we've talked about the strategic investments that we're making, and there's roughly $75 million of those throughout the year, but we're committed to advancing our strategic priorities. Our intention is to continue with returning capital to shareholders. We announced today our dividend, which is 15% higher than last year this time. And we'll continue to manage our inventories consistent with the advancements that we've made with digital -- with our analytics capabilities. And what's really important about the inventory management is in my remarks, we were 4% down to last year, 8% down, excluding acquisitions, our inventory is healthy, and it's a true strength for us. And so when we look at this, Lorraine, to previous pre-pandemic levels, we're 20% down overall, but 50% down in clearance.Why that's important to our cash flow is that is enabling us to bring in newness that we're excited about. Gina mentioned a number of those ideas within her prepared remarks. So continuing to manage inventory diligently, leveraging analytics, inventory right place, right time, and continuing to manage churn effectively.Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead.Brandon Cheatham: Hey, everyone. It's Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I just want to circle back on like the credit question. Are you seeing any difference in approval rates? I understand that you probably have an agreement that a certain FICO score has to get approved. But are you seeing differences in like the customers that are purchasing on credit? Is there any kind of difference in like the FICO score that they have? And then the amount of customers that are using credit to make purchases, can you give us any details where that is now compared to pre-pandemic, I think during the pandemic that came down, but are you seeing that starting to normalize?Joan Hilson: Thanks, Brandon. With respect to the private label credit card program, as I mentioned, our penetration rate is 39%, and it's really relatively consistent to the prior year, lower than pre-pandemic, we saw a shift in customer usage. Pre-pandemic, it was above 50%. And so we've seen that shift, but that's been relatively consistent over the last couple of years. What we are seeing is that approval rates are consistent in-store but down related to the ability to apply for credit online. So it's really just a shift in channel, but our core 80% of our business in store is relatively consistent with respect to approval rates. What we are also seeing is that the average amount financed has increased to last year, which really is in sync with our average transaction value, including our Blue Nile acquisition is up over the prior year.So amount financed is -- continues to be strong for us. So we're very pleased with the credit portfolio and the work that we're doing to continue to offer a wide variety of options for our customers.Gina Drosos: Yeah. The only thing I'd add is that we do have two financing alternatives that are not FICO dependent. That's progressive leasing and our installment loans kind of pay later split pay with the firm. And those are really catching hold. So I think the way that Joan’s team has built this cascade of financing alternatives is working in our favor.Brandon Cheatham: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then I was wondering if you could talk about like how material costs are trending. I think I've seen diamond prices have started to come down. Does that end up helping your margins? And anything that you can talk about on that?Gina Drosos: There are a couple of things that are helping our margins. That was a good story in the quarter. One is the strategic sourcing efforts that we've put in place. So we work with our vendors, far in advance to make sure that we can get the best pricing on our product. And then that can be passed through to our customers in great value to drive top-line as well as have a bottom-line benefit. So that's an ongoing effort for us. We also have put increasingly more analytics against what we call strategic revenue management. So how we manage the combination of pricing, promotion, discounting and assortment levels at different price points, and that work is really helping the margin. And then finally, it's what Joan talked about, which we have very healthy inventory.And so we're taking marks earlier and not rolling as many things through the clearance, which is a great story. So that's really helped. So in terms of the material cost, we think we're well positioned to kind of continue on the path that we've been on and deliver the strong margins that we've committed to.Brandon Cheatham: Great. Thank you. And, good luck.Gina Drosos: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mauricio Serna from UBS. Please go ahead.Mauricio Serna: Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to ask first about the Q3 sales guidance. Does that like imply any type of divergence in performance if we think about the banners segmented according to price points, the low to mid-tier versus the higher end? And then maybe you could talk about thinking about the Q4 implied operating income guidance, I think it implies a modest operating margin expansion, roughly 30 basis points. Just want to understand if that's like coming both from gross margin improvement and also SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales? Thank you.Gina Drosos: Let me -- hey, Mauricio, let me start first with some of the consumer dynamics that we're seeing. And then, Joan, maybe you can get into the guidance aspect. But from a consumer dynamic, there are really three strategies that we have to address our holiday shoppers this year. There is always an early savvy shopper, typically, a woman typically buying at lower price points, typically comes into the category, September, October and is done with her shopping by Black Friday. We expect that shopper to shop a bit later this year, and we've really structured our marketing, our promotions, our assortment to draw her in early, but also cater to her natural cautious outlook on the economy right now and her desire to get the best deal.Then as we move into the fourth quarter, we see more romantic gifting happened, tends to be at higher price points. We see bridal beginning its three-year recovery. And so I think those are some of the consumer trends that we consistently look at and manage our marketing inventory, store, labor, all of those to meet the consumer where they are during shopping.Joan Hilson: And then with respect to the guidance in Q3, we were pleased with what we saw in June and July. We were pleased with the selling under $1,000. We saw that pick up, particularly in fashion. So we have translated that into our Q3, Q4 guidance as well, Mauricio. So that's a bit underneath the covers from a [folio] (ph) perspective. And we're assuming consistent trends with the first half of the year in Q3. And then as I said, the cycling of UK shutdowns and the beginning of the bridal recovery in Q4 is what's driving some of that increase in the fourth quarter. And then when you think about the front half, back half with respect to the operating margin, as I said in the first half, we had a point of impact from Blue Nile, 1 point from strategic investments and 2 points from the deleverage of fixed costs.So when you look into the back half of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter on stronger seasonal selling in the fourth quarter, the deleverage impact abates. We are also seeing the pressure coming from Blue Nile acquisition begin to abate in the back half. Gina mentioned in her prepared remarks that we've completed the re-platforming for Blue Nile, James Allen, and that was a critical element of us driving the synergies from that acquisition. And that went very well. The team worked very hard to bring that to be with we could start the back half off on the new platform and be able to really harvest those synergies. And then there is some deleverage from -- or some impact related to the strategic investments as well. So overall, that's the dynamic between front half, back half and the improvement that we're seeing in our bank.Mauricio Serna: Got it. Very helpful. And then just very quickly, just one clarification on the Q3 guide, I think you mentioned that this quarter, to Q3, Blue Nile is like already [uncomfortable] (ph). But I think -- I thought like the -- you started like consolidating Blue Nile in September, so I thought we would still get like one-month contribution. Just want to clarify that point. Thanks.Gina Drosos: Yeah. We acquired the Blue Nile on August 18. So there's a couple of weeks of non-comp.Mauricio Serna: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.Gina Drosos: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sanderson from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.Jim Sanderson: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow up on the credit concerns we've heard in the marketplace. I think you had mentioned that your percentage of sales on credit had maintained at 44% in the quarter. Is that correct?Joan Hilson: That is correct.Jim Sanderson: Is that -- I think that's a little bit weaker than prior quarters. How should we look at that slight shift in sales mix.Joan Hilson: It's roughly the same, Jim, from quarter-to-quarter. So we've been very pleased with the penetration. And as I mentioned earlier, the amount finance has increased, we've been able to offer credit online to our customers. And while the approval rate online is not as high in store, we're very pleased with the response to that advancement.Jim Sanderson: All right. And I just had a question about the EBIT margin. I think at the IR Day, you had guided to a midterm goal of about 11%. If we take out the incremental investments made this year in some technology, is that a good run rate for the type of EBIT margin we could achieve -- Signet could achieve next year?Joan Hilson: So just thinking about the Investor Day, that was a midterm goal, which is really three to five years is the dynamics that we wrapped around our goal. What we are doing to drive those increases really related to something Gina just mentioned was strategic revenue management is a key lever for us and really through analytics, understanding the elasticity of pricing and promotion and then also strategic sourcing initiatives that we talked about at the Investor Day where we engage in things with our vendors really driving joint business planning, so that we're driving inventories into our business or receive into our business just in time and with cost transparency. So we're able to optimize our margins. That's a critical lever for us in that growth -- in that margin expansion as well as continuing with the analytics around our very healthy inventories and continuing to drive further productivity there.And then with respect to cost savings and expansion. We will continue to optimize our fleet and assess the right balance of e-commerce and store and really bringing even more to life to connect the commerce experience for our customer. So we're excited about the opportunity to drive into these initiatives over the next several years.Jim Sanderson: Okay. Okay. Understood. And just one last question on the store closures and new unit openings. I think you mentioned potentially, was it a 4% drag on same-store sales related to closures but offset by the incremental revenue from the new store openings for the next 12 months? Is that the right way to look at that balance between openings and closings?Joan Hilson: Yeah. What we said is that the openings, Jim, relate to larger stores and higher volume stores. So that's helping us with the top-line. And then the larger stores is what keeps -- even though we're closing up to 150 and opening 30 to 35, they're larger stores. So therefore, our square footage remains similar to the prior year.Jim Sanderson: Understood. Thank you very much.Joan Hilson: You’re welcome.Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Group. Please go ahead.Dana Telsey: Hi, good morning, everyone. It was encouraging to see that the ATV increased 4% and Blue Nile obviously, being a contributor to that. If you ex out Blue Nile, what did you see throughout the banners, and obviously, lower price point fashion is a big mention. What are you seeing there across the banners, how is the margin profile on that, especially given the strength in the gross margin that we saw this quarter, the opportunity for that to continue? Thank you.Joan Hilson: Thanks, Dana. So [excluding] (ph) Blue Nile, we saw relatively consistent ATV performance to the prior quarter, down slightly -- relatively flat, down slightly is the way I picture that for you. And what contributed to that was we saw a consistent performance in some buckets, some price points, but what we were very pleased with was the improvement in the price points under 1,000 and specific bands over 1,000 were also strong. And we saw that happen more so in June and July. So as we think about that leading into the holiday season, we were very encouraged by that and the response to the fashion assortment that we have. Bridal in and of itself was relatively consistent throughout the quarter as we -- in line with our expectations.And so as we -- and as you know, we are at 50%, roughly 50% penetration in bridal in our business. So as we lean into the recovery of bridal or engagements in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see ATV that have a positive impact on ATV.Dana Telsey: Got it. Thank you. And then any more color on the gross margin, Joan, that you would add for the balance of the year into next year, what's sticky, what's not?Joan Hilson: Yeah. So what we've said is within our cost savings, roughly half of those of the $225 million to $250 million is within gross margin. It really back ended for the year and a significant portion of that just proportionately in the fourth quarter. So that's something that will continue to be a positive for us as we progress through the year. I think inventory health is just another very strong management by our team across all banners. We have very strong inventory discipline in the analytics to tell us right assortment, right place, right timing is we're really leaning into that. And we'll use strategic promotion, as we always do, and we have -- I think Gina mentioned in her prepared remarks that we have items at a price that bring value to our customers, but they've been strategically positioned within our assortment to manage gross margin.Dana Telsey: Thank you.Joan Hilson: We've talked in the past a value engineering that we do with our vendors where we can use off-weight diamonds to construct pieces that offer consumers a better value but also give us a higher margin. So we have a number of strong value-engineered items at a price in this year's holiday assortment.Dana Telsey: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We do have a follow-up question coming from Mauricio Serna from UBS. Please go ahead.Mauricio Serna: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on -- do you have any additional commentary on lab-grown diamonds. There's still like concerns about the impact on price and profitability. I think you alluded to, it has been a benefit to you so far, but maybe what you're seeing across the industry? Or do you have like any concerns going into the back half, a consumer that's still very constrained on their discretionary spending and whether an increasing shift to that particular lab-grown diamonds could affect you at some point? Thanks.Gina Drosos: Thanks, Mauricio. So we are seeing consumers gravitate increasingly to lab-created diamonds. They do offer a great value for customers, especially in the kind of macroeconomic environment that we found ourselves in. And so we're seeing that increase. They still represent a mid-teen percentage of our mix of our diamond mix. So not incredibly significant in that sense. But through our scaled sourcing efforts and the work that we've done on branding, style offerings, special cuts, our LCD items actually carry both a higher margin and a higher ATV than natural diamonds on average. So we believe that our efforts to strategically brand our assortments are working and that consumers who often come in with a budget in mind are actually trading up to higher size or higher-quality lab-created diamonds, which gives them an even more beautiful look and creates great lifetime relationship potential for us.So our teams have done a terrific job making that a higher margin and higher ATV offering for us.Mauricio Serna: Great. Thank you so much.Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Gina Drosos, CEO, for any closing remarks.Gina Drosos: Well, thank you again for joining us today. We continue to navigate this pressured environment and are confident in our capabilities. We're leaning in to widen our competitive advantages to drive market share growth.

Also, same-store sales fell 12% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s levels.This presently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player’s shares have gained 14.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 5.4% growth.Quarterly DetailsSignet reported adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. However, the bottom line decreased from $2.68 in the year-ago fiscal quarter.Signet Jewelers Limited Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSignet Jewelers Limited Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSignet Jewelers Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Signet Jewelers Limited QuoteThis jewelry retailer generated total sales of $1,613.6 million, ahead of the consensus estimate of $1,560 million. Yet, the top line dipped 8.1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s tally due to soft same-store sales. The metric tumbled 8.2% at constant currency.A Sneak Peek Into MarginsGross profit in the fiscal second quarter came in at $610.8 million, down from $664.7 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter.Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses reached $511.2 million, up from $477.3 million in the prior-year fiscal quarter. SIG reported adjusted operating income of $102.7 million, down from $193.2 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter. As a rate of sales, adjusted operating margin contracted 460 basis points to 6.4%.Segment DiscussionSales in the North American segment fell 7.1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s number to $1.5 billion. This reflected a rise of 4.4% in total average transaction value (""ATV""), mainly owing to a lift from Blue Nile of about 5% on a lower number of transactions. Same-store sales tumbled 12.2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s levels.Sales in the International segment tumbled 8.6% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter to $102 million. Same-store sales slipped 8.4%, reflecting impacts of increased ATVs and lower transactions. Sales fell 11.6% on a constant-currency basis.Story continuesFinancial DetailsSignet ended the quarter under discussion with cash and cash equivalents of $690.2 million, accounts receivable of $16.8 million and inventories of $2,093.9 million.

SIG’s board has announced a quarterly cash dividend of 23 cents per share for the second quarter, payable on Nov 24, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Oct 27, with an ex-dividend date of Oct 26, 2023.We note that Signet had 2,761 stores as of Jul 29, 2023.GuidanceSignet issued guidance for the third quarter and reiterated view for fiscal 2024, which is a 53-week fiscal year. For the third quarter, it projects total sales in the band of $1.36-$1.41 billion.  Operating income is anticipated in the range of $10-$25 million.For the current fiscal year, it continues to forecast total sales in the band of $7.10-$7.30 billion.

In fiscal 2023, it recorded EPS of $11.80.Management expects capital investments of up to $200 million along with investments in banner differentiation with stores, connected-commerce capabilities, and digital and technology upgrades.The company’s guidance is based on assumptions, which include the annual US Jewelry industry’s revenues to decline over mid-single digits, persistent headwinds in engagements with recovery later in fiscal 2024 and an annual tax rate of around 19%. We note that bridal overall, inclusive of engagements, historically reflects nearly 50% of the company’s merchandise sales.

CEO Rosalind Brewer and the company have agreed to mutually part ways. It comes about a month after the company's CFO announced their departure. Meanwhile, the CEO of Amazon-owned (AMZN) One Medical is going to leave the company. Amir Dan Rubin will be stepping down later this year. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the latest executive shakeups in the health care world.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Roz Brewer out as Walgreens CEO after less than three years on the job. The stock sliding to a 14-year low. Anjalee Khemlani is here with the details. Anj, we're looking at a loss of 7%.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. And, of course, the loss of CEO Roz Brewer just coming weeks after they lost their CFO James Kehoe. So it's really two top spots at the company now vacant with searches to fill. Now, Roz Brewer didn't really give any indication. This comes a little bit as a surprise to many.But Evercore ISI analyst did say that the timing while could be a surprise does seem to fit with what Walgreens is moving into, which is their health care segment growth as a vertical and may make more sense for someone who has that health care experience to be in the top spot or at least the top two as a team, as the company moves away from being just a retail pharmacy giant.If you know, Roz's background, we know that she has been in retail for quite a number of years with Walmart and Starbucks, so it does make sense to move. But there really was no indication in the LinkedIn post just the day before.Roz was talking about having a leadership meeting and saying, quote, ""Our new fiscal year begins Friday. And I'm excited for what's to come."" So no indication there that she was thinking about leaving, at least on that note. So definitely comes a surprise.We've seen Walgreens struggle with returning to what was a focus in 2019 prepandemic, if you remember those days, which was front of store sales getting more prescriptions filled. And so that remains a concern now for the company as its COVID windfall wanes, which we've seen for other pharmacies as well.Story continuesBut if you compare it to, say, competitor CVS, you know, they've also pivoted to being more of a health care services company. So definitely a shift in what we know as modern day retail giantsAKIKO FUJITA: And, Anjalee, another big shakeup at least we're seeing in the health space, Amazon's One Medical facing a CEO transition. What's happening there?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So Amir Dan Rubin who had been a part of the company's-- not founding, but since 2017 had been with the health care startup, saw its transition through the Amazon deal, 3.9 billion there. Just stepping down or at least announcing that he's going to step down later this year. That doesn't come as too much of a surprise if you've seen what's happened with CEOs of companies that Amazon has acquired.If you take a look back, PillPack, for example, the founders there, as well as Ring and Twitch, those two founders also leaving just months after the deal last year, I believe is when all of these happened. So you see that transition happening even though at the time of the acquisitions, the note did say they'd be staying on.

The initial burst of buying power quickly faded, however, with many market participants likely checking out early ahead of the long holiday weekend.As a reminder, both the stock and bond markets are closed this Monday for the Labor Day holiday.Taking a closer look at this morning's nonfarm payrolls data shows the U.S. added 187,000 new jobs in August. While this figure came in above economists' estimates, it was below the downwardly revised June and July payroll increases. Average hourly earnings – a measure of inflation that's tracked by the Federal Reserve – also rose at a slower pace than the prior two months, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.8% from 3.5% in July.""Overall, this report tells you that the economy is growing and normalizing,"" says Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group, an advisory firm with over $21 billion in assets under management. ""Employment growth is more than enough to keep up with population growth, worker hours are rising and wage growth is easing. And the big picture is that there's no recession right, nor are we close to one right now barring unforeseen shocks.""As for the impact today's jobs report had on rate-hike expectations, futures traders are now pricing in a 93% probability the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at its September meeting, up from yesterday's 88%, according to CME Group. Chances for a November rate hike ticked slightly higher, to 38.3% from 37.1%.Walgreens sinks as CEO splitsWhile today's attention was squarely focused on the August jobs report and what it could mean for the Fed moving forward, there were some noteworthy single-stock headlines that hit the newswires.Among them were reports that Rosalind Brewer will be stepping down as CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) after nearly three years on the job. While the news was unexpected, the decision was ""mutually agreed"" upon by both Brewer and the retail pharmacy chain's board of directors, according to a press release. Ginger Graham, current lead independent director at Walgreens, will serve as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.Story continuesThis is just the latest C-suite shakeup for Walgreens, which in July announced the departure of its chief financial officer. Notably, the move comes alongside the company's warning that adjusted earnings for the fiscal year ended August 31 will likely arrive at the low end of guidance. The blue chip stock slumped 7.4% today in reaction, bringing its year-to-date decline to more than 37%. WBA is the worst-performing Dow Jones stock so far in 2023.Elsewhere, Broadcom (AVGO) reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of $10.54 per share on revenue of $8.88 billion – both of which beat analysts' forecasts. However, the semiconductor stock fell 5.5% with Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers saying investors were expecting stronger guidance around the company's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.As for the major market indexes, the Nasdaq Composite ended marginally lower at 14,031.81, while the S&amp;P 500 (+0.2% at 4,515) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.3% at 34,837) closed modestly higher.Related contentWhen Is the Next Fed Meeting?Stock Market Holidays in 2023Kiplinger's Weekly Earnings Calendar for This Week]"

There are now two top positions vacant at the retail pharmacy giant as it continues to shift to a focus on health services.JPM analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note Friday that the search for either the CEO or CFO should include a focus on healthcare — which Brewer, notably, did not have in her background.""With WBA still in the midst of its healthcare-centric transformation, we view continued leadership uncertainty as adding to investor concerns. Given the company’s focus on healthcare going forward, we would expect that either the new CEO and CFO (or preferably both) would have healthcare backgrounds,"" Gill wrote.Evercore ISI analysts said in a note that while the move may have taken some by surprise, it makes sense as the company's broader health portfolio grows.""With the increased focus on growing the Walgreens Healthcare segment as a growth vertical to offset the core business’s profit challenges (hopefully starting in FY24), it makes sense to retrench and search for a new leadership team with more extensive backgrounds in healthcare services,"" the analysts said.Then-Starbucks COO Roz Brewer talks about the proposed redesign of a Starbucks store in New Jersey during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle Wednesday, March 20, 2019.

The company acquired a majority stake in VillageMD in 2021, which subsequently inked a $9 billion deal for medical group Summit Health.Story continuesIn addition, the company is building out a clinical trials service, aimed at increasing diversity in the space. It's an area Walgreens currently has a leg up, as competitor CVS (CVS) backed out earlier this year.But like its competitors, Walgreens has had to contend with a decline in COVID-related demand, downgrading its outlook for the year. With waning demand for tests and vaccines, the company has returned to its pre-pandemic struggles of finding ways to increase prescription fill and get more customers in the door to buy front-of-store products.Abrupt departureThe company declined to expand on the news, and the timing appeared to be a surprise.Brewer had just wrapped up a leadership meeting Thursday, according to a post on LinkedIn, in which she gave no indication of the move. Brewer appeared to indicate staying with the company.""I left the meeting energized and grateful for all our team members who each play such a critical role in delivering our vision to reimagine local healthcare. Our new fiscal year begins Friday, and I’m excited for what’s to come,"" she wrote.On Friday morning, she wrote about the departure, saying it was one of the most difficult notes she has ever written.""This decision did not come without great consideration for what is best for all of you, our shareholders, customers, patients, and my family. In the near-term, I will continue to advise the Board as they search for a permanent CEO with healthcare expertise,"" Brewer wrote.The news pressured the company's stock Friday, with shares trading down nearly 7% in the session.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceCorrection: A previous version of this article listed incorrect dates for Roz Brewer's employment with Sam's Club.

In the past year, the stock has lost 14.9% compared with the industry’s 5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s discuss the factors that might continue to affect the firm’s near-term performance.Soft Industry Trend: Sysco witnessed slower overall industry market volume growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Although Sysco’s size and scale advantages and strong balance sheet position it for growth in fiscal 2024, the company expects the market to grow at a lower rate than fiscal 2023. This might put pressure on the company’s volumes, which, in turn, might affect sales.Escalating Costs and Expenses: The company has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. For instance, in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023, the company witnessed product cost inflation of 4.9% and 2.1%, respectively, measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the frozen, canned and dry categories.In fiscal 2023, its cost of sales and operating expenses recorded increases of 10.8% and 9%, respectively. Sysco expects its International segment to remain inflationary in fiscal 2024. Escalation in operating costs and expenses, if not controlled, might continue to affect SYY’s margins and profitability in the quarters ahead.Currency Woes: Given its widespread presence in international markets, Sysco is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movements. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company’s International Foodservice operations contributed 18.5% of its total revenues. However, in the quarter, foreign exchange headwinds had an adverse impact of 0.2% and 0.1% on the overall top line and gross profit, respectively. A stronger U.S. dollar might further depress SYY's overseas business results in the quarters ahead.High Tax Rate: For fiscal 2024, Sysco expects the tax rate to be approximately 24.5%, higher than 23% in fiscal 2023. A higher tax rate might hurt the company’s margins and profitability in fiscal 2024.Southbound Estimate Trend: In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised down by 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively.Story continuesSome Solid Staple BetsInter Parfums IPAR, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company’s   steady lineup of product launches is likely to help retain its business momentum. It is anticipated to reap gains from its strong distribution network in international markets and investments in growth opportunities.Backed by these trends, Monster Beverage’s top and bottom lines improved year over year in second-quarter 2023. Monster Beverage’s earnings advanced 50% year over year, while sales improved 12%. Results gained from the expansion of the energy drinks category and product launches.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a market capitalization of $60.9 billion. In the past year, shares of the company have gained 29.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 12.4%. The stock also outpaced the sector and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 0.5% and 15.1%, respectively, in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Monster Beverage’s 2023 sales and earnings suggests growth of 13.7% and 37.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Driving GrowthMonster Beverage’s continued momentum in the energy drinks category remains a key growth driver. We note that the company offers a wide range of energy drink brands, such as Monster Energy, Java Monster, Cafe Monster, Espresso Monster, Monster Energy Mule, Juice Monster Pipeline Punch, Juice Monster Pacific Punch, Juice Monster Mango Loco, Monster Ultra Paradise, and Monster Hydra Sport. In second-quarter 2023, the Monster Energy Drinks segment's net sales increased 9.7% year over year to $1.7 billion.Product innovation plays a significant role in the company's success. Monster Beverage remains committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. In second-quarter 2023, the company launched many products and expanded distribution in the international markets.In the second quarter, Monster Beverage continued with the roll-out of its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, The Beast Unleashed, in the United States and received positive feedback. Consequently, MNST is on track with the expansion of the distribution of The Beast Unleashed into additional markets, with plans for nationwide distribution by the end of the year. It intends to launch a hard iced tea extension of The Beast Unleashed, named Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea, later this year or early next year, with a target of nationwide distribution in the first half of 2024. The brand will be available in four flavors — Original, Half &amp; Half, Razzleberry and Green.Moreover, Monster Energy is on track with price increases to wean the ongoing cost pressures. It has been implementing price hikes from the first half of 2022. It continued to implement price hikes in the second quarter of 2023, with additional price hikes planned in many other markets through the remainder of 2023. In some markets, this rise was in addition to price increases implemented in 2022.In the United States, management implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 oz and 24 oz energy drinks, effective Apr 1, 2023.The company’s pricing actions, along with reduced freight costs, have been aiding the gross and operating margins. In second-quarter 2023, Monster Beverage’s gross margin expanded 540 basis points (bps) to 52.5%, driven by pricing actions, lower freight-in costs and reduced aluminum can costs. The operating margin expanded 570 bps to 28.2% on an improved gross margin. The persistence of this trend may contribute to the company’s profitability.Story continuesWhat Holds MNST Back?Monster Beverage has been witnessing rising SG&amp;A expenses due to increased payroll expenses. Also, the persistence of certain supply-chain headwinds has been a deterrent. Operating expenses grew 10.7% year over year in the second quarter mainly due to increased payroll expenses. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, expanded 20 bps year over year to 9.3%. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, expanded 40 bps year over year to 10.6%.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX, Ambev ABEV and PepsiCo Inc.

Compared with the year-ago quarter, revenues were up 6.5% on a reported basis and 6.9% on a constant-currency basis.Quarterly DetailsAmdocs’ top-line performance was primarily driven by continued strength in North America and healthy activity levels among top consumers in Europe. However, foreign currency movements subdued the figure.North America reported record revenues of $831 million (67.2% of the total revenues), highlighting a 5.4% year-over-year increase. Europe revenues (15.2% of the total revenues) of $187 million increased 28.2% year over year. Rest of the World revenues (17.6% of the total revenues) fell 3.7% year over year to $217.8 million. Our model estimates for North America, Europe and Rest of the World were pegged at $837.8 million, $164.3 million and $228.5 million, suggesting growth of 6.3%, 12.5% and 1%, respectively.Managed services revenues grew 0.3% year over year to $720 million. The company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with a 12-month backlog of $4.14 billion, up $30 million sequentially and $190 million year over year. Our model estimates for managed services revenues and backlog were pegged at $741 million and $4.19 billion, respectively.Story continuesThe non-GAAP operating income increased 7.8% year over year to $220 million, while the operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 17.8%. The year-over-year improvement in the non-GAAP operating margin was mainly driven by the company’s consistent project execution and ongoing efficiency gains.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAmdocs had cash and short-term investments of $749.5 million as of Jun 30, 2023 compared with $861.6 million as of Mar 31, 2023.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $172.6 million, down from $294.4 million in the previous quarter and up from $166.8 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow was $144 million compared with the previous quarter’s $259.4 million and the year-earlier quarter’s $125.9 million.During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $550.3 million and free cash flow was $452.5 million.In the fiscal third quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $129 million and paid out $52 million in dividends. Amdocs’ board approved the new increased quarterly cash dividend rate of 43.5 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on Oct 27, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Sep 29.FY23 Guidance UpdateFor fiscal 2023, the company now anticipates revenue growth of 6.3-7.1% on a reported basis, which tightened from the previous guidance range of 6-8%. On a constant-currency basis, revenues are projected to increase in the band of 7.2-8% year over year compared with previously estimated 7-9% band.The updated fiscal 2023 outlook reflects an expected unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 0.9% on a year-over-year basis compared with the previous forecast of roughly 1%. Adjusted earnings are now estimated to grow in the 11-12% band, which tightened from the previous range of 9-13%.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company projects revenues between $1.220 billion and $1.260 billion and adjusted earnings in the range of $1.38-$1.44 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -6.57% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Amdocs has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Amdocs has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerAmdocs belongs to the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry.

74,aedc90b6-c7fc-38d0-ba43-c88b70644bd5,TDG,2023-09-02,TransDigm (TDG) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transdigm-tdg-upgraded-strong-buy-160005992.html,1693584005,STORY,['TDG'],"[Investors might want to bet on TransDigm Group (TDG), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for TransDigm is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for TransDigm imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for TransDigmThis aircraft components maker is expected to earn $25.31 per share for the fiscal year ending September 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 47.7%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for TransDigm. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7.9%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of TransDigm to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

77,5deff926-017c-3b27-b994-52ff2e964975,HCA,2023-09-02,Community Health Systems (CYH) Down 31.3% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/community-health-systems-cyh-down-153144622.html,1693582304,STORY,"['CYH', 'HCA']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Community Health Systems (CYH). Shares have lost about 31.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Community Health Systems due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Community Health Q2 Earnings Top on Rising AdmissionsCommunity Health reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted loss of 22 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 29 cents. The reported loss was also narrower than the prior-year quarter’s loss of $2.52 per share.Net operating revenues increased 6.2% year over year to $3,115 million in the quarter under review. The top line beat the consensus mark by 3.2%.The quarterly results benefited from rising patient volumes, admissions and improved occupancy rates. However, declining patient days, length of stay and rising expenses partially offset the negatives.Quarterly Operational UpdateAt the second-quarter end, the hospital count for Community Health was 78, missing our estimate by 1.3%.Patient days tumbled 2.4% year over year. The average length of stay fell 2.2% year over year, while the occupancy rate of 49.3% improved 200 basis points year over year.Admissions grew 0.9% year over year. Meanwhile, adjusted admissions also advanced 0.9% year over year in the quarter under review. On a same-store basis, admissions and adjusted admissions improved 4.8% and 4.9%, respectively, from their corresponding prior-year quarter’s reported figures.Licensed beds of Community Health totaled 12,735 as of Jun 30, 2023, which indicates a decrease of 606 beds from the prior-year quarter. The reported figure missed our estimate by 4.1%.Total operating costs and expenses increased 1.9% year over year to $2,869 million in the second quarter, higher than our estimate of $2,768.3 million. The increase was mainly due to higher salaries and benefits, supplies and lease costs and rent. Meanwhile, net interest expenses of $207 million declined 5% year over year. The metric came higher than our estimate of $200.7 million.Story continuesCommunity Health reported a net loss of $2 million, narrower than the prior-year quarter loss of $298 million. Adjusted EBITDA improved 47.4% year over year to $373 million in the quarter under review primarily due to improved inpatient and outpatient volumes, higher acuity and lower contract labor costs. The metric beat our estimate by 11.7%.Financial Update (as of Jun 30, 2023)Community Health exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $118 million, which was unchanged from the figure at 2022-end. Total assets of $14,648 million declined from $14,669 million at 2022-end.Long-term debt amounted to $11,728 million, which increased from $11,614 million at 2022-end. Current maturities of long-term debt were $30 million.In the first half of 2023, Community Health generated operating cash flows of $91 million, up from $63 million year over year.2023 View ReaffirmedThe company reiterated its guidance for 2023, which it had provided in the prior quarter. It expects net operating revenues between $12,200 million and $12,600 million for 2023, the mid-point of which indicates a rise of 1.5% from the 2022 reported figure of $12,211 million.Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be in the range of $1,475-$1,625 million. The mid-point of the guidance implies a 5.7% rise from the 2022 figure of $1,466 million.Net loss per share is expected to be between 5 cents and 65 cents in 2023. Community Health reported a net loss of $1.38 per share in 2022.Depreciation and amortization are predicted to be in the range of $510-$530 million. Net interest expense is estimated to be in the $815-$835 million band.Net cash from operating activities is anticipated to be between $675 million and $825 million in 2023. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $450 and $500 million. Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are estimated to be in the range of $130-131 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 11.71% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Community Health Systems has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Community Health Systems has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCommunity Health Systems belongs to the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry.

79,13e60da6-236d-3cce-bcb8-c0ad1d6d4981,HCA,2023-09-02,"Is Most-Watched Stock HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-hca-healthcare-130011693.html,1693573211,STORY,['HCA'],"[HCA Healthcare (HCA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this hospital operator have returned +2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, to which HCA belongs, has gained 0.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.HCA is expected to post earnings of $4.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.2%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.22 indicates a change of +9.6% from what HCA is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for HCA.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of HCA, the consensus sales estimate of $15.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.9%. The $63.92 billion and $67.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.1% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHCA reported revenues of $15.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. EPS of $4.29 for the same period compares with $4.21 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.84%. The EPS surprise was +0.23%.Over the last four quarters, HCA surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.HCA is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about HCA. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This indicated that the labor market was cooling down and easing inflation pressures.Meanwhile, lack of hawkish surprises in comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium last week buoyed stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.11%, while the two-year note yield dropped below 5%. Interest rate futures also showed that investors were betting that the Fed would keep rates unchanged at its September meeting and had a more than 50% chance of doing so until November, per a Reuters article.Impact of Interest Rates on Medtech IndustryThe healthcare industry and medical device companies are not immune to the effects of interest rates.First, cost and availability of finances are affected by interest rates, making new equipment purchases, facility investments, research, development and acquisitions more expensive, all of which negatively impact healthcare providers and medical device manufacturers. Conversely, lower interest rates make borrowing more economical and convenient, leading to more investment and innovation in the healthcare industry.Second, higher interest rates may lower the demand for medical resources and healthcare services, as consumers may save more and spend less. This may affect the demand for medical equipment and optional healthcare services that are not covered by insurance or government programs. Lower interest rates may have the opposite effect, as consumers may have more money and spend additionally on healthcare services and elective medical equipment that improve health and lifestyle.Story continuesLastly, higher interest rates lower the present value of healthcare companies' future cash flows, which may reduce their stock prices and market value. Higher interest rates also make healthcare stocks less attractive, as investors may prefer other assets with higher returns. Lower interest rates have the opposite effect, as they increase the present value of healthcare companies' future cash flows, which may boost their stock prices and market value. Lower interest rates also make healthcare stocks more appealing, as investors may choose them over other assets with lower returns.Stock PicksHere we provide three medical device stocks — HCA Healthcare HCA, Alcon Inc. ALC &amp; Select Medical SEM — which are likely to benefit from rate hike pause as it will lower interest expense, provide better financing options for capex for businesses as well as for customers to purchase equipment, and improve present value of cash flows.These stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each, which makes them an attractive bet for investors.

Guest checkout actually refers to the execution of transactions on e-commerce platforms without saving the card credentials of cardholders. ALT ID, a tailored capability developed by Mastercard’s security systems, generates an alternate identifier for each of the card numbers provided by cardholders on merchant websites. This, in turn, infuses more security into the guest checkout transactions and provides a greater peace of mind to both merchants and consumers. The ongoing digitization trend, that shows no mood of slowing down, offers innumerous benefits to merchants and consumers of the world.But the trend to go digital often invites sophisticated methods of cybercrimes, which compromise payments received by merchants and the confidential data of consumers. This, in turn, might lead to the incurrence of exorbitant costs.As the solution preserves the confidentiality of card numbers, more number of cardholders are likely to get encouraged to opt for online shopping and stay abreast with the digitization trend. Meanwhile, merchants and payment service providers will benefit from seamless integration of the ALT ID solution within their online platforms, an upgraded customers’ payment experience and improved payment success rates.Some of the Indian payment solution providers that have announced the adoption of the ALT ID solution include Juspay, PayU and Razorpay.Launching of such beneficial solutions may widen Mastercard's customer base in India as well as fetch greater revenues from the increased utilization of its solutions. The country seems to be an attractive market for the tech giant for infusing greater digitization, owing to the elevated Internet penetration, increased smartphone usage and several government initiatives to boost the nation’s digital growth. This August, Mastercard unveiled the Mastercard Strive India, which will leverage tie-ups with trade associations, non-profits, and government agencies to enable the country’s micro-enterprises, women-owned and led businesses and agri-entrepreneurs easily adopt digital means.Story continuesMA boasts a solid hold on the worldwide digital payments market and its robust digital arm built on partnerships and investments has played a pivotal role in achieving this position. The tech giant actively pursues tie-ups with payment service providers, merchants, acquirers and financial institutions to infuse frictionless payment experiences across different parts of the globe.Shares of Mastercard have gained 28% in a year compared with the industry’s 16% rise.

While service activities are currently in good shape, their positive impacts on the sector are being partially offset by contracting economic activity in the manufacturing sector.The Services PMI measured by the Institute for Supply Management has stayed above the 50% mark for the past seven consecutive months, indicating continued expansion. The manufacturing PMI stayed below the 50% mark for the past nine consecutive months.The broader economy is showing signs of revival. According to the ""advance"" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023 compared with the 2% growth in the first quarter.The global macroeconomic environment, strong demand for services, improving supply chains, a less-hawkish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, and strong digital adoption are currently some of the crucial drivers of the business services sector, which are decreasing the negative impacts of labor market constraints and higher operational expenses.Sector-specific factors acting as tailwinds are the essentiality of certain services like waste management, the rise in demand for risk mitigation and consulting services, increased expertise in improving operational efficiency and lower costs, successful work-from-home models and digital transformation.Story continuesThe pandemic has changed the way players have conducted business and delivered services.

90,37a46f0f-84cc-37cc-b347-bf3510d09b32,PRGO,2023-09-02,How to Maximize Your Retirement Portfolio with These Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/maximize-retirement-portfolio-top-ranked-131002497.html,1693573802,STORY,['PRGO'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.New Jersey Resources (NJR) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.39 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.7%. This compares to the Utility - Gas Distribution industry's yield of 3.68% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.66%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 7.59%. Check New Jersey Resources (NJR) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Perrigo (PRGO) is paying out a dividend of $0.27 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.12% compared to the Medical - Products industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5% over the past year. Check Perrigo (PRGO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.25 per share, Prudential (PRU) has a dividend yield of 5.28%. This is compared to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 1.96% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 4.17%. Check Prudential (PRU) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

93,fff06e6a-8948-3523-b217-b2bbb3a97f04,NFLX,2023-09-02,"Hollywood strikes: ‘Focus on the consumer,’ MNTN CEO says",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-strikes-focus-consumer-mntn-155910504.html,1693583950,VIDEO,"['AAPL', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'NFLX', 'AMZN', 'WBD', 'DIS', 'CMCSA']","[There are several issues writers and Hollywood studios are battling over in their contract talks including streaming, AI, and writers’ rooms. Recently, media mogul Barry Diller warned of consequences for studios if they continue partnering with streaming companies like Netflix (NFLX). MNTN CEO Mark Douglas joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the comments.“If you look at the economics on it, I’m not sure how that quite works,” Douglas says. Douglas notes that Disney (DIS) “did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year,” whereas Netflix (NFLX) did “three times that, just by themselves. So they’re the size of like a couple of major studios combined, so I don’t know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out.”“Whenever these studios are in trouble, it’s like the finance team takes over and it just doesn’t make sense,” Douglas says. “These studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses.Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it. And so, bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and... we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry in a healthy state,” Douglas adds.Video Transcript- Well, key issues between Hollywood writers and studios still linger as the strike heads into its fifth month. But media mogul Barry Diller warning of catastrophic consequences should Hollywood studios continue to partner with streaming giants like Netflix, even calling it the architect of the strike on Kara Swisher's podcast. So who's poised to take on Netflix as the strike continues. Mark Douglas, MNTN CEO, joins us now. Mark, great to have you here with us in studio.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.- I mean, these comments are sending shockwaves right now through the equity price action of some of the largest streamers and some of them former linear powerhouses in television as well. I mean, what do you make of the comments here and could we really see some type of new negotiation process where the different studios are trying to keep Netflix out of the conversation.Story continuesMARK DOUGLAS: Well, if you look at the economics on it, I'm not sure how that quite works. So like look at Disney, for example. They did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year. Netflix is three times that just by themselves. So the size of like a couple of major studios combined. So I don't know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out, and that's like the writers and the actors that kind think that makes sense.I think the other thing you see from the comments is that whenever these studios are in trouble, it's like the finance team takes over and it just doesn't make sense. I was talking to a friend last night, I was like if we were in a restaurant, like if this restaurant had like fewer people in it, you don't call your accountant.- No.MARK DOUGLAS: You call the chef. So I think these studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference. Like ""Oppenheimer,"" three hours, I want to see it at home, I don't want to go in the theater, I'm actually willing to pay more. This is also not new. All this talk was on DVDs, you know, what, 20, 30 years ago. Every time there's a new technology, it's like everyone's up in arms over it. And so bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry and the healthy state.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Mark, Rachelle here.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.RACHELLE AKUFFO: As we look at Netflix, obviously holding the crown here, but then when you think of who is the next best contender, because Amazon has an interesting market there because it's usually people subscribing for Amazon not necessarily for the streaming content, it's because they've already got it for the shopping or something else. Who would be the next closest contender to a Netflix?MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I think a lot of people are thinking maybe Apple, mainly because Apple has essentially the dollars to lead a consolidation. I'm not sure that it actually makes sense for Apple because Apple's more focused on a bundle.Remember, Apple not only has Apple TV, they have Apple Music, Apple News, Apple games. And so what Apple wants is they want $20 a month from every iPhone user in the world. And they don't have to create content for music, they don't have to create content for games or for news, but they are clearly positioned, if there's going to be a consolidation, they are the ones that can lead it. Whether that makes sense for Apple as a company I'm not so sure. But they're in the best next position.I agree with you. I don't think Amazon-- that there's a lot of reasons there for Amazon to lead a consolidation of a bunch of these studios- You were talking about ""Oppenheimer"" a moment ago.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.- That's a film that was already in the can, promotion had already been done.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.- So by when now do many of the talks for strikes and negotiations need to be netted out by.MARK DOUGLAS: So until the actors strike, you could still film, even though the writers were on strike. And so I think when the actors went on strike, that literally has shut things down. I mean, if you look back on COVID, I mean, they went quite a while without new content and still were able to survive that. So you're looking I think Q1 and Q2 before like consumers are affected in terms of they can't get the content they want.And there are a lot of big shows out now. You have ""Billions"" out. You have new seasons on all these streamers. So I think the fall and the winter is taken care of. By the summer-- by the spring-- I mean, I'm sorry, by the early next year it's really going to start to affect the funnel of content that comes out and it's going to start to become a big problem.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Mark, who do you think is most at risk in terms of losing brand loyalty. Obviously you've got consumers trying to pinch some pennies here, there might be one or two streaming services that they're going to hold on to. But then manufacturing things like live sports coming into the mix, who do you think is going to have the best brand loyalty out of the streamers.MARK DOUGLAS: Well, it's always Netflix without a doubt. The reason why is Netflix is where you go when you're not looking for your favorite show. Like I think most people I know and I'd say this for myself, when I turn on my TV, the first thing I do is see what's on Netflix. So they're positioned very well. Second thing I want is sports content, which comes from like Hulu, YouTube, TV.In the third slot, I think Disney. Everyone thought they had that locked up with Disney. Plus, but Disney has stumbled quite a bit. Their ""Star Wars"" content is lagging. So I think it's kind of a toss up. And a lot of people, their behavior is, well, I'll binge on Disney for three months, then I'll binge on Showtime for three months. I'll binge on Max. And so that third slot I think is the really where a lot of the competition is.The first slot, I mean, Netflix just has it on lock. They have muscle memory. Meaning you turn on your TV and you just go for Netflix. And so I think that's going to be hard for anyone to overcome.- Well, for a lot of sports fans out there, they tend to have the second spot that they go to where their team is playing. And I mean, as we're beginning NFL season. Of course, there's a different type of football that's capturing attention, there's Messi now playing in the MLS, and Apple has those rights for broadcasting and for streaming. So is the Messi effect taking hold? Is that as effective as Apple was hoping and intended it to be in this battle for some of these streaming rights for sports right now?MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, so the way I think to always think of Apple is they don't want the fee for Apple Plus, they want the fee for the Apple bundle. So they're always going to try to put in enough content that you'll just go for the whole bundle. Basically you'll switch from Spotify to Apple Music, if you're a Spotify user.And so I think they've gone after sports, Messi made a lot of sense for them. He's like taken over-- I live in Miami. He's taken over. You see you see posters for him everywhere in Miami. So people really love that. But I don't think you'll see Apple like kind of keep going further, because their bar is to stay on track for that 19.99 a month bundle for all the services. And everyone has to remember, for three of those, they have no production costs whatsoever, right? They're just streaming music, they're not making the music. So it's particularly profitable for them.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as a football fan, if I was going to sign up for that Apple streaming service, it would be maybe just to watch Messi play, but chances are afterwards, I probably wouldn't use the service anymore. I probably would disconnect it. But I do want to ask you, in terms of losing magic, I have to ask you about Disney Plus and how do you see their streaming strength going forward?MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I mean, they have the assets, the question is, is do they want to invest in them. I mean, they've kind of actually said they're de-emphasizing ""Star Wars"" a bit. Obviously they have Marvel Studios. I think Disney as a company has a lot of strength. They have all the sports I mean, if you own ESPN, I mean, to some extent you almost own sports. They have all the children's programming, family programming. And for some reason, they just seem to not be able to bundle it together in a way that they keep growing the subscribers. I think they'll figure it out. Bob Iger is obviously, a strong leader.And Disney, if you look at their revenue, it's gone up consistently over the last 10 years. Its profitability where they've stumbled. In 2019, they were doing something like $12 billion in profits, and now they're doing three, even though their revenue is higher. So I think for Disney, it's like do 10% more with 10% less. Fix the profits and just keep giving consumers what they want. That's the bottom line.- We got to go. If there's one name that you think wins out the advertising play here now with all these streaming services adding in that tier, who is it?MARK DOUGLAS: I think over the long term, it's definitely Netflix, but in the short term, I think NBC is actually a lot stronger than most people give them credit for.- All right.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, thanks so much. Mark Douglas there, MNTN CEO. Thank you for joining us this morning.]"

But there's still a lot of uncertainty about what current existing monetary policy will likely mean in the next several quarters. Do you think there's a bit of complacency that's kicked in?JEFF BIERMAN: No, I think there's a tremendous amount of complacency that's kicked in, Akiko. As a matter of fact, I call this the sweet charity market like from the 1967 film. And there's a song in there that says, hey, big spender.Now, I listen to your piece before where you said, hey, look, spending has come in a little bit on some of the high-ticket items like Tesla, some of the things like NIO. There's also been a sort of a slowdown in spending and travel in terms of airlines, in terms of lodging, things like Marriott, Hilton, Airbnb. They've all come in about 15% to 20%. And so I can see some of the big-ticket items have come in terms of travel services and what I call a status.But one thing has not slowed down, Akiko, is the spending in what I call technology or in designer brands whatsoever. You're looking at stocks-- TJ Maxx, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Lululemon-- these high status kind of companies, brand designers. They just never tick down. People continue to spend regardless of the actual rate hikes that have occurred.Story continuesI'm not sure exactly why. But at some point, consumers are going to have to look at their credit card balances and think to themselves, well, if I don't pay off at the end of the month, what might be the ramifications? And their balances are going to build.And the other side of this is, this is the lowest savings rate in the United States in over 40 years. We're down at about 2.5% to 3%. So everybody's pretty much tapped out on his or her credit cards. So although spending has been curbed in some areas, it's not being curbed in all areas.And with the low savings rate, to me, it spells some type of like corrective mode that's going to take place if we cannot maintain jobs at a certain high level. So expect the job number to slow down. Expect spending to slow down. It's just not being reflected in the market just yet. Give it time.SEANA SMITH: So Jeff, what could then be reflected when we talk about the chance of a possible correction? What does that correction look like?JEFF BIERMAN: I don't think it's going to be that serious of a correction, like, you know, just a demonizing thing. However, let me put this in perspective, Seana. This is the greatest bifurcation that I've ever seen in 35 years between value stocks and growth stocks. Portfolio managers are treating growth stocks literally like they're the ugly redheaded stepchild or cancer. They want to have nothing to do with it.As a matter of fact, the lower the growth the value stocks go, the higher the growth stocks go. The market is sending a message that we don't want value at any cost. We don't. We want growth at any cost.And if you were to ask me what the linchpin is that's going to get the market to turn on its heels and finally get that corrective mode, it's probably going to be somewhere between the mean reversion of the growth stocks coming down and value stocks coming back into favor. That's where I see the market start to do its kind of corrective mode.And I sent you a graphic that there are two sectors that carry the market this year. If you remove the-- there's 11 sectors in the S&amp;P. Technology, and consumer discretionary are responsible for the entire gain in the S&amp;P absent of those two sectors, the S&amp;P is actually down for the year.So at some point, the consumer discretionary sector, the XLY is going to have to make a move. And the XLY is made up of things, like I said, high end-- the Lululemons, the Nikes, the Abercrombie &amp; Fitches. Those things are going to have to correct at some point. And value at some point will come back into play.For some apparent reason, dividends have no interest to portfolio managers. I'm not sure why.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah.JEFF BIERMAN: But in a corrective mode, that would seem to place to park your money.AKIKO FUJITA: So Jeff, is all of that to say that you see opportunity in value right now and that's where maybe investors should be looking?JEFF BIERMAN: Oh, my goodness, do I see opportunity? I-- some of the-- I-- they've been shunning utilities all year long. Nobody wants to touch utility because interest rates have been rising. But the fact of the matter, AT&amp;T and Verizon actually offer tremendous yields. Their cash flow is steady. And if the market does go into a corrective phase, this could be a place to park your money to get a lot of upside as well as a very kind of juicy dividend.My other two areas is they've been shunning, except for Eli Lilly, Akiko-- all year long, all year, nobody wants to buy-- have anything to do with pharma. Pfizer, thrown, kicked to the curb. Bristol-Myers, kicked to the curb. Those are the places where the greatest value opportunities are because they're at single-digit PEs and yields that go from 3% to 6%.So I think that if the recession siren is sounded, you're going to find great value in pharma and in utilities. And that money will actually come out of the XLY and come out of the XLK because it's just been overcooked for too long.SEANA SMITH: So some opportunity in some of those recent beaten down plays. Jeff Bierman, always great to get your perspective. Thanks. Have a good weekend.JEFF BIERMAN: Thank you, Seana. Have a nice day.]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Ross Stores is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while TJX has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ROST is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ROST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.28, while TJX has a forward P/E of 24.81. We also note that ROST has a PEG ratio of 2.01. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TJX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.23.Another notable valuation metric for ROST is its P/B ratio of 9.31. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TJX has a P/B of 16.01.Based on these metrics and many more, ROST holds a Value grade of B, while TJX has a Value grade of C.Story continuesROST has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TJX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ROST is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd. or Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd.), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the potential outcome of any litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, prospective performance and outlook of Horizon’s business, performance and opportunities and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not obtain regulatory clearance to acquire Horizon or be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.Horizon Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

NRG continues to expand through organic and inorganic initiatives. The company’s diverse customer base and long-term customer retention strategy will further boost its performance. Its dividend policy and share repurchase program will further increase shareholders’ value.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face risks related to disruptions in its fuel delivery system.TailwindsIn March 2023, NRG completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home. During second-quarter 2023, it began the integration of Vivint Smart Home, which resulted in solid performance. Owing to such performance, the company has doubled its growth synergy target of $60 million for 2023.NRG Energy has made a significant progress in its transformation to an integrated power company through its focus on customers. Courtesy of its high-quality services, the company has been able to retain customers. NRG does not depend on a single customer to generate revenues, which adds stability and predictability to customer bills and its earnings.The company has been trying to slowly lower the proportion of debt in the capital mix for a while. It expects a total of $2.55 billion of debt reduction and has already completed $200 million debt reduction to further strengthen its balance sheet.NRG is focusing on clean generation to lower emissions. On Sep 24, 2019, it announced greenhouse gas reduction goals. Under this plan, the company targets to achieve a 50% emission cut by 2025 and net-zero emissions by 2050 from the 2014 baseline.HeadwindsThe disruption in NRG Energy’s fuel supplies could adversely impact its result of operations, financial condition and cash flows. This is because the company relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel the majority of its power generation facilities.

111,0d77b896-4cf5-3060-83ad-358716e377d1,NEE,2023-09-02,2 Large-Cap Stocks Down 30% to Buy in September for Long-Term Gains,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-large-cap-stocks-down-211900911.html,1693603140,STORY,"['NEE', 'NKE', '^GSPC']","[Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into where the stock market stands as we start September. The bullish backdrop seems to remain in place at the moment as Wall Street bets on a soft landing and a huge return to earnings growth next year. Therefore, some investors might want to consider looking for proven large-cap stocks that haven’t bounced back yet.Despite a bit of a cooldown on the last day of the month, Wall Street could have hardly imagined a better end to what was shaping up to be a rough stretch for the market following the great start to 2023. The downturn was certainly healthy and needed. Investors weathered that storm and the bulls have seemingly retaken control of the market, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq back above their 50-day moving averages.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe wave of economic data this week highlighted why many are leaning toward a soft landing as the economy continues to slowly cool while remaining stable. The impressive outlook for earnings growth in 2024 and 2025, 11.8% and 11%, respectively, further bolsters the bullish case.Of course, there could always be more selling in the coming weeks. But long-term investors shouldn’t try too hard to time the market, with the last three and a half years serving as a useful illustration.The two stocks we explore today—Nike (NKE) and NextEra Energy (NEE)—are trading at least 30% below their records even though they remain titans of their respective industries.  Nike, Inc. (NKE) stock has tumbled as the sportswear powerhouse deals with rapidly changing consumer shopping patterns over the last several years, as well as higher costs and some increased competition in the running shoe market. Yet, Nike remains one of the biggest apparel and shoe companies in the world and one of the most valuable and recognizable brands on the planet. Nike has gone all-in on its own e-commerce and direct-to-consumer offerings to boost margins and adapt to the new retail era.Story continuesNike fell just short of our Q4 EPS estimate in late June. But its overall FY23 revenue still climbed 10%, and 16% on a currency neutral basis. Zacks estimates call for Nike’s revenue to jump 5% in FY24 and another 9% in FY25 to help boost its adjusted earnings by 15% and 18.5%, respectively. NKE lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment, but its most accurate/most recent EPS estimates came in solidly above consensus for this year and next.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNike shares are down around 40% from their highs and 30% below their average Zacks price target. NKE recently bounced out of oversold RSI territory, but it is still trading under some key short-term and long-term moving averages that might make some investors nervous to buy right now. But those who can handle more near-term downside risk might want to consider Nike as it trades around where it was before the initial Covid selloff in early 2020.  NextEra Energy (NEE) stock has fallen 20% in 2023 as part of a roughly 30% drop from its peaks. Similar to Nike, NEE is trading solidly beneath a handful of key moving averages and around where it was prior to the initial Covid market crash. The downturn also has NEE sitting at long-term RSI levels that it last hit back in 2009 and 2010. And NextEra trades at a 40% discount to own its 10-year highs at 20.4X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median.Even with the drop, NEE stock has climbed by 750% in the last 20 years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 355%. Plus, NextEra is one of roughly 65 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which are firms that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. And 10 of the 13 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for NEE are “Strong Buys.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the business side, NextEra runs one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., Florida Power &amp; Light Company, and it is one of the biggest producers of wind and solar energy on the planet. NextEra is a battery storage leader as well, and it is exposed to resurgent nuclear power. Overall, the $135 billion market cap firm provides a potent combination of stability via its utility segment and the long-term growth potential of renewable energy.(Disclosure: Ben Rains own NEE in Zacks Alternative Energy Innovators and in his personal portfolio) Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TSN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.48 per share on the 15th of December. This makes the dividend yield 3.7%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Tyson Foods Tyson Foods' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 697% of cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 36%, so there isn't too much pressure on the dividend.historic-dividendTyson Foods Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.92. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 25% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though Tyson Foods' EPS has declined at around 34% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Tyson Foods' DividendIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Tyson Foods' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Tyson Foods is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Guest checkout actually refers to the execution of transactions on e-commerce platforms without saving the card credentials of cardholders. ALT ID, a tailored capability developed by Mastercard’s security systems, generates an alternate identifier for each of the card numbers provided by cardholders on merchant websites. This, in turn, infuses more security into the guest checkout transactions and provides a greater peace of mind to both merchants and consumers. The ongoing digitization trend, that shows no mood of slowing down, offers innumerous benefits to merchants and consumers of the world.But the trend to go digital often invites sophisticated methods of cybercrimes, which compromise payments received by merchants and the confidential data of consumers. This, in turn, might lead to the incurrence of exorbitant costs.As the solution preserves the confidentiality of card numbers, more number of cardholders are likely to get encouraged to opt for online shopping and stay abreast with the digitization trend. Meanwhile, merchants and payment service providers will benefit from seamless integration of the ALT ID solution within their online platforms, an upgraded customers’ payment experience and improved payment success rates.Some of the Indian payment solution providers that have announced the adoption of the ALT ID solution include Juspay, PayU and Razorpay.Launching of such beneficial solutions may widen Mastercard's customer base in India as well as fetch greater revenues from the increased utilization of its solutions. The country seems to be an attractive market for the tech giant for infusing greater digitization, owing to the elevated Internet penetration, increased smartphone usage and several government initiatives to boost the nation’s digital growth. This August, Mastercard unveiled the Mastercard Strive India, which will leverage tie-ups with trade associations, non-profits, and government agencies to enable the country’s micro-enterprises, women-owned and led businesses and agri-entrepreneurs easily adopt digital means.Story continuesMA boasts a solid hold on the worldwide digital payments market and its robust digital arm built on partnerships and investments has played a pivotal role in achieving this position. The tech giant actively pursues tie-ups with payment service providers, merchants, acquirers and financial institutions to infuse frictionless payment experiences across different parts of the globe.Shares of Mastercard have gained 28% in a year compared with the industry’s 16% rise.

Shares have lost about 3.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Qualcomm due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Qualcomm Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues FalterQualcomm reported soft third-quarter fiscal 2023 results owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment, inflationary pressures and soft recovery in China, resulting in lower-than-expected demand and elevated inventory levels. While the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line missed the same despite the strength of the business model, revenue diversification and the ability to respond proactively to the evolving market scenario. Shares declined sharply post-earnings release owing to a relatively grim outlook due to limited market visibility and high channel inventory levels.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter declined to $1,803 million or $1.60 per share from $3,730 million or $3.29 per share in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line contraction.Quarterly non-GAAP net income came in at $2,105 million or $1.87 per share compared with $3,356 million or $2.96 per share in the year-ago quarter due to lower-than-expected revenues owing to soft demand trends. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents.RevenuesOn a GAAP basis, total revenues in the fiscal third quarter were $8,451 million compared with $10,936 million in the prior-year quarter. The quarterly revenues missed the consensus mark of $8,513 million. Despite solid automotive revenues, the top line decreased on soft demand patterns and elevated inventory levels owing to market uncertainty and macroeconomic woes. High inflationary pressures and soft economic recovery in China further compounded the problems. However, Qualcomm witnessed strong momentum in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial sectors, along with strength in Snapdragon portfolio within the automotive sector. Non-GAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $8,442 million compared with $10,928 million in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesSegment ResultsQuarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) declined 24% year over year to $7,174 million, as strength in the automotive platform was more than offset by lower demand in handsets and channel inventory drawdown within the IoT business. The segment’s revenues fell short of our revenue estimates of $7,263.2 million. Despite solid potential in the EDGE networking business that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets, the company witnessed lower demand owing to an uncertain landscape.Automotive revenues rose 13% to $434 million, while handset and IoT revenues were down 25% and 24%, respectively, to $5,255 million and $1,480 million. This was the 11th consecutive quarter in which Qualcomm recorded double-digit growth in automotive revenues. EBT margin for the QCT segment decreased to 24% from 32%.Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1,230 million, down 19% year over year due to lower licensing revenues. The segment’s revenues exceeded our estimates of $1,210.6 million. EBT margin declined to 66% from 71%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityQualcomm generated $2,657 million of net cash from operating activities in the fiscal third quarter compared with $2,895 million a year ago, bringing the respective tallies for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 to $7,209 million and $7,650 million. At quarter-end, the company had $6,087 million in cash and cash equivalents and $14,530 million of long-term debt. The company repurchased 4 million shares for $400 million during the quarter.Q4 GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues of $8.1-$8.9 billion due to rapid deterioration in demand and high channel inventory. Management expects the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, high inflation and a slower recovery in China to adversely impact demand as customers remain cautious with their purchasing decisions, further leading to inflated inventory levels. Non-GAAP earnings are projected to be $1.80-$2.00 per share, while GAAP earnings are likely to be $1.37-$1.57 per share. Revenues from QTL are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.35 billion. For QCT, the company anticipates revenues between $6.9 billion and $7.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Qualcomm has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerQualcomm belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry. Another stock from the same industry, Nokia (NOK), has gained 2.6% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2023.Nokia reported revenues of $6.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. EPS of $0.08 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.For the current quarter, Nokia is expected to post earnings of $0.09 per share, indicating a change of -10% from the year-ago quarter.

127,8dadaaec-9411-3c7e-b891-80ec28d59efd,EXPE,2023-09-02,NYC Airbnb Registration Backlog Piles Up Ahead of New Rules,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nyc-airbnb-registration-backlog-piles-194027558.html,1693597227,STORY,"['ABNB', 'EXPE']","[(Bloomberg) -- As of Tuesday, it’s gotten much harder to find an Airbnb rental in New York City.Most Read from BloombergTrudeau Is Stuck in India With Faulty Aircraft After Hearing Criticism From ModiThe Mighty American Consumer Is About to Hit a Wall, Investors SayTesla and China Risk Leaving Volkswagen on a Road to NowhereTech Giants Power Stock Gains as Tesla Jumps 10%: Markets WrapMorgan Stanley Sees Dojo Boosting Tesla’s Value by $500 BillionThat’s because of new rules that took effect requiring hosts to obtain a license from the city verifying compliance with strict occupancy regulations and building codes. According to some property owners across the city, the Office of Special Enforcement was struggling to keep up with a backlog of these license applications ahead of the enforcement deadline.“The biggest frustration is just how hard it is to reach any humans at the office there,” said Ilan Rabinovitch, an Airbnb host of two years who has applied to register two rooms in his Upper West Side brownstone. He said he’s contacted the OSE at least four times inquiring about updates regarding his registration, asking for average turnaround times or staffing levels, but he’s either gotten no response or a vague reply from OSE Deputy Executive Director Francine Vlantes O’Keeffe.At stake is potentially millions of dollars in lost revenue for Airbnb in one of its biggest markets. Some 7,500 units didn’t meet the requirements to apply for a license, according to market analytics firm AirDNA. More than half of those listings are frequently rented and account for about 40% of Airbnb’s income in New York City, according to AirDNA. In a lawsuit against the city over the rules, Airbnb said it earned $85 million in net revenue in 2022 in the Big Apple.Why Renting an Airbnb in NYC Just Got a Lot Harder: QuickTakeNew York has been sparring with Airbnb for years over rules that prohibit rentals in most apartments for fewer than 30 days without a tenant present. AirDNA estimates that only 9,500 of Airbnb’s 23,000 listings are legally eligible to apply for a license. Another 6,000 units, mostly hotels and serviced apartments that fall under another classification, are exempt from registering.Story continuesThe city has said the registration law is necessary to crack down on unlawful rental operations by bad actors that subject guests to hazardous living conditions, force up rents and destroy the fabric of neighborhoods. But many hosts have sided with Airbnb in opposing the new rules, saying they rely on the extra income to be able to cover housing costs in one of the country’s most expensive real estate markets.While the city works through its backlog of applications, some NYC hosts have been waiting for weeks, if not months, to hear about their status. Failure to register will lead to fines and the listing will be blocked on platforms like Airbnb and Expedia Group Inc.’s Vrbo.The city had so far approved only 257 short-term rental host registrations out of 3,250 applications, New York’s Office of Special Enforcement told travel publication Skift on Aug. 28. It denied 72 applications and returned 479 to request additional information, according to Skift. Thousands more hosts have yet to apply.The late-summer deluge of applications — more than half were filed only earlier this month after a judge dismissed the lawsuit — is weighing on the OSE, which was operating with 28 people, or less than half of its budgeted positions as of mid-May, Gothamist reported.The OSE and its overseeing body, the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, didn’t respond to emailed questions from Bloomberg News about enforcement capacity and the progress of application reviews. In her emailed response to Rabinovitch, which was seen by Bloomberg News, O’Keeffe said the office “reviews applications in order of submissions, and review times vary.”Those operating short-term rentals illegally face fines of as much as $5,000, or three times the revenue generated by the unit. Airbnb and other rental platforms also face penalties if listings slip through. As a result, Airbnb is blocking the listing calendars of hosts who don’t provide a registration number by the deadline and haven’t updated their minimum night stay to 30 nights or more. A spokeswoman for Expedia declined to comment on the regulation. The company doesn’t break out metrics on its Vrbo unit, but AirDNA said Vrbo hosts 10% of short-term listings in New York or around 2,680, and doesn’t allow shared rooms on its site.When asked for comment, Airbnb reiterated an argument it made in its lawsuit that the regulations will deprive the city of significant tourist dollars as they will take away a critical supply of alternative lodging that helps meet demand that hotels can’t during seasonal events like the NYC marathon and major holidays. While no city made up more than 1.3% of the company’s 2022 revenue, New York is among the top five Airbnb markets with the most active listings behind Orlando, Los Angeles and Phoenix.“The city is sending a clear message to millions of potential visitors who will now have fewer accommodation options when they visit New York City: you are not welcome,” said Theo Yedinsky, Airbnb’s global policy director.New York is far from alone in battling with Airbnb over listings and plenty of other cities have long tried to impose stricter regulations, with varying results. Meanwhile, San Francisco-based Airbnb recently reported reported total active listings jumped 19% in the second quarter from a year earlier to more than 7 million, adding more net active listings than in any quarter in its history. Its shares are up more than 50% this year — and gained on Tuesday after the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said it would add the stock to the S&amp;P 500 Index.Read More: Why Cities Can’t Crack Down on AirbnbsBut even if short-term stays still make up the bulk of listings on Airbnb, the company is seeing an increase in longer-term stays as some hosts are giving up fighting against restrictions like those in New York. Bookings for 28 days or more accounted for about 18% of total gross bookings in the second quarter. More hosts, concerned about the risk of penalties or legal costs, are focusing on month-to-month rentals, which can be less profitable but aren’t as widely regulated.Rabinovitch said he was conflicted about the information he had gotten from authorities about whether to keep his listing up if he didn’t receive approval by Tuesday. He has also sought information from his city council member, whose office said they didn’t know the answer to his questions, and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, whose office told him to stop renting until he gets approval, Rabinovitch said. The office of the city’s public advocate told him it won’t be proactively issuing fines unless there is an egregious violation. In an email to Rabinovitch, the office said that while there are a large number of applications pending, “people have been making significant efforts to register may be given leniency.”“We urge the Office of Special Enforcement to focus on large-scale bad actors depleting our city’s housing stock, rather than New Yorkers operating in good faith to try and make ends meet amid the ongoing affordability crisis,” a spokesman for the public advocate told Bloomberg News.Rabinovitch said he’s confident he’ll ultimately receive approval from the city. He doesn’t want to risk fines but also needs the income to pay off expensive property taxes, he said.“I have guests booked through the rest of the year,” he said. “They’re reaching out to me and asked me what to do. I’m like, I don’t know, I’ll let you know if I ever get approved.”(Updates to clarify units that are legal but ineligible to apply for license in fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGoogle’s Ties With Apple Under Spotlight in Antitrust TrialHuawei’s Surprise Phone Gives Ammo to Biden Doubters on ChinaLyme Disease Has Exploded, and a New Vaccine Is (Almost) Here©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to skip our in-depth analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Companies to Work for in 2023.As we step into 2023, the adage ""people are a company's greatest asset"" has never rung truer. The competitive edge now hinges on more than just profit margins and market share; it rests firmly on a company's ability to foster an environment where innovation thrives, where diversity is celebrated, and where employees find not just a job, but a genuine sense of purpose. Let’s explore what are the current trends driving employment around the world.Employment Trends in 2023 and the Key Players Remote and hybrid work have become undeniable trends that are reshaping the modern workforce. In 2023, 12.7% of full-time employees already work remotely, and 28.2% have embraced a hybrid work model that indicates the rapid evolution of work environments. Looking ahead, it's predicted that by 2025, about 32.6 million Americans, equivalent to 22% of the workforce, will be working remotely. These trends are driven by strong employee preferences as 98% of workers express a desire to work remotely at least some of the time, all thanks to the flexibility, autonomy, and improved work-life balance that remote work offers. Moreover, 93% of employers plan to continue conducting job interviews remotely. Remote and hybrid work have become integral to the modern work landscape, and their growth is expected to continue as both employees and employers recognize the benefits of these models. Speaking of remote work, do check out our article on best work from home jobs for 2023. It is also worth noting that remote work equally benefits employers by reducing overhead costs associated with office space and utilities and hence, increasing access to a global talent pool, and boost employee productivity and job satisfaction. It can lead to lower employee turnover rates and the ability to tap into specialized skills from anywhere, ultimately resulting in cost savings and a more diverse, efficient, and agile workforce.Story continuesAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s Chief People Officer, Gloria Chen recently mentioned: ""While we believe in the value of in-person interactions, we know that in some cases, a remote work arrangement makes sense for Adobe. We expect to double the size of our remote worker population over time as we learn and iterate on making this model successful.""Moreover, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s employees were also the happiest employees as they felt most satisfied with their pay, according to Comparably’s sixth annual report based on employee reviews. Another employment trend for 2023 is that organizations will drive DEI forward with growing pushback. To achieve the DEI goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has established 12 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which serve as platforms for employees to connect, engage, and unleash their potential. These ERGs also play a pivotal role in cultivating relationship capital and cultivating an inclusive environment and culture within the company.In terms of specific diversity goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has set ambitious targets. By 2025, the company aims to have 50% women in management positions worldwide that highlight its commitment to gender diversity. Additionally, in the United States, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is striving for 35% racial diversity in management roles. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s dedication to diversity and inclusion has also garnered recognition and accolades from various quarters.

The pharmaceutical industry says the program will curtail profits and compel it to pull back on developing new treatments.Six other drugmakers, including Bristol Myers Squibb, J&amp;J and Merck, had already sued the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Medicare, before the drug list was announced in an effort to derail the price-setting process.Novartis said in a written statement that the negotiations were unconstitutional because they amounted to a taking of private property and imposed excessive fines on manufacturers that refused to participate in the talks or accept the prices Medicare reached.The other drugmakers made similar arguments in their lawsuits.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Medtronic, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.072 = US$5.9b ÷ (US$91b - US$9.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Therefore, Medtronic has an ROCE of 7.2%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.7%. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Medtronic compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Medtronic's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Medtronic's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Medtronic to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 50% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Medtronic's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to Medtronic's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.If you want to continue researching Medtronic, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Medtronic isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The top line also decreased from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $2.49 billion.Key TakeawaysAdjusted EBITDA was $1.61 billion in the quarter under review, up 7.3% from the prior-year quarter’s level. The figure also beat our estimate of $1.53 billion.

The figure also beat our estimate of $303.3 million. The improvement resulted from contributions from Trace Midstream and the benefits of realized gains on natural gas hedges.Northeast G&amp;P: Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was $515 million, up 14.4% from the prior-year quarter’s $450 million. The figure also beat our estimate of $442.5 million. This uptick in performance can be attributed to higher volumes at Ohio Valley Midstream, Marcellus South and Cardinal.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of 16 million against a profit of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. This was due to low commodity margins. The reported figure missed our predicted profit of $51.9 million.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetTotal costs and expenses were $1.61 billion in the reported quarter.Total capital expenditure was $715 million compared with $429 million a year ago.

Shares have lost about 4.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Spirit Aerosystems due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Spirit AeroSystems Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues Rise Y/Y.Spirit AeroSystems reported a second-quarter 2023 adjusted loss of $1.46 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 79 cents. The figure also deteriorated from the year-ago quarter’s reported loss of $1.21 cents per share.Barring one-time adjustments, Spirit AeroSystems recorded a GAAP loss of $1.96 per share compared with a loss of $1.17 in the prior-year period.Highlights of the ReleaseTotal revenues of $1,365 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,270 million by 7.4%. Moreover, the top line rose 8% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher production deliveries of the Boeing 737 and 787 jets and increased Defense and Space revenues.The company’s backlog at the end of the second quarter totaled $40.5 billion, up from the prior quarter’s level of $37 billion.Segmental PerformanceCommercial Segment: Revenues in the segment increased 5% year over year to $1,083 million. The upside can be attributed to increased production revenues from the Boeing 737 and 787 jet programs.Operating loss widened to $72.9 million from $45.1 million in the year-ago period.Defense &amp; Space: The segment recorded revenues of $189.6 million, up 29.5% year over year, driven by increased activity on development programs and higher production from the Boeing P-8 program.Operating income decreased 12.4% to $12 million from $13.7 million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesAftermarket: The top line improved 14.6% year over year to $92.1 million, driven by higher spare part sales as well as increased maintenance, repair and overhaul activity.Operating profit increased 105.9% year over year to $24.3 million.Operational HighlightsTotal operating costs and expenses rose 9% year over year to $1,485.1 million due to higher cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and restructuring costs.SPR’s operating loss totaled $120.4 million compared with $104.7 million in the prior-year period. This increase was mainly on account of higher changes in estimates as well as contra revenue recorded for a potential customer claim.Financial PositionAs of Jun 29, 2023, Spirit AeroSystems had $525.7 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $658.6 million as of Dec 31, 2022.The long-term debt as of Jun 29, 2023, totaled $3,814.9 million, which came in line with the figure recorded at the end of 2022.Cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $229 million during the first six months of 2023 compared with $331.7 million a year ago.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Since the earnings release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -781.16% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Spirit Aerosystems has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Spirit Aerosystems has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One such stock that merits attention is Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN). The stock, which is currently priced at $170.06, recorded a gain of 2.93% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 14.61%. The stock's fair valuation is $337.17, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ILMN. Click here to check it out. ILMN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ILMNThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAssessing Potential Risks in Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN)However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Illumina should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score, Altman Z-score, and Beneish M-score. These indicators suggest that Illumina, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesA Closer Look at Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN)Illumina provides tools and services to analyze genetic material with life science and clinical lab applications. The company generates over 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications.Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapConclusion: Is Illumina a Value Trap?Considering the company's low Piotroski F-score, Altman Z-score, and Beneish M-score, it's evident that Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) might be a potential value trap. Despite its apparent undervaluation, the identified risk factors cannot be ignored. Therefore, investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions. It's crucial to remember that while a stock may seem undervalued, it could also be a value trap.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 64% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Southern. See our latest analysis for Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Southern?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Southern already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Southern's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Southern. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. With 7.2% and 5.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SouthernThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Southern Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$171m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 35% stake in Southern. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Southern  you should be aware of, and 2 of them shouldn't be ignored.Ultimately the future is most important.

(NYSE:TEL) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.59 on the 1st of December, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield 1.8%, which is above the industry average. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. However, TE Connectivity's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 35.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.84, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.36. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. TE Connectivity has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 14% per annum. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

Nike sells products worldwide through company-owned stores, franchised stores, and third-party retailers. The firm also operates e-commerce platforms in more than 40 countries. Nearly all its production is outsourced to contract manufacturers in more than 30 countries. Nike was founded in 1964 and is based in Beaverton, Oregon.Unveiling Nike Inc's Dividend Performance: A Deep Dive into its Growth, Yield, and SustainabilityA Glimpse at Nike Inc's Dividend HistoryNike Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1986. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Nike Inc has increased its dividend each year since 1997. The stock is thus listed as a dividend aristocrat, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 26 years.Unveiling Nike Inc's Dividend Performance: A Deep Dive into its Growth, Yield, and SustainabilityBreaking Down Nike Inc's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, Nike Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.29% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.33%. This suggests an expectation of increase dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Nike Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 11.50%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 11.30% per year. And over the past decade, Nike Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 12.40%.Story continuesUnveiling Nike Inc's Dividend Performance: A Deep Dive into its Growth, Yield, and SustainabilityThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-05-31, Nike Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.41. Nike Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Nike Inc's profitability 10 out of 10 as of 2023-05-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Nike Inc's growth rank of 10 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Nike Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Nike Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 11.60% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 75.27% of global competitors. The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Nike Inc's earnings increased by approximately 26.40% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 66.88% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 22.50%, which outperforms than approximately 75.16% of global competitors.Next StepsGiven Nike Inc's consistent dividend payments, impressive growth rate, reasonable payout ratio, high profitability, and strong growth metrics, it appears to be a promising investment for dividend investors. However, investors should continue to monitor these factors over time to ensure the company's ability to maintain its dividend performance.

The bullish backdrop seems to remain in place at the moment as Wall Street bets on a soft landing and a huge return to earnings growth next year. Therefore, some investors might want to consider looking for proven large-cap stocks that haven’t bounced back yet.Despite a bit of a cooldown on the last day of the month, Wall Street could have hardly imagined a better end to what was shaping up to be a rough stretch for the market following the great start to 2023. The downturn was certainly healthy and needed. Investors weathered that storm and the bulls have seemingly retaken control of the market, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq back above their 50-day moving averages.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe wave of economic data this week highlighted why many are leaning toward a soft landing as the economy continues to slowly cool while remaining stable. The impressive outlook for earnings growth in 2024 and 2025, 11.8% and 11%, respectively, further bolsters the bullish case.Of course, there could always be more selling in the coming weeks. But long-term investors shouldn’t try too hard to time the market, with the last three and a half years serving as a useful illustration.The two stocks we explore today—Nike (NKE) and NextEra Energy (NEE)—are trading at least 30% below their records even though they remain titans of their respective industries.  Nike, Inc. (NKE) stock has tumbled as the sportswear powerhouse deals with rapidly changing consumer shopping patterns over the last several years, as well as higher costs and some increased competition in the running shoe market. Yet, Nike remains one of the biggest apparel and shoe companies in the world and one of the most valuable and recognizable brands on the planet. Nike has gone all-in on its own e-commerce and direct-to-consumer offerings to boost margins and adapt to the new retail era.Story continuesNike fell just short of our Q4 EPS estimate in late June. But its overall FY23 revenue still climbed 10%, and 16% on a currency neutral basis. Zacks estimates call for Nike’s revenue to jump 5% in FY24 and another 9% in FY25 to help boost its adjusted earnings by 15% and 18.5%, respectively. NKE lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment, but its most accurate/most recent EPS estimates came in solidly above consensus for this year and next.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNike shares are down around 40% from their highs and 30% below their average Zacks price target. NKE recently bounced out of oversold RSI territory, but it is still trading under some key short-term and long-term moving averages that might make some investors nervous to buy right now. But those who can handle more near-term downside risk might want to consider Nike as it trades around where it was before the initial Covid selloff in early 2020.  NextEra Energy (NEE) stock has fallen 20% in 2023 as part of a roughly 30% drop from its peaks. Similar to Nike, NEE is trading solidly beneath a handful of key moving averages and around where it was prior to the initial Covid market crash. The downturn also has NEE sitting at long-term RSI levels that it last hit back in 2009 and 2010. And NextEra trades at a 40% discount to own its 10-year highs at 20.4X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median.Even with the drop, NEE stock has climbed by 750% in the last 20 years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 355%. Plus, NextEra is one of roughly 65 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which are firms that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. And 10 of the 13 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for NEE are “Strong Buys.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the business side, NextEra runs one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., Florida Power &amp; Light Company, and it is one of the biggest producers of wind and solar energy on the planet. NextEra is a battery storage leader as well, and it is exposed to resurgent nuclear power. Overall, the $135 billion market cap firm provides a potent combination of stability via its utility segment and the long-term growth potential of renewable energy.(Disclosure: Ben Rains own NEE in Zacks Alternative Energy Innovators and in his personal portfolio) Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fueled by international growth, the Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) rival boosted its full year guidance.Fiscal Second Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on July 30th, athletic apparel retailer reported its sales rose 18% YoY to $2.21 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $2.17 billion. Despite a slow down in North America where sales grew 11%, total sales were fueled by strong international growth, as markets outside North America expanded 52% while China alone increased 61%, more than doubling from last year comparable quarter’s 30%. Net income also rose at revenue’s 18% YoY pace to $341.6 million, or $2.68 per share, topping Refinitiv’s estimate of $2.54.Both men’s category and DTC sales rose 15% as Lululemon is pushing these segments intensively as part of its growth strategy. In the reported quarter, DTC sales made 40% of the total revenue. Inventories rose 14% to $1.7 billion but the gross margin was in line with StreetAccount’s expectations at 58.8% as it got a boost from lowered freight costs.A Lifted OutlookFor the undergoing quarter, Lululemon expects EPS in the range between $2.23 and $2.28 and revenue in the range between $2.17 billion to $2.19 billion, which are in line with Refinitiv’s expectations.The yoga ants and sporty purses retailer is expecting full year fiscal year sales in the range between $9.51 billion to $9.57 billion, lifting its prior guidance range between $9.44 billion to $9.51 billion. Annual profit outlook is between $12.02 and $12.17 per share, also up from the prior forecast range between $11.74 and $11.94.Lululemon’s quarterly report showed healthy and strong growth with incredible performance in China as the yoga pants and sports retailer continues pursuing its ambitious “Power of Three x2” strategy that implies doubling sales from 2021’s revenue of $6.25 billion to $12.5 billion by 2026. To achieve this goal, Lululemon is expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint, its DTC revenue like Nike and strengthening its positioning in the men’s department. Also taking a page from the Nike playbook, Lululemon recently got into footwear and is reportedly making steady progress. CEO Calvin McDonald said that although product innovation is essential to the company’s growth plan, brand awareness is also a priority that is being addressed by the ‘’Get Into It'’ campaign. Nike did it with ‘Just do It’ despite immense competition in the sports apparel segment, and it did a great job at reducing its dependence on wholesale, and until recently, it was in a league of its own. Although Lululemon does not have that level of brand strength and it just entered the footwear business, it 'got into it' and grew into a worthy opponent to Nike, with its latest reports showing it is well underway to challenge its dominance in the apparel business.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

157,d71e3503-3e59-3cb5-81fd-9ec27673c38b,VFC,2023-09-02,Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value Trap,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vf-vfc-too-good-true-233314638.html,1693611194,STORY,['VFC'],"[Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is VF Corp (NYSE:VFC). The stock, which is currently priced at 20.46, recorded a gain of 3.54% in a day and a 3-month increase of 22.08%. The stock's fair valuation is $61.86, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with VF should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 2, Altman Z-score of 1.39, and These indicators suggest that VF, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. VF's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Story continuesBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Overview: VF Corp (NYSE:VFC)VF designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its apparel categories are active, outdoor, and work. Its portfolio of about a dozen brands includes Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalysis of VF's ProfitabilityLet's delve deeper into VF's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2021: 7.66; 2022: 7.45; 2023: 0.84, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in VF.Observing the financials of VF, it's important to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-133.9 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $117.12 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendAssessing the aspect of leverage, liquidity, and sources of funds, VF demonstrates an alarming rise in its debt-to-total assets ratio over the past three years. The provided data shows 2021: 0.51; 2022: 0.48; 2023: 0.56, expressed as percentages. A higher debt ratio suggests that VF is increasingly financing its assets through debt, thereby escalating its financial risk. The Piotroski F-Score views this as a negative indicator, further cautioning investors about VF.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapExamining VF's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2021: 1.49; 2022: 1.33; 2023: 1.37, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that VF's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, VF follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 53.47; 2022: 54.04; 2023: 52.28 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that VF is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.In terms of operational efficiency, another key indicator, VF has unfortunately reported a declining trend in asset turnover over the past three years, as evidenced by the data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 (expressed in percentages). Asset turnover measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales, and a decrease in this ratio can indicate a drop in efficiency. This could be due to various factors, such as underutilization of assets or a decline in the market demand for the company's products or services. Consequently, this downward trend in asset turnover implies that VF may need to revisit its operational strategies to improve the utilization of its assets and boost its sales volume.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for VF, its current score suggests potential troubles. The company's low Piotroski F-score, coupled with its declining ROA, increasing debt ratio, and decreasing current ratio, paints a concerning picture. Furthermore, its declining gross margin percentage and asset turnover ratio suggest issues with profitability and operational efficiency.

If you want to skip our in-depth analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Companies to Work for in 2023.As we step into 2023, the adage ""people are a company's greatest asset"" has never rung truer. The competitive edge now hinges on more than just profit margins and market share; it rests firmly on a company's ability to foster an environment where innovation thrives, where diversity is celebrated, and where employees find not just a job, but a genuine sense of purpose. Let’s explore what are the current trends driving employment around the world.Employment Trends in 2023 and the Key Players Remote and hybrid work have become undeniable trends that are reshaping the modern workforce. In 2023, 12.7% of full-time employees already work remotely, and 28.2% have embraced a hybrid work model that indicates the rapid evolution of work environments. Looking ahead, it's predicted that by 2025, about 32.6 million Americans, equivalent to 22% of the workforce, will be working remotely. These trends are driven by strong employee preferences as 98% of workers express a desire to work remotely at least some of the time, all thanks to the flexibility, autonomy, and improved work-life balance that remote work offers. Moreover, 93% of employers plan to continue conducting job interviews remotely. Remote and hybrid work have become integral to the modern work landscape, and their growth is expected to continue as both employees and employers recognize the benefits of these models. Speaking of remote work, do check out our article on best work from home jobs for 2023. It is also worth noting that remote work equally benefits employers by reducing overhead costs associated with office space and utilities and hence, increasing access to a global talent pool, and boost employee productivity and job satisfaction. It can lead to lower employee turnover rates and the ability to tap into specialized skills from anywhere, ultimately resulting in cost savings and a more diverse, efficient, and agile workforce.Story continuesAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s Chief People Officer, Gloria Chen recently mentioned: ""While we believe in the value of in-person interactions, we know that in some cases, a remote work arrangement makes sense for Adobe. We expect to double the size of our remote worker population over time as we learn and iterate on making this model successful.""Moreover, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s employees were also the happiest employees as they felt most satisfied with their pay, according to Comparably’s sixth annual report based on employee reviews. Another employment trend for 2023 is that organizations will drive DEI forward with growing pushback. To achieve the DEI goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has established 12 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which serve as platforms for employees to connect, engage, and unleash their potential. These ERGs also play a pivotal role in cultivating relationship capital and cultivating an inclusive environment and culture within the company.In terms of specific diversity goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has set ambitious targets. By 2025, the company aims to have 50% women in management positions worldwide that highlight its commitment to gender diversity. Additionally, in the United States, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is striving for 35% racial diversity in management roles. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s dedication to diversity and inclusion has also garnered recognition and accolades from various quarters. For example, it has been acknowledged by U.S. Veterans Magazine as the ""Best of the Best"" for its strides in advancing diversity efforts. Additionally, the company stands out as one of only two organizations that have consistently been included in the Working Mother 100 Best list for the past 28 years.20 Best Companies to Work for in 2023wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have looked at different surveys and indexes employed for the best companies to work for including Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For, Glassdoor’s best places to work 2023, and Reddit.

Shares have added about 6.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Seattle Genetics due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Seagen’s Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues Beat ExpectationsSeagen Inc. reported a loss of $1.13 per share in the second quarter of 2023, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 78 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 73 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues in the reported quarter were $604 million, increasing 21.3% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $556 million. Net product revenues in the second quarter were $544 million, up 25.9% year over year, driven by the strong uptake of Seagen’s portfolio of marketed cancer drugs.Quarter in DetailSeagen’s top line mainly comprises product, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. The company currently markets four drugs, Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and the newly approved Tivdak.Adcetris generated net sales of $262 million in the United States and Canada, up 30% year over year. The drug, which is the major contributor to SGEN’s revenues, is being evaluated in several label expansion studies. The reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $246 million.Padcev sales in the reported quarter totaled $161 million. Sales of the drug rose 30% on a year-over-year basis. Padcev sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $143 million.Tukysa’s second-quarter net sales were $99 million, up 11% on a year-over-year basis.The newly launched Tivdak generated sales worth $22 million in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 26%. Seagen commercializes Tivdak in collaboration with Zai Lab Limited.Story continuesIn September 2022, Seagen entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of Tivdak in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. ZLAB obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Tivdak in the given territory.Collaboration and license agreement revenues were $9 million in the second quarter, marking a significant decrease (68%) over the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to milestone payments received in the year-ago quarter, accompanied by decreased revenues from drug products supplied to collaborators.Royalty revenues of $51 million rose by 31% from the year-ago quarter’s $39 million. Seagen records royalty revenues on the sales of Adcetris from Takeda Pharmaceutical in the ex-U.S. markets as well as from Polivy’s sales under its collaboration with Roche.Polivy is an antibody-drug conjugate that uses Seagen’s technology and commercialized by Roche.Research and development expenses of $400 million increased 31.6% year over year, primarily driven by continued investment in the development of approved drugs and pipeline programs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.9% year over year to $244 million, mainly on account of higher costs related to the recent commercialization activities as well as costs incurred on other corporate activities, including $30 million in expenses associated with the pending acquisition by pharma goliath, Pfizer.Seagen entered into a definitive agreement in March 2023 to be acquired by Pfizer for $229 per share, bringing the valuation of the company to a whopping $43 billion. The acquisition, if followed through, will add Seagen’s portfolio of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and technology to Pfizer’s already robust portfolio of oncology drugs. The company will gain access to Pfizer’s resources to continue the development of its ADC technology. Pfizer should be able to bring new innovative cancer treatment options to patients by combining Seagen’s prowess in ADCs with Pfizer’s existing portfolio across both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, bolstering its position in the market and driving growth.Cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $1.3 billion for Seagen at the end of the second quarter of 2023 compared with $1.5 billion as of Mar 31, 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.71% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Seattle Genetics has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Seattle Genetics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSeattle Genetics belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. Another stock from the same industry, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), has gained 4.2% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2023.BioMarin reported revenues of $595.28 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.5%.

The European Commission approved Merck’s MRK blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda for the first-line treatment of certain types of patients with gastric cancer. AbbVie ABBV filed applications in the United States and Europe seeking approval of its medicine, Skyrizi for a new indication, ulcerative colitis.The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended marketing authorization for Pfizer PFE and partner BioNTech’s Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Roche RHHBY announced positive data from a phase III study evaluating its cancer drug Alecensa for people with ALK-positive early-stage lung cancer.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&amp;J’s Updates 2023 Guidance After Final Kenvue Separation: J&amp;J updated its financial guidance for 2023 after the final separation of its consumer health division, Kenvue. With the complete separation of the Consumer Health segment, J&amp;J has become a two-sector company focused on the Pharmaceutical and MedTech fields. Kenvue will now operate as a separate and fully independent company.This month, J&amp;J made an exchange offer for shares of Kenvue that it owned to complete the separation. After completion of the exchange offer, J&amp;J now has a 9.5% stake (approximately 180 million shares) in Kenvue’s common stock, which it may monetize in a tax-efficient manner in 2024.J&amp;J now expects revenues in the range of $83.2 billion-$84.0 billion compared with the earlier expectation of $98.8 billion to $99.8 billion. This new guidance excludes any revenues from the Consumer Health segment and now reflects sales from only the Pharmaceutical and MedTech units. Revenue growth is now expected in the range of 7%-8% versus the prior expectation of 6.5%-7.5%. The adjusted earnings per share guidance was lowered from a range of $10.70 -$10.80 to $10.00-$10.10. However, the earnings range implies growth in the range of 12%-13%, which is higher than the prior expectation of 5.5%-6.5%.Story continuesJ&amp;J submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA seeking full approval of Balversa for treating metastatic or unresectable urothelial carcinoma (UC). Balversa was approved by the FDA under the accelerated pathway in 2019 for FGFR-altered metastatic urothelial cancer. The latest sNDA is based on data from a cohort of the phase III THOR study, which was to be used as a confirmatory study to support continued approval of the drug in the UC indication. Data from this cohort of the THOR study showed that Balversa reduced the risk of death in patients by 36% versus chemotherapy.J&amp;J also filed a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) to the FDA seeking approval of its drug Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The sBLA is based on data from the phase III PAPILLON study. The FDA had granted accelerated approval to Rybrevant in 2021 for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. PAPILLON is also a confirmatory study for this accelerated approval.AbbVie Files Applications With FDA and EMA for Skyrizi for Ulcerative Colitis: AbbVie submitted regulatory applications to the FDA and EMA seeking approval of its drug Skyrizi (risankizumab) for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi is presently approved in the United States and Europe for Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. The regulatory applications filed to the FDA and the EMA were based on data from two phase III studies, an induction study, INSPIRE, and a maintenance study, COMMAND. Data from these studies showed that Skyrizi, as an induction and maintenance treatment, achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo Score) and key secondary endpointsEU Approval for Merck’s Keytruda in First-Line Gastric Cancer: The European Commission approved the expanded use of Keytruda plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1) in the European Union. The EU approval was based on positive progression-free data from the phase III KEYNOTE-811 study. Keytruda is already approved for similar use in the United States.CHMP Nod for Pfizer/BioNTech’s Updated COVID Jab: The CHMP has given a positive opinion, recommending approval for Pfizer/BioNTech’s Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech expect a final decision from the European Commission soon. The companies are preparing to roll out the updated vaccine to applicable EU member states immediately after a decision from the EMA. The companies have commercially manufactured the updated COVID-19 vaccine (at risk) to ensure supply readiness for the upcoming fall and winter seasons when demand is likely to increase.Roche’s Early-Stage Lung Cancer Study on Alecensa Meets Goal:  Roche’s cancer drug Alecensa reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death as adjuvant therapy for patients with early-stage ALK-positive NSCLC in the phase ALINA study. The ALINA study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival compared with platinum-based chemotherapy at a prespecified interim analysis. However, at the time of this analysis, overall survival data were immature.Alecensa is presently approved for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

Spectrum is the second largest U.S. cable provider, serving 14.7 million homes across large markets such as New York and Los Angeles.The dispute soured investor sentiment on the sector, which has also been grappling with the Hollywood writers and actors strike over wages and other issues which have raised doubts about whether companies will have enough content in coming months.Shares of Disney dropped 2.65% to a three-year low while Charter lost 3.4%. Warner Brothers Discovery Inc fell 10%, Fox Corp shed 6%, Paramount Global dropped 8%, while Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, was down nearly 3%.""The drop in Disney this morning looks to be tied to the company's ongoing contract negotiations with Charter Communications,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. ""Another source of concern sits with the ongoing strikes with both actors and writers in Hollywood.""Charter said Disney rejected its proposal for a new distribution deal that takes into account the rise of competing low-cost streaming services, which has fueled cord-cutting among its customers. The cable provider said it pays Disney $2.2 billion in annual programming costs, excluding advertising.""Disney - so far - has insisted on a traditional long-term deal with higher rates and limited packaging flexibility,"" Charter said in a presentation published on Friday.Disney said on Thursday it has reached successful deals with pay TV providers across the country and that the rates and terms it sought with Charter ""are driven by the marketplace.""""This Charter-Disney deal not going through here has spooked a little bit of the market, at least that sector,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst at Triple D Trading.(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Amruta Khandeka and Khushi Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Michelle Price and Richard Chang)]"

But is the stock modestly undervalued? Let's delve into a thorough valuation analysis to find out.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with FOXA. Click here to check it out. FOXA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FOXAFox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) is a media conglomerate, holding assets not sold to Disney by its predecessor, Twenty First Century Fox, in 2019. Its portfolio includes Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, and 28 owned and operated local television stations. Since the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other assets, including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, banking on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market. With a current stock price of $31.69, Fox's market cap stands at $14.90 billion. But how does this compare with its GF Value, an estimation of fair value?Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideSummarizing the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GF Value, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) appears to be modestly undervalued. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns.

Fedwire is the settlement system of central bank money operated by the U.S. Federal Reserve banks.“It is remarkable that in just a few years, a new global money movement rail can be compared with some of the world’s largest and most important payment systems,” the asset manager said.Brevan Howard Digital notes that over 25 million blockchain addresses hold over $1 in stablecoins. In terms of a comparison with traditional finance, a U.S. bank with 25 million accounts would rank as the fifth largest by number of accounts. The large number of small-dollar stablecoin holdings also shows the “potential for stablecoins to provide global financial services to customers underserved by traditional financial institutions.”Story continues“Stablecoin usage has shown a low correlation with crypto exchange volumes,” which suggests that significant stablecoin transactions volumes are likely being used for non-speculative purposes, the report said.Stablecoins have also shown resilience in the recent crypto market downturn, with total market cap only dropping about 24% from its peak, compared with a 57% decline for the total crypto market cap, the note added.Read more: PayPal’s Stablecoin Not Likely to Be Used Widely Anytime Soon: Bank of America]"

Shares have added about 6.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NCR due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.NCR Corporation Q2 Earnings and Revenues Beat EstimatesNCR delivered better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 results. NCR’s second-quarter non-GAAP earnings increased 3% year over year to 94 cents per share and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents.Lower direct costs, such as reductions in fuel, shipping and component costs, along with a higher-margin revenue mix and indirect cost mitigation actions, were accretive to the company’s second-quarter bottom line. However, the strong U.S. dollar and a higher tax rate reduced non-GAAP earnings by 5 cents and 9 cents per share, respectively.In the second quarter of 2023, NCR reported revenues of $1.99 billion, beating the consensus mark of $1.95 billion. However, the top line witnessed a year-over-year decrease of 1%. Unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted second-quarter revenues by approximately $18 million. NCR stated that the second-quarter top line was flat year over year on a constant-currency basis.NCR progressed significantly with its strategic growth initiatives, which are transforming it into a software platform and payments company. The company’s recurring revenues improved by 4% to $1.26 billion in the quarter under review.Segment DetailsFrom the first quarter of 2022, NCR changed its reporting segments to correspond with changes to its operating model, management structure and organizational responsibilities. The new reportable revenue segments are Payments &amp; Network, Digital Banking, Self-Service Banking, Retail and Hospitality.Story continuesPayments &amp; Network revenues remained flat at $333 million. NCR’s Digital Banking Solution revenues increased 7% to $140 million. Hospitality revenues decreased 1% to $235 million. Our estimates for the Payments &amp; Network, Digital banking Solution and Hospitality segments were pegged at $324.7 million, $134.6 million and $232.4 million, respectively.In the second quarter, Self-Service Banking revenues decreased 3% to $661 million, while Retail revenues grew 2% to $576 million. Our revenue estimates for the Self-Service Banking and Retail segments were pegged at $649.6 million and $561.1 million.Operating DetailsThe non-GAAP gross profit of $576 million was up 12% year over year. Moreover, the non-GAAP gross margin rate expanded 310 basis points (bps) to 29%, mainly due to a reduction in direct costs (fuel, shipping and component costs), a richer revenue mix of high-margin software and services and the benefits of indirect cost-mitigation actions taken last year as well as in early 2023.Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% year over year to $279 million. As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 14% from 14.2% in the year-ago quarter due to improved productivity.The non-GAAP operating income increased 27% year over year to $297 million, primarily driven by the higher gross profit and a reduction in operating expenses. As a result, the non-GAAP operating margin improved 330 bps to 15% in the second quarter.Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.7% year over year to $389 million despite a negative impact of $6 million due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 bps to 19.6%.Balance Sheet &amp; Other DetailsNCR exited the June-end quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $547 million compared with the $519 million reported during the March-end quarter.The company generated operating cash flow of $227 million in the second quarter and $544 million in the first half of full-year 2023. NCR generated adjusted free cash flow – Unrestricted of $154 million in the second quarter and $363 million in the first half of 2023.GuidanceNCR reaffirmed its outlook for the full-year 2023. However, considering the strong first-half results, the company stated that it expects key metrics to come in at the higher end of the guided ranges. It continues to project revenues between $7.8 billion and $8 billion for the full-year 2023.Furthermore, it still forecasts non-GAAP EPS in the band of $3.30-$3.50 under the new methodology. During its fourth-quarter 2022 results, NCR had stated that it would exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expenses from the non-GAAP diluted EPS calculation from 2023. Up to 2022, the company included stock-based compensation expenses in the non-GAAP calculation. The change in methodology will inflate its EPS.Coming to the 2023 guidance, the company continues to project adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.45-$1.55 billion. NCR still expects to generate free cash flow in the band of $400-$500 million in 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 15.35% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, NCR has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

173,dc91c202-08ea-328e-8b43-537fd9a1c77d,IBM,2023-09-02,Investors Heavily Search International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-international-business-130012121.html,1693573212,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +1.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share, indicating a change of +17.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.86 indicates a change of +4.5% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.82 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $61.49 billion and $64.08 billion estimates indicate +1.6% and +4.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was +9%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, General Motors Company has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that GM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FOXF has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.GM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.40, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 21.83. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.45. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 2.10.Another notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.61. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 3.89.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help GM earn a Value grade of A, while FOXF has been given a Value grade of C.GM has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than FOXF, so it seems like value investors will conclude that GM is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The fact that the rate is still under 4% is ""a sign of strong, stable growth that we would want in a strong economy,"" Su tells Yahoo Finance Live.

Secretary Su, thank you so much for joining me. It's great to see you.JULIE SU: You too.- The labor force participation rate bumped up last month. It's now at the highest level since pre-pandemic, February 2020. At the same time, we saw the unemployment rate go up, more people coming into the workforce, more people looking for work. Your take.JULIE SU: That's exactly right, and those two things are connected. So more people coming to the labor force, it's a sign of optimism, right? That recovery has happened faster than anybody predicted after the pandemic, and that did result in a slight increase in the unemployment rate, but it still remains under 4%, which is now the longest stretch since the 1960s, so very much a sign of strong, stable growth that we would want in a strong economy.- Even though we saw some cooling on that top line number, it's still a very tight job market, to your point. But given that we're seeing now fewer job openings, still quite a-- quite a lot, but still fewer, and now more people entering the labor force, what's the prospect that the power will shift from the worker to the employer maybe come next year?Story continuesJULIE SU: Yeah, so the president's economic policy, his Investing in America agenda, has always been about not just addressing our roads and bridges and need for clean energy and the manufacturing boom, but creating more good jobs in all communities across the country, and we're seeing continued job growth in exactly that way. What we now are really focused on, especially here at the Department of Labor, is making sure that everybody has access to those jobs, that we're creating equitable pathways so that everybody can share in the prosperity that continues to characterize this economy under Bidenomics.- I want to ask you about the United Auto Workers Union talks right now. They have threatened to strike if they're not able to reach a deal with the major automakers. President Biden has expressed concern about a potential strike. What are you hearing now from both parties?JULIE SU: Right, so to take one step back on that, we've talked about this tight labor market and workers having more power. One of the features of that is that unions also have more power to make demands at the bargaining table, and we've seen the positive effects of that over President Biden's tenure. We've seen increases in wages in bargaining agreements. We've seen addressing other issues, right? The teamsters and UPS reached an agreement that also has air conditioning in trucks, like thinking about what makes a good job in multiple different ways.The president believes, as I do, in the collective bargaining process, and part of that is allowing the parties to do what they need to do, respecting that process, and encouraging them to stay at the table, which we want to see, but that is certainly what continues to happen, at least for now, in those UAW talks.- Really quick, do you think we can avoid a strike?JULIE SU: I don't want to predict that, but I think any time the parties are at the table and talking to each other, that's a good thing.- Speaking of unions, the Treasury put out a brand new white paper this week showing that unions help the middle class. Union workers can see wages of 10% to 15% higher, and that can actually spill over to help non-union workers. Though, given that union membership is so low right, now what kind of impact can we expect to see, and if we had higher union membership, what type of a different job picture would we see in terms of both job creation and wage growth, which is already robust now?JULIE SU: Yeah, we're also seeing the highest level of support for unions in public opinion polls since 1965, so I also think that is not accidental. This is very much a part of when you have a president who is saying that we want an economy where workers get their fair share. We want the jobs we create, as much as possible, to be good union jobs because of those benefits, because of job security, because of wage growth, because of other kinds of benefits in union jobs that also have an upward effect on working conditions elsewhere, that those are all very, very positive things and very much a part of how the president sees a good, strong economy.- You and I have talked about closing the gender pay gap and women's equal pay. How do you think unions can play into perhaps closing that pay gap?JULIE SU: So studies show that unions have a positive effect on closing both the racial and the gender wage gaps. That's another reason why the more we can create good union jobs in all communities across the country, this is going to be a positive thing. Now, the Department of Labor is really focused on that access to those jobs, right? If you look at jobs like construction, those jobs still largely remain male-dominated, and so we are investing across the country in programs that are creating pathways for women. Like in Chicago, we are investing in a program called Women Building Infrastructure, Trades Women Building Infrastructure, and that's a way that we're going to expand more equitable access to job security and the kind of breathing room for families that we want.- Is there anything that the Labor Department can do specifically when it comes to writing rules to offer more transparency, to help close the pay gap? Is there a way to prevent discrimination based on gender? Is there a way to mandate perhaps that women that have commensurate experience with men in the same position, who are performing, are entitled to and should get equal pay to their male counterpart?JULIE SU: So this is where it's really important for us to think about-- you know, everything we've talked about is about building the high road to the middle class, right? Good jobs, access to those good jobs in all communities. In order to do that, we also have to combat the low road, meaning we have to enforce the law to make sure that everybody is playing by the same set of rules, and that means that women should be paid in the workplace what they-- if there's a disparity in pay that is illegal, there should be enforcement of that.But the other piece of it, and we've talked about this before, is addressing occupational segregation. Making sure that in these certain jobs, like I mentioned construction, where women tend to be underrepresented but there are good jobs, pathways to the middle class, that we open up those paths to women too.- Well, Secretary, I know this is an issue that you and I have talked about before, and I hope we can continue talking about it in the future. Thank you so, so much for your insight. I so appreciate it.JULIE SU: Thank you so much.]"
177,da452985-9a48-320a-9cab-c7d921c4d2bf,GM,2023-09-02,Ride the Domestic Auto Industry's Resilience With These 2 Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ride-domestic-auto-industrys-resilience-133500261.html,1693575300,STORY,"['PCAR', '^GSPC', 'GM']","[Despite concerns over higher borrowing costs, Americans' unwavering love for cars and pent-up demand are boosting the outlook of the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry. The industry is set to benefit from strong consumer demand and improved inventory levels, rising incentives and the surging popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). Capitalizing on favorable market trends, domestic automakers are enjoying robust recovery and growth as they overcome pandemic-related challenges. Investors can ride the industry’s strength with stocks like General Motors GM and PACCAR PCAR to fetch handsome gains.About the IndustryThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesDemand Remains Strong Despite High Borrowing Costs:  At the outset of 2023, industry experts anticipated a potential deceleration in the U.S. car market amid the increased cost of vehicle financing. However, consumer demand demonstrated greater resilience than anticipated. New vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, implying year-over-year and sequential growth of roughly 15% and 13%, respectively. Over the first six months, the market achieved sales of approximately 7.69 million units, reflecting a 12.3% increase from the same period in 2022. The demand for automobiles remains strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates has not yet significantly affected purchasing decisions. Quoting Cox Automotive's chief economist Jonathan Smoke, ""Consumers have found a way to buy new wheels.” Although the Fed has indicated the possibility of more rate hikes in the near future, the U.S. vehicle sales outlook for 2023 remains strong. Cox Automotive forecasts full-year vehicle sales at around 15 million units, up from 13.9 million units in 2022.Story continuesImproving Inventory Levels: Supply constraints have been considerably alleviated. Limited new-vehicle inventory over the past two years that had handcuffed sales is no longer a pressing concern. According to Cox Automotive, new vehicle inventory levels in the United States saw a significant increase of more than 70% in July compared to the same period last year. This increase in inventory availability bodes well for the industry, signaling a potential shift toward a more balanced state between supply and demand. Robust inventories are leading to richer incentives and sweeter discount deals. Incentives increased for the 10th straight month in July to the highest level since October 2021. All these factors are driving the prospects of the industry.Soaring EV Popularity: Heightened climate change concerns, advancements in technology, and strict fuel-emission regulations are resulting in the widespread adoption of eco-friendly vehicles. The demand for electric vehicles is on an upward trajectory, consistently setting new sales records. Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States. Additionally, 2023 is poised to be a landmark year, with U.S. EV sales projected to surpass 1 million units for the first time. Established car manufacturers are putting in substantial efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. Further, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to provide a further boost to EV sales. With this ongoing momentum and the anticipated growth ahead, the U.S. auto industry's outlook in the EV market appears promising.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #72, which places it in the top 29% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 7% over the past six months.Before we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and sector over the past year. The industry has lost 14.2% against the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 15.1%. The sector has declined 7.1% over the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 17.49X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 13.46X and the sector’s 12.53X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 58.44X, as low as 8.78X and at a median of 18.54X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)2 Stocks to BuyGeneral Motors: One of the world’s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022. General Motors’ compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bodes well. The company’s hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line.  Encouragingly, this legacy U.S. automaker will have nine EV models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. Its superior liquidity profile also instills confidence. General Motors’ strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.GM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 9.25%. The consensus mark for GM’s 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 12 cents and 15 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 22.6%.Price &amp; Consensus: GMPACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising the XF, XG and XD models, is driving the firm’s revenues. Continued growth in aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine — bodes well. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR’s prospects. A solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind. PACCAR’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 19% and 48.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for PCAR’s 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 70 cents and 38 cents, respectively, over the past 60 days.

The move is aimed to reduce labor costs as the package delivery firm struggles with a decline in demand scenario. The weak freight market has hurt overall volumes.At present, UPS employs around 3,400 pilots. The company expects 167 pilots to accept this voluntary retirement offer.  The separation scheme is quite lucrative as it includes cash as well as healthcare-related benefits. This is, in fact, the first time since 2010 that UPS has decided to reduce employments of its pilots. In 2010, UPS had furloughed 109 pilots, per the report mentioned above.We remind investors that in August, while releasing second-quarter 2023 results, management trimmed its current-year revenue outlook. UPS now expects 2023 revenues to be around $93 billion (prior view: $97 billion). Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook.Due to these headwinds, UPS shares have declined 2.6% year to date compared with its industry’s 10.3% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like United Airlines UALand Air Transport Services ATSG.UAL and ATSG currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each.

180,0f2f8696-198a-30a7-9f2b-a365d5f74823,UAL,2023-09-02,Comfort Systems USA and DICK'S Sporting Goods have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comfort-systems-usa-dicks-sporting-120000999.html,1693569600,STORY,"['FIX', 'DAL', 'UAL', 'AAL', '^GSPC', 'DKS']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 1, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Comfort Systems USA FIX as the Bull of the Day and DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc. DKS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Delta Air Lines DAL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Comfort Systems USA provides comprehensive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement services.The company performs most of its services within manufacturing plants, office buildings, retail centers, apartment complexes, and healthcare, education, and government facilities.Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company's earnings outlook, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company resides within the Zacks Building Products – Air Conditioner and Heating industry, currently ranked in the top 2% of all Zacks industries due to positive earnings estimate revisions.As many know, roughly half of a stock's movement can be attributed to its group, helping to clarify the importance of targeting industries seeing bright outlooks.Aside from the improved earnings outlook and favorable industry standing, let's take a closer look at a few other traits of Comfort Systems USA.Comfort Systems USAThe company sports a solid growth profile, with Zacks Consensus Estimates suggesting 44% EPS growth on 21% higher revenues in its current year. And peeking ahead to FY24, expectations allude to a further 15% improvement in earnings paired with a 15% revenue bump. FIX carries a Style Score of ""B"" for Growth.Income-focused investors could be attracted to FIX also, with shares currently yielding a respectable 0.5% annually. While the yield may be on the lower end, the company's 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.In addition, the company has been a stellar earnings performer, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of more than 20% across its last four releases. Just in its latest release, Comfort Systems USA posted an 18% EPS beat and reported revenue 7% above expectations.Story continuesThe company's top line growth has remained steady and accelerated in recent quarters.Perhaps to the surprise of some, shares have long-time outperformed the general market in a big way, annualizing a sizable 29% return over the last decade vs. the S&amp;P 500's 12.8%. FIX shares have seen bullish activity following each of its previous three quarterly releases.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Comfort Systems USA would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc. is a significant omnichannel sporting goods retailer that offers athletic shoes, apparel, accessories, and a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, fishing, tennis, golf, water sports, and more.Analysts have slashed their earnings expectations as of late, pushing the stock down into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let's take a closer look at a few other characteristics of DKS.DICK'S Sporting GoodsThe company's latest quarterly report disappointed investors, with DKS falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 25% and delivering a fractional revenue surprise. Earnings declined 24% year-over-year, whereas revenue climbed 3.6% from the same period last year.The company's profitability picture was massively impacted by elevated inventory shrink, a phenomenon DKS says many retailers are currently facing. And to top it off, DKS lowered its FY23 EPS outlook, causing shares to plummet post-earnings.Shares now yield 3.5% annually following the sell-off, with a payout ratio sitting at 34% of the company's earnings. It's worth noting that the company has been committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, sporting a 25% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.In addition, DKS shares presently trade at a 9.4X forward earnings multiple (F1), below the 10.8X five-year median and the respective Zacks industry average. Shares have traded as high as 12.5X in 2023.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and a recent negative quarterly print paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.DICK'S Sporting Goods is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:Buy Labor Day Weekend Await U.S. Airlines: 3 Stocks to WatchIt is a well-documented fact that air travel demand has bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows. Driven by the buoyant passenger volumes in the current summer season, which has been the busiest one ever, the upcoming Labor Day holiday period is expected to be a very busy one for U.S. airlines.The bullish expectation of the Transportation Security Administration or TSA pertaining to traffic volumes during the Labor Day holiday weekend further highlights the encouraging scenario. Therefore, we believe that investors interested in the industry would do well to keep U.S. airline stocks like United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines on their radar.With people taking to the skies in a big way in the post-COVID period, the airline industry, one of the hardest hit corners in the pandemic peak, is currently in good shape. Driven by the concept of 'Revenge travel', a term emanating from the prolonged periods of lockdown, people remain eager to undertake a flight despite headwinds like flight disruptions caused by labor shortages. Revenge travel highlights a strong desire to travel in response to the monotony and exhaustion of life caused by the COVID-19-induced lockdown.Driven by the travel surge, the Federal Aviation Administration expects the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend to be the third busiest one in 2023 so far, after the Juneteenth weekend, which was inclusive of Father's Day, and the break for Presidents Day.The TSA's ProjectionThe TSA anticipates screening more than 14 million passengers in the Sep 1-Sep 6 period, despite the likely disruptions caused by the tropical storm Idalia. The busiest day during the period is likely to be Sep 1. On that day, TSA expects to screen more than 2.7 million travelers passing through security checkpoints.Per TSA administrator David Pekoske, ""We anticipate this Labor Day holiday weekend will be busy, with passenger volumes nearly 11% higher than last year, volumes that already exceeded 2019 Labor Day holiday travel volumes.""Highlighting the upbeat air-travel demand scenario, the TSA stated that it has screened approximately 227.5 million passengers since the Memorial Day weekend. This translates into an average of 2.5 million per day. To aid travel, many U.S. airlines are offering low fares for passengers who book their travel by Labor Day.Given this rosy scenario, we have highlighted three airline stocks, that investors should keep tabs on.Our ChoicesUnited Airlines: UAL is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and international air travel demand. Anticipating to be extremely busy over the Labor Day holiday period, UAL's management expects that nearly 2.8 million passengers will travel by its flights in the Aug 31-Sep 5 period.Riding on the buoyant air traffic scenario, UAL shares have gained 32.9% year to date. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other occasion. The average beat was 17.2%. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereAmerican Airlines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. To meet the anticipated demand swell over the Aug 31-Sep 5 period, AAL aims to operate approximately 32,000 flights during this period. The carrier expects that nearly 3.5 million passengers will travel by its flights in the above timeframe.AAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the last four quarters, with an average of 19.2%. AAL shares have gained 16.1% year to date.Delta Air Lines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is likely to aid Delta in attracting significant traffic during the Labor Day holiday period.DAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other two occasions. The average beat was 2.1%. DAL shares have gained 31.5% year to date.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The stock started September near its all-time high but closed slightly off the record price at $161.56 on Friday.So far this year, the company's shares are up more than 13%. That's higher than the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (^DJI) year-to-date gain of almost 5% and significantly outpaces Target stock (TGT), which is down nearly 16%.Why Walmart is winning: groceriesAs consumers' wallets remain pinched with inflation, Walmart's expanding grocery business has been its gateway to consumers who are otherwise more cautious about their discretionary spending.""This is where we're seeing that Walmart has the upper hand compared to Target,"" LSEG director of consumer research Jharonne Martis told Yahoo Finance Live. ""They've gained those loyal customers because of groceries, and now that's converting into them extending themselves and buying general merchandise.""In the retail giant's second quarter earnings results, Walmart posted same-store sales that rose 6.3%, more than the 4.04% expected, according to data from Bloomberg.Foot traffic also increased for Walmart, up 2.8%, along with a higher ticket and online sales in the quarter.On a call with investors, CEO Doug McMillon called its customers ""resilient.""""They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them,"" McMillon said. ""We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs.

""That said, we think it's probably worth monitoring the potentially budding price investments at Kroger and Albertsons.""Goldman also noted that Target's pricing premium is down to 6% from 8% in May and June.""That's the lowest gap versus Walmart since November 2019 (the typical gap has been 8-10%),"" Goldman said.

Here some of Yahoo Finance Live's top takeaways.Lower income households are feeling recessionary, as recent earnings reports from retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe’s (LOW) show a cautious consumer, as they pull back on big-ticket spending and shift to spending on services versus goods. Yahoo Finance’s Brad Smith notes ""consumers are continuing to be extremely judicious"" about where they’re purchasing items.The July JOLTS report showed that the number of job openings slipped to 8.8 million in July, which fell short of the expected 9.5 million.Companies such as Dollar General (DG), Five Below (FIVE), and Nordstrom (JWN), all said they are feeling the impact of shrink hitting their bottom lines.Barbie, Beyoncé’s ‘Renaissance World Tour,’ and Taylor Swift ‘Eras Tour’ have had quite the impact on the economy, as they benefit from the consumer shift in spending on services over goods.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, speaking of things being busy, a busy week for corporate earnings and economic data. As we enter the first trading day of September, let's recap some of the biggest lessons that we learned this week.First up, lower income households are feeling recessionary. I mean, we're seeing people really pulling back more than ever. We heard in the earnings calls. We know that people are really bracing for what we're seeing with student loan repayments set to start back up. And so I think every little seed that's being planted, is saying, look the consumer has run out of that pandemic money, they're trading down or trading off some of these more expensive things.And then when you factor in, when you look at those big gas prices on top of everything else, it's just-- it's a very tough time for the consumer right now. And it's starting to show up in some of the price action.BRAD SMITH: One of the acknowledgments from BlackRock, the lower income parts of the economy are certainly feeling a little bit more of the pressure, especially considering the extent to which inflation has needed to be combated to this point. And particularly, BlackRock's Rick Rieder who had said off the back of Fed Chair Jay Powell's commentary even-- and Jackson Hole recently saying that the higher rates right now is an overly regressive tax on lower income households and consequently expands the income and wealth gap in the country here.Story continuesAnd if there's anything that you've looked across, many of the details that have come forward over the course of this retail earnings season is that consumers are continuing to be extremely judicious about where they're purchasing big ticket appliances, where they're purchasing televisions even, or even the types of clothes or apparel that they are buying. And so that particularly is of note and could spell out a little bit more of how consumers across income levels are thinking about their spends, even amid this shift to services spending as well, which we'll get to in a hot second.But one of the other things that we've tracked over this most recent month here, the number of job openings, that slipped. And we saw this show up in the most recent JOLTS reading. We got that at the tail end of August. And perhaps something for the Fed to pay attention to here is that it's now taking us to, I believe, the lowest level of openings since mid-2021 here. So that particularly, and I think, it was, to be exact, July of 2021 and thereabouts.And so ultimately, as we think about where more of those jobs are still continuing to need to be added on, it is in a lot of the more labor intensive parts of the economy, and that showed up in today's employment situation as well, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. And I mean, I remember at the beginning of the year, we talked about some of these layoffs that we were seeing in tech. That's still continuing to happen. I mean, we spoke Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray, &amp; Christmas earlier this week. And he said, so far this year, employers announced plans to cut 481,900 jobs. That's a 203% jump, compared to the first seven months of last year.So we're still continuing to see this cutting of jobs. We also talked about this quiet cutting, where we're also seeing people getting reassigned into other jobs as well. And that's not necessarily showing up in the jobs data, but showing some of the minimizing that we're seeing. And as we were just talking about with our guest here, a lot of these companies doing well. But it's because of some of these cost-cutting measures that are showing up in some of these job cuts, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Spot on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And then, of course, I also want to shift gears because we're also seeing shrinkflation hitting Brick &amp; Mortar retailers. I mean, we heard from retailers reporting, all this week and last week as well shrink, whether that's from mostly that we're seeing from theft or from damage, continuing to bite that bottom line there, Brad.BRAD SMITH: I mean-- and it's across retailers. You've got it at the high end, you've got it at mid, and then also at the lower side. You heard this from Dollar General. You also heard this from Target who many of us have perhaps had some type of shopping experience at, where you walk up to even just get some body wash. You're just trying to stay clean and hygienic at home. And you still got to wait for somebody to walk over after you wave your hand, wand your hand in front of a sensor for them to come open it up for you. That's a change in experience and the customer experience there.And then even at the top end and for Nordstrom, what we saw in the more viral video, they acknowledged that on their earnings call. And so it's really across the spectrum that shrink is impacting many of these retailers as it was brought up on all of these conference calls in one form or another and changing the way that they think about their inventory management, especially in store as well.But even as we're thinking about those shopping for goods out there, the shift has really been into services, Rachelle. Of course, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Greta Gerwig's movie, ""Barbie,"" they are benefiting amid a consumer spending shift. And I don't know if you got dressed up to go see ""Barbie"" movie like I did, Rachelle. But I know you actually did go see Beyonce, so you're part of that shift.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I contributed to both the ""Barbie"" economy and the Beyonce economy. I already own a lot of pink. But yes, even when I knew the ""Barbie"" movie was coming out, I made sure I had my lovely, giant, pink Telfar bag. I was all the way ready. And so it's really a decision that we're seeing that people are being very discerning about what they're spending on. They might not spend as much on other things, but they are prioritizing certain things.I was not about to give up Beyonce tickets. I was like, I'd never seen her perform. It's one of those things where it's that revenge spending. It's like, look, if I'm going to spend on something, it better be something that's worth it.BRAD SMITH: Look, I agree with you. They almost got me. I almost bought some tickets to see Beyonce in Houston because where else to see the Queen Bee than her hometown? So I don't know. But I almost was part of both the travel spending economy and then, additionally, the concert and just making sure that you're enjoying the experience part of the economy as well. So I almost got got. But ultimately, it probably would have been a great time too. It hasn't happened yet. So maybe I can go get it at some point. I don't know. It's too expensive for me.]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Intuitive Surgical, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$14b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 13%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.2% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceIn the above chart we have measured Intuitive Surgical's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Intuitive Surgical here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Intuitive Surgical doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 13% from 20% five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWhile returns have fallen for Intuitive Surgical in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 73% to shareholders over the last five years. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.If you're still interested in Intuitive Surgical it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.While Intuitive Surgical may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

190,cda9e7a1-e229-361b-a6bf-4bb8c6a492a4,RF,2023-09-02,Regions Financial (RF) Aided by NII & Loan Growth Amid Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-aided-nii-171100280.html,1693588260,STORY,['RF'],"[Regions Financial Corporation RF is well-poised to benefit from the expected rise in net interest income (NII) supported by higher rates and healthy average loan balance trends. Additionally, its buyouts seem encouraging for growth. However, pressure on mortgage income, lack of diversification in the loan portfolio and elevated expenses are key headwinds.Regions Financial remains focused on improving its NII. Over the last three years (2019-2022), the bank's NII witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5%, with the uptrend continuing in the first half of 2023. Given its asset-sensitive balance sheet, it is most likely that the bank’s NII and net interest margin will continue to improve on the back of high interest rates in the upcoming period. Management expects NII to increase 12-14% on a year-over-year basis in 2023.Moreover, the company has a strong lending pipeline, which is expected to drive loan growth. This, too, is likely to support RF’s NII growth in the quarters ahead. Notably, over the past three years (ended 2022), total loans witnessed a CAGR of 5.2%, with the momentum continuing in the first six months of 2023. For the current year, management expects total loans to grow around 3-4% on a year-over-year basis.Regions Financial continues to explore opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions, primarily in mortgage servicing rights. Its 2021 buyout of Clearsight, Sabal Capital and EnerBank USA, enabled it to diversify its revenue sources. Its commitment to diversify its revenue streams and meeting customer needs via diverse services is expected to support its long-term growth prospects.Regions Financial maintains a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. As of Jun 30, 2023, it had long-term borrowings of $4.29 billion, while its liquidity sources aggregated $52.9 billion. It also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, rendering it favorable access to the debt market. Hence, with strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, RF seems well-positioned to meet its debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens.Story continuesFurther, the company’s meaningful capital deployment efforts through regular dividend payments and share repurchases are likely to continue enhancing its shareholder wealth.Analysts seem optimistic regarding RF’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has been revised marginally upward over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of RF have gained 1.6% compared with the industry's upside of 3.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, Regions Financial continues to record an increase in expenses, with non-interest expenses experiencing a CAGR of 5.3% over the 2019-2022 period. The rising trend continued in the first six months of 2023.With expenses likely to continue increasing in the forthcoming period, RF’s bottom line may be negatively impacted in the near term. Although the company is committed to generating positive adjusted operating leverage in 2023, management expects adjusted non-interest expenses to increase approximately 6.5% on a year-over-year basis.Regions Financial’s mortgage income, a key component of its non-interest income, witnessed a negative CAGR of 1.5% over the 2019-2022 period. Moreover, the metric declined in the first half of 2023, as higher market interest rates resulted in lower mortgage production and sales.It is likely that with the high mortgage rates in place, residential first mortgage loan origination volume and margins will be under distress in the upcoming period. This may adversely impact mortgage income further.Regions Financial’s loan portfolio is mainly comprised of commercial loans, which include commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending. Given the current rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates, commercial lending in the near term is likely to be under some pressure. Thus, a lack of loan portfolio diversification may hurt the company’s financials if the economic situation worsens.Bank Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are Live Oak Bancshares LOB and Bank7 BSVN.Live Oak currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its earnings estimates for 2023 have been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days. In the past three months, LOB’s shares have rallied 31.5%.

Here, we spotlight a Texas small-business owner helping mothers and daughters strengthen their relationships and mental wellness. Learn more about Lacey Tezino's unexpected path to entrepreneurship and how the Regions Foundation, a nonprofit funded primarily by Regions Bank, is elevating small-business owners like her.""Why did it take a terminal illness for us to get there? Why weren't we doing that already?""These are the questions Lacey Tezino repeatedly asked herself during her mother's end-of-life journey. The same questions that served as a catalyst behind her launching Passport Journeys, a small business helping others avoid a similar experience.But before we get to the end of Tezino's journey with her mom, we need to start at its beginning.""My childhood was unique in that I was the only Black child in my school, my church,"" Tezino said of her small-town upbringing in Southeast Texas. ""I was adopted by a gay white man and raised by his parents.""The man who adopted her passed away when she was just six. At 18, Tezino decided to search for her birth mother.""I met my mom on Mother's Day,"" Tezino said.Both women had experienced different aspects of anguish.""I had resentment on my side for her giving me up; she had guilt on her side,"" explained Tezino. ""It was frustrating.""They worked toward understanding the other's perspectives - two steps forward, one step back during the nine years following their reconnection. Then came devastating news.""She was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer,"" said Tezino. ""It really woke us up that time was running out.""The Road to ReconciliationTezino moved back to Texas from Qatar, where she'd been climbing the corporate ladder, to take care of her mom. Those initial days weren't easy.""There was resentment from her because of the chemotherapy's harsh effects that led to arguments and underlying feelings,"" Tezino recalled. ""My mom told me, &amp;lsquo;I'm only doing the treatment for you.' I also had moments of thinking, &amp;lsquo;How do I take care of someone who wouldn't have taken care of me?'""But the two began making the most of their remaining time through deep conversations.""She wanted to be sure she had a legacy she could leave,"" said Tezino. ""She was very intentional about sharing stories with me. During her treatments, we leaned into our relationship needing work. When she lost her hair, I shaved my hair. It was us writing the story the way we wanted it to go.""Those conversations planted a seed that didn't bloom until after Tezino's mom died in 2014. The next year, Tezino started conducting mother-daughter workshops and then creating a mother-daughter activity book she sold online.Each mother-daughter duo works with a therapist assigned to their journey.""I want therapists who have their own story with their mom or their daughter,"" said Tezino.The Path to PeopleFundWhen Tezino began exploring ways to grow Passport Journeys, she turned to Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) PeopleFund for support. The organization empowers under-resourced Texas entrepreneurs through education and training programs, coaching and loans. The Regions Foundation has worked alongside PeopleFund for several years to help small businesses succeed.Through PeopleFund's coaching, Tezino met Anthony Lopez, a small-business specialist with the CDFI. Lopez immediately saw something special in Tezino and her business model.""Lacey's positivity and &amp;lsquo;never say quit' attitude are strong attributes for a business owner,"" said Lopez. ""The services Passport Journey provides can shed some light for those who are going through the same dark journey Lacey did, maybe meaning the road won't be so difficult for them. By sharing her experience and knowledge, Lacey is shining a light to inspire others.""Tezino will tell you Lopez has certainly inspired her.""Anthony is motivational; he's reliable,"" she said. ""He listens; he really cares about me; he always sends great notes after our calls to share what we covered. And he gets me pumped up before I pitch my business to others.""Tezino also received a $50,000 loan from PeopleFund to help with expanding Passport Journeys, which now has nine therapists serving mother-daughter duos.In addition to growing her company, Tezino recently wrote a memoir called ""Therapy After Mom Died.""""I don't think I properly grieved my mom until 2020 when I began my own teletherapy journey,"" she said. ""Our last year together was an interesting year, a beautiful year, a painful year. I want to build a business that urges other mother-daughter pairs to build a relationship that doesn't require a terminal illness.""It's a journey Tezino never anticipated. The memories are still painful at times. But the seeds that were sown are still blooming - making relationships brighter for other daughters and mothers whose journeys are far from over.Capital: Launching A Springboard for Small Business SuccessSimilar to the mother-daughter relationships served by Passport Journeys, PeopleFund loan officer Cindy Urrutia will tell you each client she assists navigates their own small-business path as well. Urrutia, who worked with Lacey Tezino, shares more here.""Starting a business is a sensitive time for any entrepreneur in understanding how much capital they need and how to best use it to succeed,"" said Urrutia. ""The most rewarding part of being a loan officer is having the opportunity to help my client's idea become a reality! PeopleFund does that by helping small businesses bridge expenses like payroll or buying equipment and furniture to complete their new space.""We're here to help business owners start stress free. That matters because small businesses are essential to our communities in creating new jobs and contributing to economic growth.""About the Regions Foundation The Regions Foundation supports community investments that positively impact the communities served by Regions Bank. The Foundation engages in a grantmaking program focused on priorities including economic and community development; education and workforce readiness; and financial wellness. The Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation funded primarily through contributions from Regions Bank.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.

If you want to skip our in-depth analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Companies to Work for in 2023.As we step into 2023, the adage ""people are a company's greatest asset"" has never rung truer. The competitive edge now hinges on more than just profit margins and market share; it rests firmly on a company's ability to foster an environment where innovation thrives, where diversity is celebrated, and where employees find not just a job, but a genuine sense of purpose. Let’s explore what are the current trends driving employment around the world.Employment Trends in 2023 and the Key Players Remote and hybrid work have become undeniable trends that are reshaping the modern workforce. In 2023, 12.7% of full-time employees already work remotely, and 28.2% have embraced a hybrid work model that indicates the rapid evolution of work environments. Looking ahead, it's predicted that by 2025, about 32.6 million Americans, equivalent to 22% of the workforce, will be working remotely. These trends are driven by strong employee preferences as 98% of workers express a desire to work remotely at least some of the time, all thanks to the flexibility, autonomy, and improved work-life balance that remote work offers. Moreover, 93% of employers plan to continue conducting job interviews remotely. Remote and hybrid work have become integral to the modern work landscape, and their growth is expected to continue as both employees and employers recognize the benefits of these models. Speaking of remote work, do check out our article on best work from home jobs for 2023. It is also worth noting that remote work equally benefits employers by reducing overhead costs associated with office space and utilities and hence, increasing access to a global talent pool, and boost employee productivity and job satisfaction. It can lead to lower employee turnover rates and the ability to tap into specialized skills from anywhere, ultimately resulting in cost savings and a more diverse, efficient, and agile workforce.Story continuesAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s Chief People Officer, Gloria Chen recently mentioned: ""While we believe in the value of in-person interactions, we know that in some cases, a remote work arrangement makes sense for Adobe. We expect to double the size of our remote worker population over time as we learn and iterate on making this model successful.""Moreover, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s employees were also the happiest employees as they felt most satisfied with their pay, according to Comparably’s sixth annual report based on employee reviews. Another employment trend for 2023 is that organizations will drive DEI forward with growing pushback. To achieve the DEI goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has established 12 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which serve as platforms for employees to connect, engage, and unleash their potential. These ERGs also play a pivotal role in cultivating relationship capital and cultivating an inclusive environment and culture within the company.In terms of specific diversity goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has set ambitious targets. By 2025, the company aims to have 50% women in management positions worldwide that highlight its commitment to gender diversity. Additionally, in the United States, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is striving for 35% racial diversity in management roles. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s dedication to diversity and inclusion has also garnered recognition and accolades from various quarters. For example, it has been acknowledged by U.S. Veterans Magazine as the ""Best of the Best"" for its strides in advancing diversity efforts. Additionally, the company stands out as one of only two organizations that have consistently been included in the Working Mother 100 Best list for the past 28 years.20 Best Companies to Work for in 2023wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have looked at different surveys and indexes employed for the best companies to work for including Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For, Glassdoor’s best places to work 2023, and Reddit.

V reported encouraging volume and transaction results for the quarter-to-date period, showing both booming e-commerce businesses and cross-border volume growth. This gives us a general idea about the industry’s current flow. The financial transaction juggernaut witnessed 7% year-over-year growth in U.S. payments volume last month.Payments VolumeCredit payments volume in the United States increased 5% in the quarter-to-date period while debit payments rose 6%. These growth percentages include a sequential rise in payments volume growth rate in August.While card not present volume increased 9% year over year in August, card present volume only climbed 4%. This can signify that e-commerce businesses are still prospering, at least at a better degree than brick-and-mortar businesses.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. payments volume growth is pegged at 6.5%. The metric witnessed a 6% increase in the quarter-to-date period. Hence, V has a few miles left to cover in the third month.

195,a202879c-246e-33bc-8a92-6da808ca026f,APH,2023-09-02,Investors Shouldn't Overlook The Favourable Returns On Capital At Amphenol (NYSE:APH),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-shouldnt-overlook-favourable-returns-110027104.html,1693652427,STORY,['APH'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Amphenol (NYSE:APH), we liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Amphenol is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$15b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Amphenol has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Electronic industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amphenol compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Amphenol's ROCE Trending?It's hard not to be impressed by Amphenol's returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 21% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 75% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 21%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If Amphenol can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.What We Can Learn From Amphenol's ROCEIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 95% return if they held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

196,b569c8f8-de28-323d-a3c5-5e730817a8e3,MAR,2023-09-02,"Spending in tech, designer brands hasn't slowed: Market technician",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/spending-tech-designer-brands-hasnt-212133219.html,1693603293,VIDEO,"['^DJI', '^GSPC', '^NDX', '^IXIC', '^SPX', 'MAR', 'TSLA', 'LULU', 'NIO', 'NIOIF', 'ANF', 'ABNB', 'TJX', 'HLT']","[There are a lot of concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items. However, customers are still spending on technology and designer brands, says TheoTrade Chief Market Technician Jeff Bierman. Bierman says of companies like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) and Lululemon Atheletica (LULU) that ""people continue to spend"" on their products ""regardless of the actual rate hikes that have occurred."" However, Bierman warns that there could be a ""corrective mode"" if ""we cannot maintain jobs at a certain high level,"" given that savings have been depleted.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Kind of follow-up on what we were talking about at the top of the show, you know, how much of the market is actually reading some of the lag factors that could come in when you think about where the economy is headed, yes, we are starting to see the slowdown. Yes, the expectation is the fed is likely to hold rates going into year end. But there's still a lot of uncertainty about what current existing monetary policy will likely mean in the next several quarters. Do you think there's a bit of complacency that's kicked in?JEFF BIERMAN: No, I think there's a tremendous amount of complacency that's kicked in, Akiko. As a matter of fact, I call this the sweet charity market like from the 1967 film. And there's a song in there that says, hey, big spender.Now, I listen to your piece before where you said, hey, look, spending has come in a little bit on some of the high-ticket items like Tesla, some of the things like NIO. There's also been a sort of a slowdown in spending and travel in terms of airlines, in terms of lodging, things like Marriott, Hilton, Airbnb. They've all come in about 15% to 20%. And so I can see some of the big-ticket items have come in terms of travel services and what I call a status.But one thing has not slowed down, Akiko, is the spending in what I call technology or in designer brands whatsoever. You're looking at stocks-- TJ Maxx, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Lululemon-- these high status kind of companies, brand designers. They just never tick down. People continue to spend regardless of the actual rate hikes that have occurred.Story continuesI'm not sure exactly why. But at some point, consumers are going to have to look at their credit card balances and think to themselves, well, if I don't pay off at the end of the month, what might be the ramifications? And their balances are going to build.And the other side of this is, this is the lowest savings rate in the United States in over 40 years. We're down at about 2.5% to 3%. So everybody's pretty much tapped out on his or her credit cards. So although spending has been curbed in some areas, it's not being curbed in all areas.And with the low savings rate, to me, it spells some type of like corrective mode that's going to take place if we cannot maintain jobs at a certain high level. So expect the job number to slow down. Expect spending to slow down. It's just not being reflected in the market just yet. Give it time.SEANA SMITH: So Jeff, what could then be reflected when we talk about the chance of a possible correction? What does that correction look like?JEFF BIERMAN: I don't think it's going to be that serious of a correction, like, you know, just a demonizing thing. However, let me put this in perspective, Seana. This is the greatest bifurcation that I've ever seen in 35 years between value stocks and growth stocks. Portfolio managers are treating growth stocks literally like they're the ugly redheaded stepchild or cancer. They want to have nothing to do with it.As a matter of fact, the lower the growth the value stocks go, the higher the growth stocks go. The market is sending a message that we don't want value at any cost. We don't. We want growth at any cost.And if you were to ask me what the linchpin is that's going to get the market to turn on its heels and finally get that corrective mode, it's probably going to be somewhere between the mean reversion of the growth stocks coming down and value stocks coming back into favor. That's where I see the market start to do its kind of corrective mode.And I sent you a graphic that there are two sectors that carry the market this year. If you remove the-- there's 11 sectors in the S&amp;P. Technology, and consumer discretionary are responsible for the entire gain in the S&amp;P absent of those two sectors, the S&amp;P is actually down for the year.So at some point, the consumer discretionary sector, the XLY is going to have to make a move. And the XLY is made up of things, like I said, high end-- the Lululemons, the Nikes, the Abercrombie &amp; Fitches. Those things are going to have to correct at some point. And value at some point will come back into play.For some apparent reason, dividends have no interest to portfolio managers. I'm not sure why.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah.JEFF BIERMAN: But in a corrective mode, that would seem to place to park your money.AKIKO FUJITA: So Jeff, is all of that to say that you see opportunity in value right now and that's where maybe investors should be looking?JEFF BIERMAN: Oh, my goodness, do I see opportunity? I-- some of the-- I-- they've been shunning utilities all year long. Nobody wants to touch utility because interest rates have been rising. But the fact of the matter, AT&amp;T and Verizon actually offer tremendous yields. Their cash flow is steady. And if the market does go into a corrective phase, this could be a place to park your money to get a lot of upside as well as a very kind of juicy dividend.My other two areas is they've been shunning, except for Eli Lilly, Akiko-- all year long, all year, nobody wants to buy-- have anything to do with pharma. Pfizer, thrown, kicked to the curb. Bristol-Myers, kicked to the curb. Those are the places where the greatest value opportunities are because they're at single-digit PEs and yields that go from 3% to 6%.So I think that if the recession siren is sounded, you're going to find great value in pharma and in utilities. And that money will actually come out of the XLY and come out of the XLK because it's just been overcooked for too long.SEANA SMITH: So some opportunity in some of those recent beaten down plays. Jeff Bierman, always great to get your perspective. Thanks. Have a good weekend.JEFF BIERMAN: Thank you, Seana. Have a nice day.]"
197,9ead0dca-a534-3d56-8c2f-7865fbd1ca42,MAR,2023-09-02,Marriott (MAR) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-mar-upgraded-strong-buy-160006943.html,1693584006,STORY,['MAR'],"[Investors might want to bet on Marriott International (MAR), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Marriott basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Marriott imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for MarriottFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this hotel company is expected to earn $8.63 per share, which is a change of 29% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Marriott. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Marriott to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: New Street upgraded MercadoLibre (MELI) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $1,650, up from $1,400. The analyst says the company remains a ""uniquely well positioned asset"" across e-commerce. MercadoLibre's market share gains in Brazil, its core market, have been material in the last 12 months and there is more to come with domestic players struggling to compete, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says talk of Chinese vendor competition is likely overdone.DA Davidson upgraded AppFolio (APPF) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $230, up from $155. The firm transitioned coverage to a new analyst with the upgrade. AppFolio holds a competitive advantage in the user-friendliness of its software and has multiple growth drivers from both expansion among existing clients and market penetration, the analyst tells investors in a research note.Citi upgraded Aramark (ARMK) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $45. With the stock down 6% in the last month, Aramark's valuation is attractive and the upcoming Uniforms spinoff event is a potentially positive catalyst, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Although execution risk remains in the context of the Uniforms separation and the ""impressive rate"" of new contract growth acting as a near-term margin drag, offsetting this is that the inflationary environment seems on the cusp of inflecting into favorable territory for Aramark, contends Citi.Guggenheim upgraded Eos Energy (EOSE) to Buy from Neutral with a $10 price target following yesterday's news that the Department of Energy has provided a $400M conditional loan commitment to the company. The ""long-awaited"" announcement marks the end of a lengthy technical and due diligence process and the loan guarantee should underpin an expansion to 8GWh in annual production capacity by mid-2026, the analyst tells investors. The firm's price target reflects its updated revenue and EBITDA outlook for 2025, arguing that the conditional commitment is significant as it signals that Eos has passed the LPO's due diligence process.Wedbush upgraded Papa John's (PZZA) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $95, up from $80. The firm's checks point to North America same-store sales growth trending above consensus in Q3 and beyond the quarter the firm views Papa's forward domestic same-store sales growth expectations as ""realistic,"" the analyst tells investors. The margin trajectory could deliver operating margins ahead of current expectations and the firm is ""not overly concerned"" about Papa's medium- to longer-term unit growth trajectory, the analyst added.Story continuesTop 5 Downgrades: Telsey Advisory downgraded Dollar General (DG) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $145, down from $185. The analyst is ""disappointed"" by the Q2 results, which the firm says reflected soft sales, poor execution, and ongoing investments. Telsey cites Dollar General's softer comp and profit outlook for the second half of 2023, which it believes is likely to continue into 2024, for the downgrade. Meanwhile, Loop Capital also downgraded Dollar General to Hold from Buy with a price target of $140, down from $200. The company ""continued a troubling recent trend"" in Q2 with the company's second ""miss and lower"" print of fiscal 2023, the analyst tells investors in a research note. In addition, Evercore ISI downgraded Dollar General to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $150, down from $185, and Raymond James downgraded Dollar General to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $160, down from $200, following the Q2 report.Argus downgraded British American Tobacco (BTI) to Hold from Buy with no price target. While the management expects global tobacco volume to be down 2% in 2024, the stock has outperformed relative to the broader index and the Consumer Staples ETF (IYK) over the past three months, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm adds that it would consider returning British American Tobacco to the Buy list on signs of stronger sustained earnings growth from new categories.Baird downgraded PagerDuty (PD) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $25, down from $32. The company reported mixed Q2 results, with a revenue and earnings beat while billings were below guidance, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The revenue beat was not passed though and Q3 billings were guided weaker, says the firm. Baird cites the company's slower implied second half of fiscal 2024 growth and tougher first half of fiscal 2025 compares likely limiting upside for the downgrade.B. Riley downgraded Hersha Hospitality Trust (HT) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $10, up from $9, after the company agreed to be acquired and taken private by KSL Partners for $10 per share in cash.Northland downgraded Allot Ltd. (ALLT) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $3, down from $8. Despite an in-line topline report for Q2, Allot is lowering the midpoint calendar 2023 revenue guidance and the second half guidance indicates that DPI's ""cash cow status has become questionable,"" the analyst tells investors. Verizon (VZ) SMB uptake as a catalyst to SECaaS ARR acceleration ""remains possible,"" but looks ""highly uncertain,"" the analyst added.Top 5 Initiations:Canaccord initiated coverage of Confluent (CFLT) with a Buy rating and $40 price target. In a rapidly growing, highly fragmented data streaming landscape, Confluent ""stands out"" with its Apache Kafka, a ""ubiquitous open-source event streaming technology,"" the analyst tells investors. The vast majority of data streams in Confluent Cloud are linked downstream to some form of application code processing or reacting to that stream of data and the opportunity in stream processing with Flink ""could be as large"" as the core market, the analyst added.Needham initiated coverage of Veeco (VECO) with a Buy rating and $35 price target. The company's turnaround efforts are succeeding and the long-term growth driven by the adoption of Veeco's unique technologies such as laser anneal, ion beam deposition and advanced packaging lithography is transforming the company, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Investors should take a ""fresh look"" at Veeco shares as the company will look very different as its strategic turnaround progresses, the firm added.Raymond James initiated coverage of Ferguson (FERG) with an Outperform rating and $175 price target. Ferguson is a well positioned industrial distributor, with leading market positioning and scale advantages across ""fragmented, complementary, and growing industries,"" the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes the company's out-year growth will be supported by secular tailwinds and consistent demonstrated market outgrowth.Loop Capital initiated coverage of Builders FirstSource (BLDR) with a Buy rating and $180 price target. The company has a number of catalysts that support a ""sustainable valuation re-rating moving forward,"" the analyst tells investors in a research note. Builders FirstSource' recent improvement in single-family housing starts will be a meaningful demand tailwind into 2024 and more than offset any moderation in multi-family construction next year, says the firm.BTIG initiated coverage of P3 Health Partners (PIII) with a Buy rating and $5 price target. P3 is a value-based-care organization that focuses exclusively on the Medicare Advantage space, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes the company is better positioned than some others because expectations for EBITDA are low and the P3 was already EBITDA-positive in Q2. In addition, since the company focuses exclusively on Medicare, and not Medicaid, its margin potential is much higher than some peers, contends BTIG.]"

(NYSE:TPR) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A US$0.35 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tapestry-inc-nyse-tpr-passed-121341597.html,1693656821,STORY,['TPR'],"[It looks like Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Tapestry's shares before the 7th of September to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.35 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.20 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Tapestry stock has a trailing yield of around 4.2% on the current share price of $33.7. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Tapestry can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Tapestry Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Tapestry paid out a comfortable 30% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 36% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Tapestry has grown its earnings rapidly, up 24% a year for the past five years. Tapestry is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Tapestry has delivered 1.6% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Tapestry? Tapestry has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.While it's tempting to invest in Tapestry for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Tapestry and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

This allows a company to operate on a greater scale which can increase profitability in correlation with economies of scale.Typically for stocks, large-cap companies are valued at $10 billion or higher and tend to have the greatest trading liquidity. Higher trading liquidity allows large-cap stocks to be traded on the stock market quickly, without having a significant effect on their price.Furthermore, market cap allows investors to compare the size, growth potential, income, and risk of different companies.Let’s take a look at a few surging stocks that may be able to keep taking market share and boost investors' portfolios.Technology Leaders with a Large Market Share With this year’s surge in tech stocks, there are a number of companies that are retaining or growing their hefty valuations.It's hard to not have this conversation without mentioning Apple AAPL or Nvidia NVDA with a market cap of roughly $3 trillion and $1.2 trillion respectively.Apple is the highest-valued company on U.S. stock exchanges with Nvidia the fifth largest and continuing to take market share among chipmakers. Nvidia’s market cap is now 122% above the Zacks Semiconductor-General Markets' $54.82 billion average which alludes to why NVDA shares have kept climbing over the years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has soared +223% this year. More astonishing, NVDA shares are now up 12,000% over the last decade and this somewhat unending stellar performance could continue with Nvidia’s chips powering the AI revolution.As for Apple, its stock has climbed +43% this year and currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Of course, Apple can only fall out of the top spot in terms of market cap but the company’s $48 billion cash pile is indicative of the benefits of taking market share. Furthermore, with a pipeline of famous tech products Apple stock is up +963% in the last 10 years and is usually a viable option for longer-term investors.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA Retail Company Poised to Take Market-CapLooking at smaller companies that may be on their way to taking market share or eventually achieving large-cap status is always beneficial. This could correlate with lofty stock market gains and Urban Outfitters URBN stands out in this regard.With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Urban Outfitters is a popular fashion retailer that caters its apparel and merchandise to younger generations. Urban Outfitters has shown signs of taking market cap in the past hitting a peak of $6.25 billion back in 2018.While Urban Outfitters' market cap is currently at $3 billion, we can see from the chart below that this is now on par with its Zacks industry further suggesting the company is a sound investment in the space and may have a chance at being a disrupter (and has already been so).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlus, Urban Outfitters' steady growth is reason to believe it might be taking real market share along the way. Urban Outfitters' stock has climbed +39% YTD as earnings are forecasted to pop 82% in its current fiscal 2024 to $3.18 a share compared to $1.75 per share a year ago.More importantly to seeing continued brand growth, sales are expected to be up 6% in FY24 and rise another 4% in FY25 to $5.30 billion. Better still, FY25 sales projections would represent 55% growth over the last five years with FY21 sales at $3.45 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTaking market share puts companies in a position to offer shareholders unprecedented returns in regard to their stocks. This makes keeping an eye on a stock's market cap beneficial to investors as well. To that point, Apple, Nvidia, and Urban Outfitters are three stocks to watch.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The talks are ongoing and some other potential investors are also in discussions to invest in the IPO, the sources added.SoftBank Group Corp, which owns Britain-based Arm, is targeting a valuation between $50 billion and $55 billion, Reuters reported earlier on Friday. Arm's clients have agreed to invest in that valuation range, the sources said.While it is possible that demand for Arm's shares will lead to a higher valuation by the time the IPO prices, the move represents a climb-down from the $64 billion valuation at which SoftBank acquired the 25% stake in the company it did not already own from its $100 billion Vision Fund last month.Apple, Nvidia and the other strategic investors have agreed to invest between $25 million and $100 million each in the blockbuster IPO, the sources said. Arm and SoftBank have set aside 10% of the shares to be sold in the IPO for its clients, Reuters has previously reported.Amazon.com Inc, which had previously held talks to invest in the IPO, has decided not to participate, one of the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential.A scramble among Arm's clients, comprising the world's biggest technology companies, to snap up shares in the IPO is testing the semiconductor designer's adherence to not picking sides in the chip industry.The interest is fueled by a desire by companies to expand their commercial relationship with Arm and make sure rivals do not gain an edge, Reuters has previously reported.While an investment in the IPO would not come with a seat on Arm's board or ability to dictate strategy, it could strengthen ties with each participating company and make it harder for a competitor to acquire Arm later.Story continuesArm and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.AMD, Intel, Synopsys and Nvidia declined to comment.

Here's What to Expect In September,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buying-opportunities-abound-heres-expect-164500469.html,1693586700,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'NVDA']","[Stocks kicked off the first trading day of September on Friday in mixed fashion, as the major indexes staggered between slight gains and losses in the early going.Markets initially popped this morning following the release of the August nonfarm payrolls report, which presented a surprise jump in U.S. unemployment. The U.S. economy created 187,000 jobs in August, ahead of the 170,000 forecast, while the unemployment rate rose to 3.8% versus the 3.5% median expectation.The data came after yesterday’s release of the July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index figure, which showed that year-over-year core PCE – the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge – increased 4.2%, the first time since January that the measure picked up.Despite both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 breaking 5-month winning streaks in August, the bullish tech theme appears to have returned as the Nasdaq has managed to rise in each of the past 5 sessions, regaining key technical levels in the process. While volume has been fairly anemic during any rally attempts over the past month, the tech-heavy index has been driven higher by strong performance from several of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks, including Nvidia NVDA and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.Nvidia is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, while Alphabet is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Both companies have been outperforming this year and are part of leading industries.A late-month rally helped to pare some of the losses in August, with both NVDA and GOOGL closing near 52-week highs (and all-time highs in the case of Nvidia). Here’s what to expect in September as we head into the fall season.September Brings More Weak SeasonalityThe August-September timeframe is the weakest two-month stretch of the year from a historical perspective. Below is the data that backs this up; the graph shows the average S&amp;P 500 performance by month dating back to 1950. As we can see, September is historically the worst month with a -0.7% average return.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the Nasdaq paring August losses and rising in five consecutive sessions, it’s easy to get caught up in the fact that momentum appears to have come back. But even in the most bullish of times, it’s never a straight line up. And in the seasonally weak period of August and September, we need to be realistic about potential returns.Unfortunately, even in strong pre-election years such as this one, September gets no respite from the normal selling pressure despite the positive underlying forces. The S&amp;P 500 has averaged a -0.8% decline in pre-election years dating back to 1950. The Nasdaq has also averaged a -0.8% drop dating back to 1971.Buying Opportunity Ahead?Even though we are in the midst of a weak seasonal period, we need to keep the broader picture top of mind. The weight of the evidence that we have in hand at this point suggests a high probability that a new bull market is underway. This gives rise to the idea that this recent weakness in the market will be a ‘buyable’ pullback.Let’s also keep in mind that while the historical statistics presented above are certainly useful, markets are dynamic and have a way of surprising the majority of investors. A September rally is something that very few are expecting, and therefore we need to respect the possibility.In fact, dating back to 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 is up 10% or more year-to-date and experiences a negative August, the month of September has been higher 8 out of 10 times with a 2.6% median return. Not too shabby for the normally weak seasonal period, simply telling us to keep an open mind about a wide variety of potential outcomes.Final ThoughtsA weak period from a seasonal perspective certainly warrants caution. But the stock market tends to surprise the masses, and with nearly everyone expecting more downside in the normally dreary month of September, we should be open to the idea of higher stock prices.Growth stocks like NVDA and GOOGL have led the way this year, but other pockets of the market have shown strength as well. Homebuilders have been a bright spot outside of tech, while manufacturing stocks have also shown momentum.Make sure you’re taking advantage of all that Zacks has to offer as we make our way into September.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Within the segment, net sales of medicated feed additives (MFAs) and others reflected 2% year-over-year growth. The uptick was driven by increased demand for the company’s processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry.Within Animal Health, nutritional specialty product sales rose 5%, primarily on higher average selling prices and an increase in microbial products.Also, net vaccine sales showed a year-over-year rise of 25% on an increase in domestic and international demand, along with new product launches in Latin America.Our model projected a 2.2% year-over-year rise in Animal Health business in the fiscal fourth quarter.Net sales in the Mineral Nutrition segment fell 16% year over year to $58.4 million due to a decline in the demand for trace minerals, partially offset by higher average selling prices.We expected this business to decline 1% on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter.Net sales in the Performance Products segment rose 3% to $19.9 million, increased demand and higher average selling prices for copper-related products.Story continuesOur model projected a 0.2% year-over-year rise in the Performance Products business in the fiscal fourth quarter.MarginsPhibro’s fiscal fourth-quarter gross profit fell 2.4% year over year to $76.6 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.32.Our TakePhibro exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 on a disappointing note with lower-than-expected revenues and earnings miss. However, robust performance across the Animal Health segment is encouraging. The business registered increased demand for MFAs, particularly in the U.S. and Latin American regions, coupled with strong demand for processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry. Expansion of operating margin is encouraging too.On the flip side, the Mineral Nutrition Products segment reported a year-over-year decline due to a decline in the demand for trace minerals.

(NYSE:TRV) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-travelers-companies-121009571.html,1693656609,STORY,['TRV'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Travelers Companies' shares before the 7th of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.00 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.00 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Travelers Companies has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current share price of $162.3. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Travelers Companies Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Travelers Companies's payout ratio is modest, at just 40% of profit.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see Travelers Companies earnings per share are up 5.6% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Travelers Companies has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.1% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Travelers Companies an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. In summary, Travelers Companies appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while Travelers Companies has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Travelers Companies and understanding them should be part of your investment process.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Genuine Parts' shares before the 7th of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.95 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.80 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Genuine Parts has a trailing yield of approximately 2.5% on its current stock price of $155.08. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Genuine Parts's payout ratio is modest, at just 43% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 69% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Genuine Parts's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Genuine Parts's earnings per share have risen 16% per annum over the last five years. Genuine Parts has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Genuine Parts has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.7% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Genuine Parts for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Genuine Parts paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Genuine Parts looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Genuine Parts that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Spectrum is the second largest U.S. cable provider, serving 14.7 million homes across large markets such as New York and Los Angeles.The dispute soured investor sentiment on the sector, which has also been grappling with the Hollywood writers and actors strike over wages and other issues which have raised doubts about whether companies will have enough content in coming months.Shares of Disney dropped 2.65% to a three-year low while Charter lost 3.4%. Warner Brothers Discovery Inc fell 10%, Fox Corp shed 6%, Paramount Global dropped 8%, while Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, was down nearly 3%.""The drop in Disney this morning looks to be tied to the company's ongoing contract negotiations with Charter Communications,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. ""Another source of concern sits with the ongoing strikes with both actors and writers in Hollywood.""Charter said Disney rejected its proposal for a new distribution deal that takes into account the rise of competing low-cost streaming services, which has fueled cord-cutting among its customers. The cable provider said it pays Disney $2.2 billion in annual programming costs, excluding advertising.""Disney - so far - has insisted on a traditional long-term deal with higher rates and limited packaging flexibility,"" Charter said in a presentation published on Friday.Disney said on Thursday it has reached successful deals with pay TV providers across the country and that the rates and terms it sought with Charter ""are driven by the marketplace.""""This Charter-Disney deal not going through here has spooked a little bit of the market, at least that sector,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst at Triple D Trading.(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Amruta Khandeka and Khushi Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Michelle Price and Richard Chang)]"

But is the stock modestly undervalued? Let's delve into a thorough valuation analysis to find out.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with FOXA. Click here to check it out. FOXA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FOXAFox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) is a media conglomerate, holding assets not sold to Disney by its predecessor, Twenty First Century Fox, in 2019. Its portfolio includes Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, and 28 owned and operated local television stations. Since the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other assets, including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, banking on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market. With a current stock price of $31.69, Fox's market cap stands at $14.90 billion. But how does this compare with its GF Value, an estimation of fair value?Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideSummarizing the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GF Value, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) appears to be modestly undervalued. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. Given Fox's current price of $31.69 per share and a market cap of $14.90 billion, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Fox's Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to check its financial strength. Investing in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a higher risk of permanent loss. Key indicators such as the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide insights into a company's financial strength. Fox has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.52, which is worse than 62.91% of 1003 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. The overall financial strength of Fox is 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial health.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies typically carries less risk, especially if the company has demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins usually offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Fox has been profitable 8 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $14.90 billion and an EPS of $2.32. Its operating margin of 18.53% is better than 88.43% of 1020 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Fox's profitability as strong.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term stock performance of a company. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Fox is 12%, ranking better than 79.54% of 958 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 11.5%, ranking better than 60.94% of 768 companies in the Media - Diversified industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Fox's ROIC was 12.23, while its WACC came in at 5.99.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 60.94% of 768 companies in the Media - Diversified industry.

ABC-TV was also cut in seven markets, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.Both the cable company and Disney said the other side rejected short-term extensions that would have kept Spectrum subscribers' access to the networks.Disputes that result in such service disruptions are not uncommon. This one feels bigger, both because of the number of networks and customers involved and how the companies are grappling with a rapidly changing business environment.The plug was pulled Thursday while ESPN was carrying a college football game between Florida and No. 14 Utah, and ESPN2 was showing the U.S. Open, including the second-round match between top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz and Lloyd Harris. Charter Spectrum has 14.7 million cable customers.Chris Winfrey, CEO of Charter Communications, said he recognized the timing was not ideal for customers.“We've almost always avoided these kinds of disputes and disruption to your service,” Winfrey said, addressing customers in a conference call Friday. “But we had to draw a line in the sand in your behalf.”These disputes typically involve how much money a cable system is required to pay a company like Disney for carrying its stations. ESPN traditionally has had the highest carriage fees for cable companies. According to S&amp;P Global, Disney gets an average of $2.2 billion per year from being carried on Spectrum under its 2019 carriage deal.Between cord-cutting and the increased popularity of streaming, Charter says it has lost 25% of its cable customers over the past five years. So it is seeking a deal with more flexibility: allowing customers to order some Disney-owned stations without being forced to take all of them, and it wants ad-supported streaming services included so customers don't have to essentially pay for them twice.Story continuesBut Disney said Friday that its streaming and television products are not the same.“Although Charter claims to value our direct-to-consumer services, they are demanding these services for free,” Disney said in a statement. The company said it makes multibillion-dollar investments in exclusive content for those streaming apps.Other cities where Charter is the major cable carrier include Dallas/Fort Worth; Orlando, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis; Cleveland; Cincinnati; Milwaukee; and Las Vegas.Disney said it was ready to resume negotiations as quickly as possible.]"

Recently, media mogul Barry Diller warned of consequences for studios if they continue partnering with streaming companies like Netflix (NFLX). MNTN CEO Mark Douglas joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the comments.“If you look at the economics on it, I’m not sure how that quite works,” Douglas says. Douglas notes that Disney (DIS) “did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year,” whereas Netflix (NFLX) did “three times that, just by themselves. So they’re the size of like a couple of major studios combined, so I don’t know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out.”“Whenever these studios are in trouble, it’s like the finance team takes over and it just doesn’t make sense,” Douglas says. “These studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference,” Douglas discusses.Douglas also notes that this is “not new. All this talk was on DVDs,” 20, 30 years ago as well. “Every time there’s a new technology, it’s like everyone’s up in arms over it. And so, bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and... we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry in a healthy state,” Douglas adds.Video Transcript- Well, key issues between Hollywood writers and studios still linger as the strike heads into its fifth month. But media mogul Barry Diller warning of catastrophic consequences should Hollywood studios continue to partner with streaming giants like Netflix, even calling it the architect of the strike on Kara Swisher's podcast. So who's poised to take on Netflix as the strike continues. Mark Douglas, MNTN CEO, joins us now. Mark, great to have you here with us in studio.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.- I mean, these comments are sending shockwaves right now through the equity price action of some of the largest streamers and some of them former linear powerhouses in television as well. I mean, what do you make of the comments here and could we really see some type of new negotiation process where the different studios are trying to keep Netflix out of the conversation.Story continuesMARK DOUGLAS: Well, if you look at the economics on it, I'm not sure how that quite works. So like look at Disney, for example. They did about $10 billion in studio revenue last year. Netflix is three times that just by themselves. So the size of like a couple of major studios combined. So I don't know how you take an industry that seems to be largely striking over streaming and try to separate it out, and that's like the writers and the actors that kind think that makes sense.I think the other thing you see from the comments is that whenever these studios are in trouble, it's like the finance team takes over and it just doesn't make sense. I was talking to a friend last night, I was like if we were in a restaurant, like if this restaurant had like fewer people in it, you don't call your accountant.- No.MARK DOUGLAS: You call the chef. So I think these studios have to meet consumers where they are. The consumer sees no difference. Like ""Oppenheimer,"" three hours, I want to see it at home, I don't want to go in the theater, I'm actually willing to pay more. This is also not new. All this talk was on DVDs, you know, what, 20, 30 years ago. Every time there's a new technology, it's like everyone's up in arms over it. And so bottom line, focus on the consumer, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained and the industry and the healthy state.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Mark, Rachelle here.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.RACHELLE AKUFFO: As we look at Netflix, obviously holding the crown here, but then when you think of who is the next best contender, because Amazon has an interesting market there because it's usually people subscribing for Amazon not necessarily for the streaming content, it's because they've already got it for the shopping or something else. Who would be the next closest contender to a Netflix?MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I think a lot of people are thinking maybe Apple, mainly because Apple has essentially the dollars to lead a consolidation. I'm not sure that it actually makes sense for Apple because Apple's more focused on a bundle.Remember, Apple not only has Apple TV, they have Apple Music, Apple News, Apple games. And so what Apple wants is they want $20 a month from every iPhone user in the world. And they don't have to create content for music, they don't have to create content for games or for news, but they are clearly positioned, if there's going to be a consolidation, they are the ones that can lead it. Whether that makes sense for Apple as a company I'm not so sure. But they're in the best next position.I agree with you. I don't think Amazon-- that there's a lot of reasons there for Amazon to lead a consolidation of a bunch of these studios- You were talking about ""Oppenheimer"" a moment ago.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.- That's a film that was already in the can, promotion had already been done.MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.- So by when now do many of the talks for strikes and negotiations need to be netted out by.MARK DOUGLAS: So until the actors strike, you could still film, even though the writers were on strike. And so I think when the actors went on strike, that literally has shut things down. I mean, if you look back on COVID, I mean, they went quite a while without new content and still were able to survive that. So you're looking I think Q1 and Q2 before like consumers are affected in terms of they can't get the content they want.And there are a lot of big shows out now. You have ""Billions"" out. You have new seasons on all these streamers. So I think the fall and the winter is taken care of. By the summer-- by the spring-- I mean, I'm sorry, by the early next year it's really going to start to affect the funnel of content that comes out and it's going to start to become a big problem.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Mark, who do you think is most at risk in terms of losing brand loyalty. Obviously you've got consumers trying to pinch some pennies here, there might be one or two streaming services that they're going to hold on to. But then manufacturing things like live sports coming into the mix, who do you think is going to have the best brand loyalty out of the streamers.MARK DOUGLAS: Well, it's always Netflix without a doubt. The reason why is Netflix is where you go when you're not looking for your favorite show. Like I think most people I know and I'd say this for myself, when I turn on my TV, the first thing I do is see what's on Netflix. So they're positioned very well. Second thing I want is sports content, which comes from like Hulu, YouTube, TV.In the third slot, I think Disney. Everyone thought they had that locked up with Disney. Plus, but Disney has stumbled quite a bit. Their ""Star Wars"" content is lagging. So I think it's kind of a toss up. And a lot of people, their behavior is, well, I'll binge on Disney for three months, then I'll binge on Showtime for three months. I'll binge on Max. And so that third slot I think is the really where a lot of the competition is.The first slot, I mean, Netflix just has it on lock. They have muscle memory. Meaning you turn on your TV and you just go for Netflix. And so I think that's going to be hard for anyone to overcome.- Well, for a lot of sports fans out there, they tend to have the second spot that they go to where their team is playing. And I mean, as we're beginning NFL season. Of course, there's a different type of football that's capturing attention, there's Messi now playing in the MLS, and Apple has those rights for broadcasting and for streaming. So is the Messi effect taking hold? Is that as effective as Apple was hoping and intended it to be in this battle for some of these streaming rights for sports right now?MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, so the way I think to always think of Apple is they don't want the fee for Apple Plus, they want the fee for the Apple bundle. So they're always going to try to put in enough content that you'll just go for the whole bundle. Basically you'll switch from Spotify to Apple Music, if you're a Spotify user.And so I think they've gone after sports, Messi made a lot of sense for them. He's like taken over-- I live in Miami. He's taken over. You see you see posters for him everywhere in Miami. So people really love that. But I don't think you'll see Apple like kind of keep going further, because their bar is to stay on track for that 19.99 a month bundle for all the services. And everyone has to remember, for three of those, they have no production costs whatsoever, right? They're just streaming music, they're not making the music. So it's particularly profitable for them.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as a football fan, if I was going to sign up for that Apple streaming service, it would be maybe just to watch Messi play, but chances are afterwards, I probably wouldn't use the service anymore. I probably would disconnect it. But I do want to ask you, in terms of losing magic, I have to ask you about Disney Plus and how do you see their streaming strength going forward?MARK DOUGLAS: Well, I mean, they have the assets, the question is, is do they want to invest in them. I mean, they've kind of actually said they're de-emphasizing ""Star Wars"" a bit. Obviously they have Marvel Studios. I think Disney as a company has a lot of strength. They have all the sports I mean, if you own ESPN, I mean, to some extent you almost own sports. They have all the children's programming, family programming. And for some reason, they just seem to not be able to bundle it together in a way that they keep growing the subscribers. I think they'll figure it out. Bob Iger is obviously, a strong leader.And Disney, if you look at their revenue, it's gone up consistently over the last 10 years. Its profitability where they've stumbled. In 2019, they were doing something like $12 billion in profits, and now they're doing three, even though their revenue is higher. So I think for Disney, it's like do 10% more with 10% less. Fix the profits and just keep giving consumers what they want. That's the bottom line.- We got to go. If there's one name that you think wins out the advertising play here now with all these streaming services adding in that tier, who is it?MARK DOUGLAS: I think over the long term, it's definitely Netflix, but in the short term, I think NBC is actually a lot stronger than most people give them credit for.- All right.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, thanks so much. Mark Douglas there, MNTN CEO. Thank you for joining us this morning.]"

GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded.

To avoid permanent capital loss, an investor must do their research and review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are a great way to understand its financial strength. Devon Energy has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.07, which ranks worse than 83.37% of 1022 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The overall financial strength of Devon Energy is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Devon Energy is fair.Devon Energy (DVN): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthIt poses less risk to invest in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Devon Energy has been profitable 5 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $17 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $7.31. Its operating margin is 37.06%, which ranks better than 79.32% of 967 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Devon Energy at 6 out of 10, which indicates fair profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Devon Energy is 23.7%, which ranks better than 76.29% of 852 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 56.9%, which ranks better than 86.42% of 825 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Devon Energy's return on invested capital is 24.3, and its cost of capital is 11.2.Devon Energy (DVN): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) shows every sign of being fairly valued.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 4/102. Profitability rank: 10/103. Growth rank: 10/104. GF Value rank: 5/105.

The decline was due to the market price adjustments in the Residential segment, project delays in the Renewables and Agtech segments concerning solar module availability, project permitting, and project rescoping as well as continuous channel inventory right-sizing. These headwinds were partially offset by organic growth in the Residential and Infrastructure segments and the acquisition of Quality Aluminum Products. On an adjusted basis, the top line remained flat year over year at $364.1 million.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRenewable Energy: Net sales in the segment decreased 23.6% from the year-ago quarter to $77.5 million wherein our model expected the segmental net sales to decline 10.1% to $91.3 million year over year. The solar module supply and delay in local permits affected project timing of contracted as well as active projects. Nonetheless, there are continuous improvements in module supply as additional module importers are coming up with the importation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act learning curve. The order backlog was up 16.7% sequentially and 6.3% year over year.The adjusted operating margin of 11.7% expanded 470 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by efficient execution across the business. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased 550 bps from the prior-year quarter to 14.8%.Residential Products: Net sales in the segment were up 14% year over year to $228.2 million. This segment’s reported figure is up from our prediction of $196.6 million, which suggested a 1.8% decline from the prior year.  Organic sales growth and the acquisition of Quality Aluminum Products or QAP backed the uptrend, offsetting the year-over-year impact of market price adjustments made in prior quarters. QAP contributed 12.7% and organic sales contributed 1.3% to net sales growth.The adjusted operating margin of 19.3% expanded 80 bps in the quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased 90 bps from the prior-year quarter to 20.5%.Agtech: Sales declined 19.9% year over year to $35 million and adjusted sales fell 16.1% to $34.3 million. For this segment, we expected net sales as well as the adjusted sales to decline year over year by 3.9% to $42 million and by 2.7% to $39.8 million, respectively. The model’s value suggested higher sales value compared to the reported value. The downside was due to customer delays in project starts in the commercial business.

The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 350 bps year over year to 12.9%.Infrastructure: Sales in the segment rose 12.6% year over year to $24.2 million compared to the model’s prediction of $22.2 million, which indicated a 3.3% year-over-year increase.

246,bcd290d5-1dd3-3c80-a531-fc391ffa61b3,MCD,2023-09-02,Is McDonald's (MCD) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-mcd-buy-wall-street-133005629.html,1693575005,STORY,['MCD'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about McDonald's (MCD).McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.66, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.66 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.7% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying McDonald's, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MCD Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $11.49.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 5.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TripAdvisor due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.TripAdvisor Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues Beat EstimatesTripAdvisor reported non-GAAP second-quarter 2023 earnings of 34 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. The bottom line was down 8% year over year.Revenues of $494 million surged 18% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $474 million.Top-line growth was driven by growing demand for travel industry-related services. Further, strong momentum across Viator contributed well to the top line.Further, a well-performing TheFork segment benefited the company.Quarterly DetailsTripAdvisor reports revenues under three segments: Tripadvisor Core, Viator and TheFork.Tripadvisor Core: Revenues summed $279 million (accounting for 56.5% of revenues), up 2% year over year. The figure came below the consensus mark of $286 million. Tripadvisor-branded display and platform revenues jumped 14% year over year to $42 million. Revenues from Tripadvisor experiences and dining were $50 million, increasing by 43% year over year.However, revenues from Tripadvisor-branded hotels decreased 7% from the prior-year quarter’s level to $174 million. Other revenues consisting of rentals, flights, cars and cruise revenues were $13 million, down 7% year over year.Viator: Revenues totaled $216 million (43.7% of the top line). The figure was up 59% from the year-ago quarter’s level. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $180 million.TheFork: Revenues came in at $38 million (7.7% of revenues), increasing 19% year over year. The figure lagged the consensus mark of $38.3 million.Story continuesOperating ResultsTripAdvisor’s selling and marketing costs increased 24% year over year to $270 million.General and administrative costs were up 68% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $47 million. Technology and content costs of $71 million increased 34% on a year-over-year basis.TRIP reported an operating margin that contracted 620 basis points (bps) year over year to 8.9% in the second quarter.In the reported quarter, the total adjusted EBITDA margin was 18%, which contracted 810 bps on a year-over-year basis.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $1.14 billion compared with $1.13 billion as of Mar 31, 2023.Long-term debt stood at $838 million at the end of the second quarter compared with $837 million at the end of the previous quarter.Cash generated from operations was $105 million in the reported quarter, down from $135 million in the prior quarter.Additionally, free cash flow was $90 million in the second quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -25.23% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, TripAdvisor has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, TripAdvisor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerTripAdvisor is part of the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. Over the past month, eBay (EBAY), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2.7%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2023 more than a month ago.eBay reported revenues of $2.54 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%.

The industry is set to benefit from strong consumer demand and improved inventory levels, rising incentives and the surging popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). Capitalizing on favorable market trends, domestic automakers are enjoying robust recovery and growth as they overcome pandemic-related challenges. Investors can ride the industry’s strength with stocks like General Motors GM and PACCAR PCAR to fetch handsome gains.About the IndustryThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesDemand Remains Strong Despite High Borrowing Costs:  At the outset of 2023, industry experts anticipated a potential deceleration in the U.S. car market amid the increased cost of vehicle financing. However, consumer demand demonstrated greater resilience than anticipated. New vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, implying year-over-year and sequential growth of roughly 15% and 13%, respectively. Over the first six months, the market achieved sales of approximately 7.69 million units, reflecting a 12.3% increase from the same period in 2022. The demand for automobiles remains strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates has not yet significantly affected purchasing decisions. Quoting Cox Automotive's chief economist Jonathan Smoke, ""Consumers have found a way to buy new wheels.” Although the Fed has indicated the possibility of more rate hikes in the near future, the U.S. vehicle sales outlook for 2023 remains strong. Cox Automotive forecasts full-year vehicle sales at around 15 million units, up from 13.9 million units in 2022.Story continuesImproving Inventory Levels: Supply constraints have been considerably alleviated. Limited new-vehicle inventory over the past two years that had handcuffed sales is no longer a pressing concern. According to Cox Automotive, new vehicle inventory levels in the United States saw a significant increase of more than 70% in July compared to the same period last year. This increase in inventory availability bodes well for the industry, signaling a potential shift toward a more balanced state between supply and demand. Robust inventories are leading to richer incentives and sweeter discount deals. Incentives increased for the 10th straight month in July to the highest level since October 2021. All these factors are driving the prospects of the industry.Soaring EV Popularity: Heightened climate change concerns, advancements in technology, and strict fuel-emission regulations are resulting in the widespread adoption of eco-friendly vehicles. The demand for electric vehicles is on an upward trajectory, consistently setting new sales records. Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States. Additionally, 2023 is poised to be a landmark year, with U.S. EV sales projected to surpass 1 million units for the first time. Established car manufacturers are putting in substantial efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. Further, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to provide a further boost to EV sales. With this ongoing momentum and the anticipated growth ahead, the U.S. auto industry's outlook in the EV market appears promising.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #72, which places it in the top 29% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 7% over the past six months.Before we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and sector over the past year. The industry has lost 14.2% against the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 15.1%. The sector has declined 7.1% over the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 17.49X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 13.46X and the sector’s 12.53X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 58.44X, as low as 8.78X and at a median of 18.54X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)2 Stocks to BuyGeneral Motors: One of the world’s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022. General Motors’ compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bodes well. The company’s hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line.  Encouragingly, this legacy U.S. automaker will have nine EV models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. Its superior liquidity profile also instills confidence. General Motors’ strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.GM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 9.25%. The consensus mark for GM’s 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 12 cents and 15 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 22.6%.Price &amp; Consensus: GMPACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising the XF, XG and XD models, is driving the firm’s revenues. Continued growth in aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine — bodes well. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR’s prospects. A solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind. PACCAR’s strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 19% and 48.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for PCAR’s 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 70 cents and 38 cents, respectively, over the past 60 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 15.2%.Price &amp; Consensus: PCARYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The move is aimed to reduce labor costs as the package delivery firm struggles with a decline in demand scenario. The weak freight market has hurt overall volumes.At present, UPS employs around 3,400 pilots. The company expects 167 pilots to accept this voluntary retirement offer.  The separation scheme is quite lucrative as it includes cash as well as healthcare-related benefits. This is, in fact, the first time since 2010 that UPS has decided to reduce employments of its pilots. In 2010, UPS had furloughed 109 pilots, per the report mentioned above.We remind investors that in August, while releasing second-quarter 2023 results, management trimmed its current-year revenue outlook. UPS now expects 2023 revenues to be around $93 billion (prior view: $97 billion). Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook.Due to these headwinds, UPS shares have declined 2.6% year to date compared with its industry’s 10.3% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like United Airlines UALand Air Transport Services ATSG.UAL and ATSG currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each.

If you want to skip our in-depth analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Companies to Work for in 2023.As we step into 2023, the adage ""people are a company's greatest asset"" has never rung truer. The competitive edge now hinges on more than just profit margins and market share; it rests firmly on a company's ability to foster an environment where innovation thrives, where diversity is celebrated, and where employees find not just a job, but a genuine sense of purpose. Let’s explore what are the current trends driving employment around the world.Employment Trends in 2023 and the Key Players Remote and hybrid work have become undeniable trends that are reshaping the modern workforce. In 2023, 12.7% of full-time employees already work remotely, and 28.2% have embraced a hybrid work model that indicates the rapid evolution of work environments. Looking ahead, it's predicted that by 2025, about 32.6 million Americans, equivalent to 22% of the workforce, will be working remotely. These trends are driven by strong employee preferences as 98% of workers express a desire to work remotely at least some of the time, all thanks to the flexibility, autonomy, and improved work-life balance that remote work offers. Moreover, 93% of employers plan to continue conducting job interviews remotely. Remote and hybrid work have become integral to the modern work landscape, and their growth is expected to continue as both employees and employers recognize the benefits of these models. Speaking of remote work, do check out our article on best work from home jobs for 2023. It is also worth noting that remote work equally benefits employers by reducing overhead costs associated with office space and utilities and hence, increasing access to a global talent pool, and boost employee productivity and job satisfaction. It can lead to lower employee turnover rates and the ability to tap into specialized skills from anywhere, ultimately resulting in cost savings and a more diverse, efficient, and agile workforce.Story continuesAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s Chief People Officer, Gloria Chen recently mentioned: ""While we believe in the value of in-person interactions, we know that in some cases, a remote work arrangement makes sense for Adobe. We expect to double the size of our remote worker population over time as we learn and iterate on making this model successful.""Moreover, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s employees were also the happiest employees as they felt most satisfied with their pay, according to Comparably’s sixth annual report based on employee reviews. Another employment trend for 2023 is that organizations will drive DEI forward with growing pushback. To achieve the DEI goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has established 12 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which serve as platforms for employees to connect, engage, and unleash their potential. These ERGs also play a pivotal role in cultivating relationship capital and cultivating an inclusive environment and culture within the company.In terms of specific diversity goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has set ambitious targets. By 2025, the company aims to have 50% women in management positions worldwide that highlight its commitment to gender diversity. Additionally, in the United States, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is striving for 35% racial diversity in management roles. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s dedication to diversity and inclusion has also garnered recognition and accolades from various quarters. For example, it has been acknowledged by U.S. Veterans Magazine as the ""Best of the Best"" for its strides in advancing diversity efforts. Additionally, the company stands out as one of only two organizations that have consistently been included in the Working Mother 100 Best list for the past 28 years.20 Best Companies to Work for in 2023wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have looked at different surveys and indexes employed for the best companies to work for including Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For, Glassdoor’s best places to work 2023, and Reddit.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 79%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-international-inc-nasdaq-mdlz-110017970.html,1693652417,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Mondelez International's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 48% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyIf you want to know who really controls Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mondelez International. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mondelez International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Mondelez International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mondelez International, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Mondelez International. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.1% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Mondelez International, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$135m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Mondelez International. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mondelez International better, we need to consider many other factors.

MDLZ has shown resilience by leveraging its solid expansion, even amid inflated cost challenges. Strategic buyouts, efficient pricing and a focus on the core chocolate and biscuit categories have helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company drive growth.This snack food and beverage product company has outperformed the industry as well as the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in the past six months. Shares of MDLZ have increased 9% against the industry’s decline of 1.3%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consumer Staples sector has declined 0.6%.Buyouts Strengthen PortfolioMondelez's growth path has been propelled through a series of acquisitions.  The acquisition of Ricolino (concluded in the third quarter of 2023) is projected to double the size of MDLZ’s Mexican operations, while the Clif Bar buyout (August 2022) has further strengthened the company’s market presence. Contributions from the Ricolino and Clif Bar buyouts boosted net revenues in the second quarter of 2023.The integration of Chipita S.A. and Grenade (in 2022) showcases Mondelez's commitment to enhancing its product offerings. The acquisition spree, further underscored by Gourmet Food Holdings and Hu Master Holdings, has diversified Mondelez's portfolio and augmented its distribution capabilities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEmphasizing Core CompetenciesMondelez's emphasis on its core product categories, specifically chocolates and biscuits, has been a key catalyst. The shift in consumer preferences toward snacking rather than traditional meals has provided the company with a favorable opportunity to progress in these enduring categories. Both product categories recorded impressive double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2023. Management anticipates maintaining robust volume momentum in these categories as it progresses through 2023.Battling Cost HurdlesMondelez's growth story has been somewhat deterred by cost inflation. In the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 37.5% due to increased raw material and transportation costs.Also, the adjusted operating income margin was partly hurt by inflated input costs. In its second-quarter 2023 earnings release, Mondelez stated that it still expects a double-digit increase in inflation stemming from the continued elevated cost of packaging, ingredients and labor.Story continuesWrapping UpMondelez has been reaping the rewards of its proactive pricing strategies aimed at countering these challenges. The favorable outcomes of these initiatives were evident in the organic net revenue growth achieved in the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Mondelez's strategic expansion initiatives, combined with its dedication to core snacking categories and cost-control measures, place the company in a strong position for consistent growth amid a dynamic environment. Management expects 2023 organic net revenue growth of more than 12%. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth on a constant-currency basis of more than 12%.Solid Consumer Staple BetsInter Parfums IPAR, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

262,7938add2-9b80-329e-916a-1cb6bbf7f75a,OXY,2023-09-02,Here's What We Like About Occidental Petroleum's (NYSE:OXY) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-occidental-petroleums-nyse-oxy-121953837.html,1693657193,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Occidental Petroleum's shares before the 7th of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.18 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.72 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Occidental Petroleum has a trailing yield of approximately 1.1% on its current stock price of $64.57. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Occidental Petroleum paid out just 9.6% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 16% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's positive to see that Occidental Petroleum's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Occidental Petroleum's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 31% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Occidental Petroleum looks like a promising growth company.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Occidental Petroleum's dividend payments per share have declined at 10% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. Occidental Petroleum is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Occidental Petroleum? Occidental Petroleum has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Occidental Petroleum is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Occidental Petroleum (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable).Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Shares have added about 0.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Occidental due for a pullback?

The top line also declined by 37.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $10,735 million.Despite strong production volumes, the company’s performance was adversely impacted by the softness in commodity prices compared with the previous year’s quarter.Segmental DetailsOil and Gas revenues totaled $4,941 million for the reported quarter, down 35.8% year over year. Chemical revenues amounted to $1,375 million, down 27.9% from that reported in the year-ago quarter.

Such an outperformance can be attributed to higher volumes from the Permian segments. Permian’s production for the second quarter totaled 582 Mboe/d, exceeding the guided range of 558-578 Mboe/d.Total sales volume came in at 1,222 Mboe/d, up 6.3% from 1,150 Mboe/d in the year-ago period. The improvement was due to an increase in U.S. sales volume. Out of the total sales volume, 990 Mboe/d came from domestic sales, which was up 7.7% year-over-year.Story continuesRealized PricesRealized prices of crude oil decreased by 26.2% year over year to $73.91 per barrel on a worldwide basis. Realized natural gas liquids prices fell 47% from the prior-year quarter’s level to $21.67 per barrel globally.Natural gas prices declined 58.1% from the year-ago quarter’s number to $5.2 per thousand cubic feet worldwide.Highlights of the ReleaseOccidental’s total expenses for the reported quarter were $5,589 million, down 8% from $6,077 million in the year-ago period.

The decrease in the company’s debt level was due to its effective debt management since the acquisition of Anadarko.Cash flow from operations amounted to $5,940 million in the first six months of 2023 compared with $8,568 million a year ago. Total capital expenditure was $3,107 million in the first six months compared with $1,830 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2023, OXY expects production of 1,166-1,206 Mboe/d. Output from the Permian Resources segment is projected at 568-588 Mboe/d. Our model projects third-quarter total production of 1,170.2 Mboe/d for the quarter. Exploration expenses are estimated at $150 million for the third quarter and $460 million for 2023. For 2023, OXY anticipates production of 1,185-1,235 Mboe/d. Output from Permian Resources is projected at 571-589 Mboe/d for the entire year. Our model currently projects total production of 1,181.1 Mboe/d for 2023, marginally lower than the low end of the guidance. Occidental plans to invest $5.4-$6.2 billion through the year to further strengthen its operations.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -7.91% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Occidental has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

The study outcomes were presented at ESC Congress 2023, the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting.It is to be noted that the FARAPULSE PFA System received CE Mark in 2021 and has been used to treat more than 25,000 patients globally to date.Study DetailsFor treating patients with paroxysmal, or intermittent, AF, the study is the first randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of the FARAPULSE PFA System directly to standard-of-care ablation, such as radiofrequency or cryoablation.In this multicenter, prospective and randomized controlled trial, 607 patients in the United States with paroxysmal AF who had previously been unsuccessfully treated with at least one anti-arrhythmic drug were enrolled.Despite most doctors' past expertise being limited to thermal ablation, data showed the FARAPULSE PFA System was non-inferior to standard-of-care procedures. They met the primary efficacy and safety endpoints.The study's secondary safety objective showed that the FARAPULSE PFA System performed better than the thermal ablation arm (12%), significantly reducing the pulmonary veins' post-ablation constriction at three months (0.9%).Significance of the StudyGiven the stringent trial design and monitoring methods, the FARAPULSE PFA System displayed excellent overall clinical performance in this investigation, particularly the high percentage of freedom from atrial arrhythmias and the extremely low incidence of safety events. These highly expected results confirm PFA therapy with this technology as a preferred ablative treatment technique, supported by extensive earlier data from Europe.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesThese statistics highlight the innovative technology's better procedural performance, and the real-world application continues to produce positive results in terms of safety and efficacy. The FARAPULSE PFA System's performance in this trial is an encouraging sign of the potential utilization of the device in the United States.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size was valued at $1,825.85 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $3,370.70 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.4%. The expansion of the atrial fibrillation market is fueled by an increase in the frequency of atrial fibrillation in the elderly population, technical developments, and a preference for catheter ablation for cardiac arrhythmia therapy.Recent DevelopmentsIn August 2023, Boston Scientific received the FDA approval for its POLARx Cryoablation System. The POLARx FIT Cryoablation Balloon Catheter is a component of the new system intended to treat people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). This catheter has the unusual ability to accommodate two balloon diameters, 28 and 31mm.During the second quarter 2023 earnings update, the company note that it has completed enrollment in the WATCHMAN FLX Pro CT pilot study, a single-center study using multiple imaging modalities to assess post-procedural healing in the investigational WATCHMAN FLX Pro Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.Price PerformanceIn the past year, BSX shares have gained 33.2% compared with the industry’s rise of 0.6%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBoston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Quanterix QTRX and SiBone SIBN.

Shares have added about 12.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sarepta Therapeutics due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Q2 Earnings Beat, Sales Miss EstimatesSarepta reported a loss of 27 cents per share in the second quarter of 2023, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.89.However, the loss included depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based compensation expenses and one-time gains from the sale of priority review voucher. The adjusted loss for the quarter was 85 cents per share, narrower than the year-ago period’s adjusted loss of $1.18 per share.Sarepta recorded total revenues of $261.2 million, up 12% year over year. The year-over-year increase in revenues was driven by sales of Sarepta’s three currently-approved RNA-based PMO therapies for DMD. The reported revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $264.5 million.Quarter in DetailThe company’s product revenues were up 13% year over year at $239.0 million, entirely derived from the sale of the above three DMD drugs. The upside was driven by an increase in demand for DMD products. The reported product sales beat our model estimates of $235 million.The company recorded $22.3 million in collaboration revenues, primarily from its licensing agreement with Roche. In the year-ago period, management had recorded $22.0 million as collaboration revenues, which were also received from Roche.During the quarter, Sarepta did not generate any revenues from Elevidys.Adjusted research and development (R&amp;D) expenses totaled $212.2 million in the second quarter, down 8% year over year. This downside is attributable to a decline in manufacturing expenses incurred during the quarter, partially offset by an increase in clinical study expenses.Story continuesAdjusted selling, general &amp; administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $90.3 million, up 42% year over year. The upside was driven primarily by an increase in professional service expenses incurred by the company for Elevidys’ launch.2023 GuidanceSarepta reiterated its previously issued product revenue guidance for the three approved PMO drugs, which are expected to generate more than $925 million in 2023. Management did not issue a guidance on Elevidys sales stating that it will continue to evaluate the gene-therapy’s demand to provide accurate guidance.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 10.64% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Sarepta Therapeutics has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Sarepta Therapeutics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSarepta Therapeutics is part of the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.

272,fa8cd079-6b07-39df-bdc4-c124d6d2bdeb,WM,2023-09-02,"Should Income Investors Look At Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) Before Its Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-look-waste-management-122035562.html,1693657235,STORY,['WM'],"[Readers hoping to buy Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Waste Management's shares before the 7th of September to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 22nd of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.70 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.80 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Waste Management stock has a trailing yield of around 1.8% on the current share price of $157.01. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Waste Management can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Waste Management If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Waste Management's payout ratio is modest, at just 48% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 73% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Waste Management's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Waste Management earnings per share are up 4.9% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Waste Management has delivered 7.0% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Waste Management for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Waste Management paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.So while Waste Management looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Waste Management and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

277,9f97ea74-5251-3e77-a55b-45ab185f9144,DVA,2023-09-02,4 Stocks to Buy in a Booming Outpatient Home Health Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-booming-outpatient-151900921.html,1693581540,STORY,"['EHC', 'RDNT', 'OPCH', '^GSPC', 'DVA']","[The pandemic altered the nature and dynamics of the healthcare industry. The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, after struggling with lower outpatient clinic visits and inability to provide quality home healthcare, has gradually shifted to digital healthcare treatment. In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in demand for telemedicine-focused online medical and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology services. Post-pandemic, many healthcare companies that were traditionally not technology-based transformed to survive in the market. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global healthcare analytics market was valued at $35.3 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 21.4% between 2023 and 2030. Another factor prompting these MedTech players to embrace digital healthcare is the skyrocketing healthcare costs.On a positive note, rising dependence on telehealth and AI is likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. DaVita Inc. DVA, Encompass Health Corporation EHC, Option Care Health, Inc. OPCH and RadNet, Inc. RDNT are likely to gain from the prospects.Industry DescriptionThe industry comprises companies that offer ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home. They use advanced medical technologies for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. The players include operators of HMO medical centers, kidney dialysis centers and other outpatient care centers. After navigating a tough pandemic era, the payers and providers have been seeing steady growth on the back of innovation in services. This buoys optimism about prospects over the next few years, although persistent inflation in consumer prices could dent the outlook. The potential for scaling up innovation, prompted by the pandemic’s pressure on the healthcare system, is an added plus. Also, the acceleration of value-based care models and the increasing application of technology across the healthcare industry are likely to continue in the long run.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Outpatient and Home Healthcare IndustryCost Effectiveness: The primary advantage of outpatient clinics is cost-effectiveness. Outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours (overnight) or charge exorbitantly. Modern-day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options and even minor surgical procedures. Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower-cost care settings have also been driving outpatient care.Additionally, with value-based models of care steadily emerging as the future of healthcare, the shift from fee-for-service (FFS) to alternative payment models (APM) is an ongoing parallel trend. FFS will be crucial to care organizations as a benchmark through which providers can assess APM.AI’s Dominant Role: AI has been a roaring success in healthcare. It is no wonder that it has taken the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm. Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information. With the help of AI, hospitals have been achieving better outcomes, with patients receiving more efficient and personalized care. The outpatient industry has been generating huge profits from Electronic Health Records and ePrescriptions.The most visible area where AI can make a significant difference is in mental healthcare at home. Addressing the most prevalent mental health conditions among home care patients —depression, anxiety and dementia — is essential to improve overall patient well-being. In recent years, complex machine learning algorithms have become capable of analyzing large datasets of patient information, including clinical and social diagnoses. These systems can alert caregivers regarding potential triggers or warning signs of mental health deterioration.Dependence on Telehealth: The pandemic caused a decline in outpatient clinic visits where home healthcare providers struggled to offer quality care due to the risk of exposure to the virus. Though the impact of the pandemic has been far-reaching, it has accelerated healthcare innovation. Home healthcare can gain from the benefits provided by Medicare (and several other payers) that comprise a broad range of services that can be delivered in a patient’s home, including post-operative and chronic wound care. Home healthcare has seen a surge in the utilization of the telehealth platform in response to the pandemic. With the rise in elderly population and the increasing costs of in-person health care, the demand for home-based health care will emerge. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities also require home-based care.The rising demand for remote patient monitoring (RPM) has considerably driven the demand for wearable technology to monitor patient’s health. Although wearables have been popular for several years, their integration with AI has recently increased their popularity immensely and has become a powerful home healthcare tool. AI technology-powered RPM enables healthcare firms to provide consistent patient care without occupying space in their hospitals and facilities, thus reducing overcrowding.Staffing Shortages: The U.S. healthcare industry has been experiencing a severe shortage of workers at every level, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among support personnel, there is a laxity of home health aides. The increasing international migration of health workers may aggravate health workforce shortfalls, especially in low-income and lower-middle income countries. Another reason for the acute staffing shortage is high burnout due to physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Thus, these overworked employees are leaving the profession at an accelerating rate.Healthcare staffing shortages lead to poor patient outcomes that can include hospital-acquired infections, patient falls and increased probabilities of death. With a lesser number of staff available in hospital settings for patient care, there has been a gradual shift toward home healthcare for non-critical patients who can be monitored remotely.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it in the top 16% of nearly 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

282,f4dc1b86-92f8-3610-9709-c89cd741a523,SRE,2023-09-02,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Sempra (NYSE:SRE),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-sempra-nyse-130644799.html,1693573604,STORY,['SRE'],"[Key InsightsUsing the Dividend Discount Model, Sempra fair value estimate is US$64.32Current share price of US$70.22 suggests Sempra is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$83.90 analyst price target for SRE is 30% more than our estimate of fair valueDoes the September share price for Sempra (NYSE:SRE) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Sempra The MethodWe have to calculate the value of Sempra slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$70.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$2.6 / (6.2% – 2.2%)= US$64.3dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sempra as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SempraStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Sempra, there are three relevant factors you should explore:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for Sempra  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.Future Earnings: How does SRE's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

286,47d90884-7cf4-3b60-ab60-0f926572c1be,VLO,2023-09-02,Murphy USA (MUSA) Up 7.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/murphy-usa-musa-7-6-153136328.html,1693582296,STORY,"['MUSA', 'VLO']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Murphy USA (MUSA). Shares have added about 7.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Murphy USA due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Murphy USA’s Q2 Earnings Miss EstimateMurphy USA announced second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $6.02, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.09 and fell from the year-ago profit of $7.53. The underperformance could be attributed to a fall in the retail gasoline price and fuel contribution, partly offset by higher-than-expected petroleum product sales.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.6 billion fell 17.5% year over year and came below the consensus mark by $22 million.Merchandise sales, at $1 billion, rose 5.5% year over year and outperformed our estimate of $994 million. Revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4.5 billion, ahead of our estimate of $4.4 billion but down 21.8% from the second quarter of 2022.Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution fell 13.5% year over year to $365.8 million despite a slight margin improvement. This could be attributed to a drop in total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results), which came in at 29.5 cents per gallon, 15.5% lower than the second quarter of 2022.Retail fuel contribution increased 4.3% year over year to $334.7 million as margins, at 27 cents per gallon, edged up 1.9% from the corresponding period of 2022. Retail gallons rose 2.3% from the year-ago period to 1,238.8 million in the quarter under review but missed our projection of 1,241.9 million. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) dropped 1.1% from the second quarter of 2022 to 245.2 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.21 per gallon, down from $4.21 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 5.1% to $206.8 million on higher sales, which more than offset the marginal fall in unit margins, from 19.8% a year ago to 19.7% in the second quarter of 2023. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 2.8% year over year, primarily on the back of 2.9% higher non-tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 2.7% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The company’s monthly fuel gallons were down 0.6% from the prior-year period, though merchandise sales increased 2.9% on an average per store month basis.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Jun 30, Murphy USA — which opened seven new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,725 — had cash and cash equivalents of $92.9 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 70.4%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $95.1 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 5.35% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Murphy USA has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Murphy USA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMurphy USA is part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry. Over the past month, Valero Energy (VLO), a stock from the same industry, has gained 3.4%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2023 more than a month ago.Valero Energy reported revenues of $34.51 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.2%. EPS of $5.40 for the same period compares with $11.36 a year ago.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.25 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.5%.

If you want to skip our in-depth analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Companies to Work for in 2023.As we step into 2023, the adage ""people are a company's greatest asset"" has never rung truer. The competitive edge now hinges on more than just profit margins and market share; it rests firmly on a company's ability to foster an environment where innovation thrives, where diversity is celebrated, and where employees find not just a job, but a genuine sense of purpose. Let’s explore what are the current trends driving employment around the world.Employment Trends in 2023 and the Key Players Remote and hybrid work have become undeniable trends that are reshaping the modern workforce. In 2023, 12.7% of full-time employees already work remotely, and 28.2% have embraced a hybrid work model that indicates the rapid evolution of work environments. Looking ahead, it's predicted that by 2025, about 32.6 million Americans, equivalent to 22% of the workforce, will be working remotely. These trends are driven by strong employee preferences as 98% of workers express a desire to work remotely at least some of the time, all thanks to the flexibility, autonomy, and improved work-life balance that remote work offers. Moreover, 93% of employers plan to continue conducting job interviews remotely. Remote and hybrid work have become integral to the modern work landscape, and their growth is expected to continue as both employees and employers recognize the benefits of these models. Speaking of remote work, do check out our article on best work from home jobs for 2023. It is also worth noting that remote work equally benefits employers by reducing overhead costs associated with office space and utilities and hence, increasing access to a global talent pool, and boost employee productivity and job satisfaction. It can lead to lower employee turnover rates and the ability to tap into specialized skills from anywhere, ultimately resulting in cost savings and a more diverse, efficient, and agile workforce.Story continuesAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s Chief People Officer, Gloria Chen recently mentioned: ""While we believe in the value of in-person interactions, we know that in some cases, a remote work arrangement makes sense for Adobe. We expect to double the size of our remote worker population over time as we learn and iterate on making this model successful.""Moreover, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s employees were also the happiest employees as they felt most satisfied with their pay, according to Comparably’s sixth annual report based on employee reviews. Another employment trend for 2023 is that organizations will drive DEI forward with growing pushback. To achieve the DEI goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has established 12 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which serve as platforms for employees to connect, engage, and unleash their potential. These ERGs also play a pivotal role in cultivating relationship capital and cultivating an inclusive environment and culture within the company.In terms of specific diversity goals, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has set ambitious targets. By 2025, the company aims to have 50% women in management positions worldwide that highlight its commitment to gender diversity. Additionally, in the United States, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is striving for 35% racial diversity in management roles. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s dedication to diversity and inclusion has also garnered recognition and accolades from various quarters. For example, it has been acknowledged by U.S. Veterans Magazine as the ""Best of the Best"" for its strides in advancing diversity efforts. Additionally, the company stands out as one of only two organizations that have consistently been included in the Working Mother 100 Best list for the past 28 years.20 Best Companies to Work for in 2023wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have looked at different surveys and indexes employed for the best companies to work for including Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For, Glassdoor’s best places to work 2023, and Reddit.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores.

(NASDAQ:ADP) Suggests It's 28% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-automatic-data-processing-130022877.html,1693573222,STORY,['ADP'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Automatic Data Processing is US$353 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityAutomatic Data Processing's US$255 share price signals that it might be 28% undervalued The US$258 analyst price target for ADP is 27% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Is Automatic Data Processing Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.58bUS$5.83bUS$6.66bUS$6.49bUS$6.96bUS$7.24bUS$7.50bUS$7.73bUS$7.95bUS$8.16bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.11%Est @ 3.52%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.62% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$5.2kUS$5.1kUS$5.5kUS$5.0kUS$5.0kUS$4.9kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.2b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.2%) = US$184bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$184b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$97bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$146b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$255, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.905. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Automatic Data ProcessingStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

295,885adf58-de3b-3eeb-af39-905a2dd4ee95,DHI,2023-09-02,Investors Shouldn't Overlook D.R. Horton's (NYSE:DHI) Impressive Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-shouldnt-overlook-d-r-120037691.html,1693656037,STORY,['DHI'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for D.R. Horton, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$6.4b ÷ (US$32b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, D.R. Horton has an ROCE of 24%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Durables industry average of 15%. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for D.R. Horton compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for D.R. Horton.What Does the ROCE Trend For D.R. Horton Tell Us?The trends we've noticed at D.R. Horton are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 24%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 124%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.The Bottom Line On D.R. Horton's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that D.R. Horton can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a staggering 196% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if D.R. Horton can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for D.R. Horton  that we think you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

DKS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Delta Air Lines DAL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Comfort Systems USA provides comprehensive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement services.The company performs most of its services within manufacturing plants, office buildings, retail centers, apartment complexes, and healthcare, education, and government facilities.Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company's earnings outlook, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company resides within the Zacks Building Products – Air Conditioner and Heating industry, currently ranked in the top 2% of all Zacks industries due to positive earnings estimate revisions.As many know, roughly half of a stock's movement can be attributed to its group, helping to clarify the importance of targeting industries seeing bright outlooks.Aside from the improved earnings outlook and favorable industry standing, let's take a closer look at a few other traits of Comfort Systems USA.Comfort Systems USAThe company sports a solid growth profile, with Zacks Consensus Estimates suggesting 44% EPS growth on 21% higher revenues in its current year. And peeking ahead to FY24, expectations allude to a further 15% improvement in earnings paired with a 15% revenue bump. FIX carries a Style Score of ""B"" for Growth.Income-focused investors could be attracted to FIX also, with shares currently yielding a respectable 0.5% annually. While the yield may be on the lower end, the company's 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.In addition, the company has been a stellar earnings performer, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of more than 20% across its last four releases. Just in its latest release, Comfort Systems USA posted an 18% EPS beat and reported revenue 7% above expectations.Story continuesThe company's top line growth has remained steady and accelerated in recent quarters.Perhaps to the surprise of some, shares have long-time outperformed the general market in a big way, annualizing a sizable 29% return over the last decade vs. the S&amp;P 500's 12.8%. FIX shares have seen bullish activity following each of its previous three quarterly releases.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Comfort Systems USA would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc. is a significant omnichannel sporting goods retailer that offers athletic shoes, apparel, accessories, and a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, fishing, tennis, golf, water sports, and more.Analysts have slashed their earnings expectations as of late, pushing the stock down into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let's take a closer look at a few other characteristics of DKS.DICK'S Sporting GoodsThe company's latest quarterly report disappointed investors, with DKS falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 25% and delivering a fractional revenue surprise. Earnings declined 24% year-over-year, whereas revenue climbed 3.6% from the same period last year.The company's profitability picture was massively impacted by elevated inventory shrink, a phenomenon DKS says many retailers are currently facing. And to top it off, DKS lowered its FY23 EPS outlook, causing shares to plummet post-earnings.Shares now yield 3.5% annually following the sell-off, with a payout ratio sitting at 34% of the company's earnings. It's worth noting that the company has been committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, sporting a 25% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.In addition, DKS shares presently trade at a 9.4X forward earnings multiple (F1), below the 10.8X five-year median and the respective Zacks industry average. Shares have traded as high as 12.5X in 2023.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and a recent negative quarterly print paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.DICK'S Sporting Goods is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:Buy Labor Day Weekend Await U.S. Airlines: 3 Stocks to WatchIt is a well-documented fact that air travel demand has bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows. Driven by the buoyant passenger volumes in the current summer season, which has been the busiest one ever, the upcoming Labor Day holiday period is expected to be a very busy one for U.S. airlines.The bullish expectation of the Transportation Security Administration or TSA pertaining to traffic volumes during the Labor Day holiday weekend further highlights the encouraging scenario. Therefore, we believe that investors interested in the industry would do well to keep U.S. airline stocks like United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines on their radar.With people taking to the skies in a big way in the post-COVID period, the airline industry, one of the hardest hit corners in the pandemic peak, is currently in good shape. Driven by the concept of 'Revenge travel', a term emanating from the prolonged periods of lockdown, people remain eager to undertake a flight despite headwinds like flight disruptions caused by labor shortages. Revenge travel highlights a strong desire to travel in response to the monotony and exhaustion of life caused by the COVID-19-induced lockdown.Driven by the travel surge, the Federal Aviation Administration expects the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend to be the third busiest one in 2023 so far, after the Juneteenth weekend, which was inclusive of Father's Day, and the break for Presidents Day.The TSA's ProjectionThe TSA anticipates screening more than 14 million passengers in the Sep 1-Sep 6 period, despite the likely disruptions caused by the tropical storm Idalia. The busiest day during the period is likely to be Sep 1. On that day, TSA expects to screen more than 2.7 million travelers passing through security checkpoints.Per TSA administrator David Pekoske, ""We anticipate this Labor Day holiday weekend will be busy, with passenger volumes nearly 11% higher than last year, volumes that already exceeded 2019 Labor Day holiday travel volumes.""Highlighting the upbeat air-travel demand scenario, the TSA stated that it has screened approximately 227.5 million passengers since the Memorial Day weekend. This translates into an average of 2.5 million per day. To aid travel, many U.S. airlines are offering low fares for passengers who book their travel by Labor Day.Given this rosy scenario, we have highlighted three airline stocks, that investors should keep tabs on.Our ChoicesUnited Airlines: UAL is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and international air travel demand. Anticipating to be extremely busy over the Labor Day holiday period, UAL's management expects that nearly 2.8 million passengers will travel by its flights in the Aug 31-Sep 5 period.Riding on the buoyant air traffic scenario, UAL shares have gained 32.9% year to date. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other occasion. The average beat was 17.2%. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereAmerican Airlines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. To meet the anticipated demand swell over the Aug 31-Sep 5 period, AAL aims to operate approximately 32,000 flights during this period. The carrier expects that nearly 3.5 million passengers will travel by its flights in the above timeframe.AAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the last four quarters, with an average of 19.2%. AAL shares have gained 16.1% year to date.Delta Air Lines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is likely to aid Delta in attracting significant traffic during the Labor Day holiday period.DAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other two occasions. The average beat was 2.1%. DAL shares have gained 31.5% year to date.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This new water main will also connect two portions of the system, will benefit a large portion of Exeter Township by providing better water quality and new fire protection to nearly 50 premises.The Pennsylvanian unit has been upgrading and maintaining its water and wastewater infrastructure by replacing old water mains methodically and has invested nearly $490 million in 2022 for infrastructure upgrades. Proper infrastructure maintenance allows Pennsylvania American Water to serve its 2.3 million customers more efficiently.Urgent Upgrade is NecessaryPer the ASCE report, nearly 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost each day in the United States due to water main breaks every two minutes. This wastage of potable water is no doubt increasing the cost of operation for water utilities.Miles of aging pipelines essentially require repairs and upgrades to maintain quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water and sewer services.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure, like storage tanks and purifying units, needs maintenance at proper intervals.Utilities are InvestingAmerican Water Works aims to invest $2.9 billion in 2023 to strengthen and expand its water and wastewater infrastructure. The company has an extensive long-term plan to upgrade and expand its infrastructure.Water utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve the water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 5.1%. The long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth of the company is currently pegged at 5.6%.

The average residential user using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month will start paying an extra 14 cents per month, starting in 2024. The surcharge is anticipated by the companies to stay the same in 2025 and to drop to 11 cents per month in 2026. All residential customers of Mon Power and Potomac Edison will be responsible for the additional cost of building the three sites.Details of the ProjectPSC's approval in August 2023, to the companies' proposal to finish three of five planned solar sites marked the beginning of the construction phase. These five locations will produce 50 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, 1 MW of solar energy can power 173 households nationwide on average.The Commission had already given initial clearance for the development, prior to the final permission being granted once the companies secured enough industrial, commercial and residential customers to utilize around 85% of the renewable energy supplied by the sites. These criteria have been satisfied by the three locations that are planned in the counties of Monongalia, Marion and Berkeley. Once consumers sign up for the electricity they will produce, the companies intend to ask the PSC for permission to develop the remaining two solar sites.Transition to Renewable EnergyFirstEnergy is focused on lowering emission levels and has undertaken initiatives for the same. In 2015, FirstEnergy had set a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2045. In November 2020, it updated the target to attain 100% carbon neutrality by 2050, with a mid-term goal of 30% reduction in greenhouse gases within the company's direct operational control by 2030 from the 2019 level.To address its goal, Mon Power and Potomac Edison signed an agreement with the town of Harpers Ferry in West Virginia in January 2023, to advance the use of clean energy. The town has committed to a subscription equal to 100% of its streetlight and town hall energy usage in support of the companies’ generation of solar power.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsPer the U.S. Energy Information Administration report, Renewable energy capacity has been growing rapidly, and it expects this growth to continue because the electric power sector plans to add 27 gigawatts (GW) of new solar generating capacity by the end of 2023 and a further 31 GW in 2024.Other electric power companies like Dominion Energy Inc. D, Duke Energy Corp. DUK and Alliant Energy Corp. LNT are set to benefit from growing solar market in the United States.In August 2023, Dominion Energy unveiled a solar and energy storage project at the Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC, marking the largest renewable energy project ever developed at a U.S. airport. In partnership with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, D plans an 835-acre, 100 MW capacity solar energy on the southwestern edge of the airport, along with a 50-MW energy storage facility.D’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 20%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.3% in the last four quarters.  Duke Energy currently operates 1,200 MW of solar energy in Florida, with plans to continue adding approximately 300 MW a year going forward. To achieve this target, Duke Energy Florida announced two new solar projects in March 2023, as part of Clean Energy Connection, the company's community solar program. Once complete, each 74.9-MW solar facility will generate enough carbon-free electricity to power 23,000 homes.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 6.5%.Alliant Energy is the largest owner-operator of regulated solar energy in Wisconsin. The company plans to add 1.1 GW of solar energy within the state by mid-2024. In August 2023, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved two Alliant Energy battery energy storage projects — the 100-MW Grant County Battery Project and the 75-MW Wood County Battery Project.LNT’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.47%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, FirstEnergy Corp. FE, Entergy Corp. ETR, Atmos Energy Corp. ATO and J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. JJSF.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Safe Stocks to Buy Amid Declining Consumer ConfidenceJob openings are shrinking, and the confidence level of Americans has taken a hit. Also, the second-quarter GDP grew slower than it was earlier estimated. Understandably, fears about the economy's health and an impending recession have once again escalated over the past month.Americans, who were a lot more confident in July, are suddenly worried. Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks that assure steady returns seems prudent.Q2 GDP Growth Revised, Job Openings NarrowOn Aug 30, The ADP National Employment report showed that private payrolls increased by just 177,000 in August, a lot lower than the upwardly revised reported 371,000 in July. This also missed the consensus estimate of 195,000.This follows the JOLTS report released on Aug 29, which showed that job openings declined to 8.8 million in July, lower than the consensus estimate of 9.5 million. Also, only 3.5 million workers quit their jobs in July, the lowest level in nearly two-and-a-half years.Clearly, the labor market is cooling. Lower job openings mean lower chances of people getting jobs. At the same time, fewer workers quitting their jobs decreases the chance of higher wages, which means lower personal income.In fact, the ADP report mentioned that job stayers saw a pay rise of 5.9% year over year in August, the slowest growth since October 2021.This came as the U.S. second-quarter GDP growth was revised down to 2.1% at an annualized rate from the earlier reported 2.4%.Story continuesConsumer Confidence Takes a HitA slowing economy and sky-high inflation have been denting investors' confidence. The confidence level reflected in Americans in July took a hit in August and declined to 106.1 from July's revised reading of 114, the Conference Board said on Aug 29. Analysts had expected it to touch 116.Moreover, a drop in consumers' assessment of future business scenarios is a distinct indicator that people are experiencing a sense of helplessness concerning an imminent economic downturn.In August, consumers' evaluation of current economic conditions saw a significant decline, plummeting to 114.8 from the previous month's reading of 153. Moreover, their outlook on economic conditions for the upcoming six-month period also deteriorated, dropping to 80.2 this month compared to 88 in July.Although inflation has more than halved over the past 12 months, it still remains elevated and a lot higher than the Fed's target range of 2%. This has made Fed officials maintain their hawkish stance, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicating more interest rate hikes.This is likely to further dent consumer confidence given that borrowing costs are already high after the central bank raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples, and utilities.

To skip our detailed analysis of the European economy, you can go directly to 5 Richest to Poorest Countries in Europe by GDP Per Capita (PPP).Europe is a fairly economically stable region compared to the rest of the world. The major reason for that is the open trade between European Union (EU) countries. The poorest countries in Europe are still far better than the poorest countries in Arab and Africa. The EU operates as a single market comprising 27 countries. According to the European Union, the total GDP value of goods and services produced in the EU region accounted for EUR14.5 trillion in 2021. Lately, there have been economic hurdles for European countries, facing increasing inflation, higher interest rates, and energy crises led by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Let's discuss these hurdles.Europe's Economic OutlookEurope has some grueling tasks to maintain such as dropping inflation and sustaining financial stability to preserve its economic growth. Since the middle of 2022, Europe’s growth has tumbled leading to a rise in inflation as households’ real incomes decreased. European countries were able to avoid an all-out recession last winter due to lower energy prices and government reliefs. While monetary policy is getting hostile, there are risks across the financial sector. With all these risks roaming around Europe’s economy, the outlook suggests slow growth and high inflation. The positives for Europe are the lower energy prices and ease in supply bottlenecks. As per IMF’s April 2023 Regional Economic Outlook, Europe is expected to relax financial conditions in 2024, which should support a slow recovery. Emerging European economies are expected to perform better than advanced European economies. Annual growth for advanced European economies and emerging European economies is projected to rebound from 0.7% in 2023 to 1.4% in 2024 and from 1.1% to 3%, respectively. The inflation in advanced European economies is expected to drop to 5.6% in 2023 and 3% in 2024 and inflation in emerging European economies is anticipated to decline to 11.7% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2024.Story continuesIn addition, the GDP growth for European economies is forecasted to plunge to 0.7% in advanced European economies and 1.1% in emerging European economies in 2023. The overall GDP growth is expected to bounce back to 1.4% and 3% in 2024, respectively. The April 2023 Regional Economic Outlook highlights:“Inflation remains very high, but economic growth has slowed rapidly as some financial sector risks have materialized and Europe continues to grapple with the fallout from the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the pandemic. The expected recovery in the course of the year assumes that policymakers manage to keep financial stress contained and tame inflation without a recession. Given still tight labor markets, monetary policy will need to remain contractionary until inflation subsides decisively. Fiscal consolidation will need to become more decisive. Financial stability could be tested again, and policymakers should closely monitor developments, identify weaknesses, and take swift action where needed.”Russia-Ukraine War Impact on European EconomyRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has had a severe impact not only on the European economy but the global economy as well. The global economy was fighting the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic as the Russia-Ukraine war began, adding further economic constraints. The war has massively triggered shocks in energy and food markets, restraining supply and increasing prices to unprecedented levels. Compared to the rest of the world, Europe has been particularly vulnerable to economic crises driven by the Russia-Ukraine war. According to the European Central Bank, in January 2023, food prices soared by 14.1% year over year. The food products that were imported from Ukraine and Russia, such as wheat and oilseeds, played a massive role in the increase in food inflation. For instance, European countries had to pay 47% higher prices for sunflower oil and other edible oils in January 2023, year over year. However, things are getting better in the European market as inflation is starting to drop. Business Environment in EuropeThe situation is getting better as food inflation rates have started to cool across Europe. July's inflation showed a comparable month-on-month decline in the European Union. According to Eurostat, the annual inflation rate in the euro area dropped from 5.5% in June to 5.3% in July. Whereas in July 2022, the annual inflation rate was 9.8%. The highest contribution to the annual euro area inflation rate in July 2023 was driven by services with +2.47% points followed by the food, alcohol &amp; tobacco sectors contributing +2.20% points.With a slow growth recovery and a decline expected in inflation in the European economy in 2024, the business environment would bring suitable opportunities for new startups and established market players. As we have highlighted, food prices have been the key point for the European economy. Some of the key players from the food industry have a big role to play including Nestle SA (SWX:NESN), Unilever plc (LON:ULVR), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). On August 31, Reuters reported that France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire said the French government made a deal with food companies to cope with inflation. However, Nestle SA (SWX:NESN), Unilever plc (LON:ULVR), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) were not ""cooperating"" with the agreement, added Le Maire. The French government wishes to restrict the increasing food prices in the country. However, food giants have their way of dealing with the situation. All three multinational food companies have performed significantly well during the first half year of 2023, despite the economic troubles. On July 27, Nestle SA (SWX:NESN) announced the results of the first half of 2023, posting revenue of CHF 46.3 billion. The company reported its earnings per share of CHF 2.13, up 11.1% year over year. Nestle SA (SWX:NESN) CEO Mark Schneider has pointed out that they have priced their products very moderately and conservatively. On July 27, Reuters reported that Nestle SA (SWX:NESN) has highlighted that they will raise prices at a moderate rate during the remaining half of 2023. The price increases have allowed Nestle SA (SWX:NESN) to cover up its expenses and report positive and strong earnings. Similarly, Unilever plc (LON:ULVR) also posted strong first-half outcomes for 2023. On July 25, Unilever plc (LON:ULVR) reported a half-year 2023 sales turnover of EUR30.4 billion, a 9.1% higher sales growth compared to H1 2022. Unilever plc (LON:ULVR) sales growth in Europe was 6.4% during H1 2023, which is 20% of the global sales of the company. Unilever plc's (LON:ULVR) growth across Europe was broad-based and price-led across countries, with double-digit growth in the United Kingdom and Spain, led by Personal Care. In H1 2023 outcomes, Unilever plc (LON:ULVR) pointed out that it will keep its prices moderate considering the volatility and high-cost environment. Here are some of the comments from the H1 2023 report:""In a volatile and high-cost environment, we will deliver another year of strong underlying sales growth in 2023. We expect underlying sales growth for the full year to be above 5%, ahead of our multi-year range, with underlying price growth continuing to moderate through the year. Our expectation for net material inflation (NMI) for 2023 is around EUR2 billion of which EUR0.4 billion is anticipated in the second half. We continue to expect a modest improvement in underlying operating margin for the full year, reflecting higher gross margin and increased investment behind our brands."" On July 13, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) reported its Q2 2023 earnings and posted strong outcomes with earnings per share of $2.09, surpassing EPS consensus by $0.13. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) CEO Ramon Laguarta mentioned that consumer responses have been positive despite the rise in prices. Here are some of the comments from Q2 2023 earnings call:""We’ve been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands. We’re seeing consumers shopping in more stores than before. They’re looking for better deals. They’re starting to look for optimization. They’re going to channels that have better perceived value. They’re buying more in Dollar stores or they buy more in mass or in clubs. So every segment of the consumer is making adjustment.""Richest to Poorest Countries in Europe by GDP Per Capita (PPP)Photo by Jacek Dylag on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the richest to poorest countries in Europe by GDP per capita (PPP), we sourced the data from the IMF’s database which tracks GDP per capita, purchasing power parity (PPP) (current international $).

Rajiv?Rajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. We delivered a good fourth quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance, capping off a strong fiscal 2023. The uncertain macro backdrop that we saw in our fourth quarter was largely unchanged compared with the prior quarter and we continue to see steady demand for our solutions in Q4. This was driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered strong ACV billings growth and record quarterly revenue of $494 million, a nearly $2 billion annualized run-rate.We also had another quarter of good free cash flow generation despite some expected one-time payments. Overall, our fourth quarter financial performance was a strong finish to our fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2023 results demonstrate the progress we’ve made with our subscription model. Specifically, we delivered healthy year-over-year ACV billings growth of 27%, led by outperformance of our renewals business. We also delivered our first year of non-GAAP profitability in the company’s history with a non-GAAP operating margin of 9%. Finally, despite the impact of several one-time payments, we generated free cash flow in excess of $200 million, a roughly tenfold increase compared to our prior fiscal year. Beyond the financials, we made significant progress across all aspects of our business in fiscal 2023.On the product front, we delivered general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure, announced meaningful new products in areas such as Kubernetes, data services and cloud management and defined our data services vision with Project Beacon to enable companies to build portable applications. We also enhanced our corporate governance profile through amendments to our bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Finally, on the go-to-market front, we closed multiple large deals with major enterprise and government customers. These wins demonstrate the strategic relevance of our platform to our customers’ key transformation initiatives and the success of our focus on landing these larger, more strategic transactions. Overall, for fiscal 2023, we demonstrated consistent execution, solid top line growth, strong renewables performance, sharp improvements in profitability and free cash flow and continued progress on our longer-term strategic priorities.Moving on, gaining sales leverage by our partners has been a priority since I joined as CEO. We said we would focus on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact in how we go to market as well as provide more opportunities within larger accounts. This week, we made a milestone announcement on this front with a global strategic partnership with Cisco. This partnership is about combining the best of breed between our two companies. Cisco will combine the Nutanix cloud platform, along with their UCS compute and cloud management, deeply integrated with their networking and security. It’s a fully integrated solution with joint engineering and interoperability and expanded support that will be sold by Cisco. We are excited about working with Cisco on this partnership and having themselves our leading hybrid multi-cloud software, leveraging their extensive go-to-market reach.Now I’d like to talk about our customer wins this quarter, which demonstrate the success we’ve been having in landing large multimillion-dollar ACV deals. A good example is a significant expansion we won in Q4 with the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP, the UK’s biggest public service department. This win demonstrated the value customers are seeing in the broader capabilities of our platform. DWP has already adopted our cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and Nutanix Unified Storage to run its business critical workloads and was looking for a way to extend its footprint into the public cloud. In Q4, DWP chose NC2 to enable the shift of workloads from the private cloud to the public cloud. In their words, “Nutanix NC2 allows DWP to seamlessly extend our on-premise footprint into public cloud, while avoiding the cost traditionally associated with lift and shift migrations.Furthermore, NC2’s cost effectiveness and ease of use enable us to maintain a layer of abstraction for our most critical workloads that avoids both platform and vendor lock-in.” We couldn’t have said this better ourselves and are grateful for the opportunity to partner with DWP on their cloud journey. Another notable win in the quarter was as a service provider partner in the EMEA region that was implementing a nationwide electronic health record or EHR system for a government health ministry. This partner chose Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and our AHV hypervisor to host critical EHR applications across 20 strategically located sites. They also chose Nutanix Unified Storage for managing the data on GPU-based image servers associated with the project.We see this win as a testament to the value our customers see in adopting our full stack offering and the growing contribution we are seeing from our service provider partners. Now, I’d like to talk about AI and what it means to Nutanix now and in the future. Today, we already have customers using our platform to deploy AI, often for inferencing on video or sensor data who are seeing the same agility, performance and TCO benefits from our platform as customers running other workloads. They are deploying us for use cases ranging from faster checkout and retail applications, ensuring compliance with safety protocols at construction sites, to quality assurance and manufacturing applications. However, we see an emerging opportunity in the surging demand for generative AI.To-date, there has been a lot of investment in large language models or LLMs running in the public cloud. However, as AI models become more compact and organizations become concerned with issues such as intellectual property leakage, compliance and privacy, we expect there will be more demand to fine-tune and run models on premises and at the edge. We believe there is an opportunity to provide a turnkey solution for those looking to jumpstart these AI initiatives. That’s why we recently launched GPT-in-a-Box. This is a full stack, software-defined AI-ready platform along with services to help our customers size and configure hardware and software to deploy a curated set of LLMs using the leading open source AI frameworks on our platform. It allows customers to easily deploy AI-ready infrastructure to fine-tune and run generative pre-trained transformers or GPTs, while maintaining control of their data and applications.While it’s still early, we are pleased with the initial interest we have seen to-date in GPT-in-a-Box. Moving on, I’d like to highlight the recent addition of Mark Templeton to our Board of Directors. Mark’s previous tenure as a public company CEO combined with the strong domain knowledge of both cloud and data center infrastructure software makes him an excellent fit for Nutanix. I look forward to working with him closely as we execute on our hybrid multi-cloud vision. Finally, on the back of our strong free cash flow performance in FY ‘23 and in conjunction with our earnings release, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $350 million share repurchase authorization. We see this repurchase program as a reflection of confidence in the company’s long-term market opportunity and financial outlook and an important milestone in our subscription journey.In closing, we are encouraged with the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to provide an initial outlook for fiscal ‘24 that calls for continued solid top line growth, improving profitability and solid free cash flow growth from a strong fiscal 2023 level. We look forward to providing an update on our strategic priorities and longer term financial outlook at our Investor Day in September. And we remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?Rukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first provide commentary on our Q4 ‘23 results and fiscal year ‘23 results, followed by our outlook for Q1 ‘24 and fiscal year ‘24. Q4 ‘23 was a good quarter in which we exceeded all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q4, was $279 million, higher than our guidance of $240 million to $250 million. Revenue in Q4 was $494 million, higher than our guidance of $470 million to $480 million. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.562 billion, a year-over-year growth of 30%. Similar to last quarter, we saw a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. New logo additions were about 500 in Q4. Average contract duration in Q4 was 3 years, flat quarter-over-quarter as expected.Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 85.8%, higher than our expectations because of higher revenue than expected, certain non-recurring savings and timing of hiring. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $361 million. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 13%, higher than our guidance of 9% to 10%. Non-GAAP net income was $68 million or EPS of $0.24 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 286 million shares. Billings linearity was good and DSOs were 29 days in Q4. Free cash flow in Q4 was $46 million, implying free cash flow margin of 9%, higher than our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected billings and collections. We ended Q4 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.437 billion, up from $1.358 billion in Q3 ‘23.Looking at our full year financial results, we exceeded all guided metrics for fiscal year ‘23 as well. ACV billings in fiscal year ‘23 were $957 million, higher than our guidance of $915 million to $925 million and representing a year-over-year growth of 27%. A reminder that the annual ACV billings is slightly lower than the sum of the ACV billings from the four quarters due to adjustments for deals with duration of less than a year. Revenue in fiscal year ‘23 was $1.863 billion, higher than our guidance of $1.84 billion to $1.85 billion and representing a year-over-year growth of 18%. A reminder that revenue in fiscal year ‘23 benefited from the normalization of orders with future start dates, resulting from our partner supply chain challenges.Largely because of this dynamic, fiscal year ‘23 revenue included the benefit of approximately $23 million in deferred license revenue that would have been recognized in late fiscal year ‘22 instead. We ended fiscal year ‘23 with an ARR of $1.562 billion, as mentioned earlier, a year-over-year growth of 30%. GRR or gross retention rate at the end of fiscal year ‘23 was 90-plus percent, and NRR, or net retention rate was 123%. Our fiscal year new and expansion ACV performance was impacted by some of the macro uncertainty we have previously discussed and performed slightly below our expectations entering the year and below what we believe its longer term potential is. The renewals business continues to perform well and it tends to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to our new and expansion business.Our relative economics and renewals have also continued to improve over time as the renewal team has improved their execution. Average contract duration in fiscal year ‘23 was 3 years, lower than the 3.2 years in fiscal year ‘22 as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal year ‘23 was 84.6%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal year ‘23 were $1.414 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year ‘23 was 9%, representing our first year of non-GAAP operating profit. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million, or EPS of $0.60 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 282 million shares. Free cash flow in fiscal year ‘23 was $207 million, implying free cash flow margin of 11%, representing a free cash flow margin expansion of 10 percentage points year-over-year.Overall, fiscal year ‘23 was a significant year, marking our first year with a positive non-GAAP operating margin at 9%, significant free cash flow generation of over $200 million while growing ARR at 30% and growing revenue at 18% year-over-year, all in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Moving on to Q1. The outlook for Q1 ‘24 is as follows: ACV billings of $260 million to $270 million, revenue of $495 million to $505 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%, non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 11%. The guidance for full year fiscal year ‘24 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.075 billion to $1.095 billion, exceeding the $1 billion threshold and representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint; revenue of $2.085 billion to $2.115 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint of the range; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%; non-GAAP operating margin of 11% to 12%; and free cash flow of $280 million to $300 million.I will now provide some commentary regarding our fiscal year ‘24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of sales cycles. Our fiscal year ‘24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumes some impact from these macro dynamics. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewal business will continue to perform well. And while our available to renew or ACR pool continues to grow year-over-year, it is growing at a slower pace in fiscal year ‘24, but is expected to reaccelerate in fiscal year ‘25 based on our current view. Third, the full year guidance assumes that the average contract duration would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year ‘23 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings.And regarding our bottom line guidance, we will continue to make targeted and prudent investments into our go-to-market and innovation engine to continue to invest in growth, while improving our profitability and free cash flow margin year-over-year. Overall, we remain confident in our view around a large and growing market for our solutions combined with a growing mix of renewals as a significant driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $350 million. We remain focused on investing in our business to support profitable growth and on delivering strong returns for our shareholders. This share repurchase program is consistent with these objectives and a reflection of the confidence we have in our long-term market opportunity and financial outlook.In closing, we are pleased that our fiscal year ‘23 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.See also 11 Cheap Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before the Next Breakout and 16 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy Today.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.Pinjalim Bora: Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking questions. Rajiv, I wanted to talk about AI. The GPT-in-a-Box, help us understand, is that largely kind of integrated offering, kind of with a bundled pricing? Or is there any new functionality that you have developed. And it seems like it’s spend across hardware, software and services. How are you kind of thinking of going to market with it?Operator: [Operator Instructions]Rajiv Ramaswami: Pinjalim, can you hear me now?Pinjalim Bora: Yes. I can hear.Rajiv Ramaswami: Okay, sorry. Yes. So first of all, in terms of the platform, it’s the same Nutanix cloud platform integrated with standard server platforms with NVIDIA DPUs as part of the solution, okay? And on top of that, what we add is a curated set of MLOps software and LLMs, largely open source models, and we put that all together with the services offering that helps customers deploy this out of the box. Now what do they use it for? So what we see with generative AI is there’s been a lot of focus about training these large LLM models in the public cloud. But when it comes to the actual usage of these, what you’re going to see is companies need to run these AI models where their data is. And in a lot of applications, enterprise applications, sensitive data is stored on-prem or at edge locations where they’re actually gathering the data in the first place.So with GPT-in-a-Box, they can run their AI applications, their applications by fine-tuning these large LLM models that have been changed in the public cloud using what we call foundational models and public data. They can find tune this, make them more compact to run with their own data and use it on-prem. So that’s the offering. Now in terms of go-to-market, we have a small tiger team that’s very focused on working with our customers as we put use cases together. We are also building an ecosystem of ISVs and SI partners that can help us take this to market and expand our scale. So it’s still early days, but I’m excited about where this is going.Pinjalim Bora: Yes, understood. Thank you. And one for Rukmini. Rukmini, you talked about ATR slowing this year. Maybe help us understand why would that be the case? Is that just because that ACV was a little bit slower this year? Is that kind of adding up to it? And then are you baking in any upside from the VMware opportunity in the guidance?Rukmini Sivaraman: Hi, Pinjalim, thank you for the question. So on the first question on ATR. So we expect continued growth in our renewal ACV business in fiscal year ‘24 and our GRR continues to be good at 90% plus. But as you noted and as we said in our prepared remarks, we do expect that the renewal ACV will – is expected to grow at a slower rate in fiscal ‘24 than in ‘23 due to the shifting of some renewals from ‘24 to ‘23, largely due to co-terming and some natural variation, right, that we see, the timing of renewals as customers choose to renew based on their budget cycles or other factors. In fiscal year ‘25, we expect renewals to go to reaccelerate based on our current view of our available to renew or ATR.And I think it’s important to emphasize also that we continue to believe that this growing mix of renewals over time as a proportion of our total billings continues to be a driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. And I think your second question, Pinjalim, was around have we baked in any benefit from VMware spending acquisition by Broadcom, and so we continue to see significant engagement and opportunities related to potential concerns around that transaction. And in Q4, we did see a few of these opportunities close including a 7-figure ACV deal with the 1400 company. So while it’s difficult to predict the timing of these wins as we’ve talked about before, just because of some of the dynamics in the market, we do expect some benefit from these deals influenced by this transaction and have factored that into our guidance.Pinjalim Bora: Got it. Thank you very much.Rukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.Operator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.Jim Fish: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Nice guide. I’d also see the new customers pick up again, understanding there is some seasonality here. But was anything causing that in particular in this environment to see the 500 net new customers, including anything on the competitive front to the last question and I appreciate the details on the net retention rate in the quarter here. But can you walk us through kind of how we should be thinking about net retention into next year, given kind of what’s going on with retention rates? And does this mean with the cash flow guide being close to $300 million of this year that we could be thinking about well north of $300 million for fiscal ‘25 or is that just an Analyst Day item that we should be patient for?Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think there are three questions there, Jim. Maybe I’ll take the first two, which is around new logos and the competitive outlook, and then Rukmini can focus on the financial questions. So on the new logos, we continue to focus on these higher quality, higher ASP new logos. Most of them just new logo account. But seasonally, of course, Q4 is a strong quarter for us and vis-à-vis earlier that you saw the strength and new logos there, relatively speaking. It’s also we’re focusing on larger, more strategic transactions, and we are seeing success on that front, certainly. So that’s the new logo piece. From a competitive perspective, you already talked about the VMware dynamic there. Clearly, we’ve seen the engagement level grow there.Clearly, we’ve seen some deals starting to close. And there is still a lot of variability in terms of how the pendulum is going to swing on this one from customers who might just use us to get at a lower price from VMware to customers who truly see us about bringing a second [indiscernible], reducing their risk with an alternative provider. So we’ll have to see how that plays out. The hydro cloud piece is really starting to work in terms of customers using more of us in the public cloud. So that piece of it is working well. Our partnership with the hyperscalers is actually coming through actually also nicely in that regard. So we feel good about our competitive positioning as we get into FY ‘24. Rukmini, you can perhaps address the NRR and other questions?Rukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Yes. Hi, Jim, so on NRR, we were happy with the 1.3% that we reported for fiscal year ‘23. And in terms of fiscal year ‘24, Jim, what I say is I think you should still assume that part or sort of new and expansion business, the majority does come from expansion, like we talked about that before. We’re not giving out a specific number today, Jim, but more color to come on that at our Investor Day. And similarly, on free cash flow, yes, we’re happy to sort of guide to $280 million to $300 million for fiscal year ‘24 and again, more to comment at Investor Day. What I will say, though, is we continue to be focused on all elements of that profitable growth piece, which means that we do intend to continue to evolve our – grow our margins, free cash flow margins over time, while growing the top line, right? So that continues to be the intent, but I’ll sort of hold on any specific free cash flow outlook beyond ‘24 for our Investor Day.Jim Fish: Fair enough. Just last one for me, Rajiv, on that Cisco partnership, I mean, how much demand were you getting for this? Just nice to have as Cisco UCS is a much smaller shareholder of that server market relative to some of your other partners and understanding Cisco has one of the best sales motions out there with this. But are there any minimums to think about or how should we expect the impact probably more for fiscal ‘25, but any impact for fiscal ‘24?Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So again, let me pass it out there. So Jim, first of all, yes, we have seen customer requests in the past for customers. There are many large customers with UCS deployments. They would like to see this joint solution from us and Cisco. So we’re happy that we’re able to announce that. Also importantly for us, the fact is Cisco has a go-to-market machine that’s much bigger than ours. We today have about 20 – call it about 25,000 customers roughly but our addressable market in terms of customers are at least 100,000. And so Cisco’s broad market reach could help us get those initial entries. And again, we’re going to work, co-sell with Cisco. Cisco is going to be the front in terms of selling this but we’re going to be helping them along the way.And just I look at this as an expansion opportunity for us with a much larger customer base. Good for the customer in terms of them buying an integrated solution for everything they need in the data center, right? There’s a virtual platform, cloud platform from us, hardware from Cisco, both in terms of servers and storage as well as the networking features and the security aspects of this. So we are excited about this. Now in terms of the numbers, what we expect is we just literally announced it here. And we – there’s a whole process of training, enabling the fee etcetera. So we are factoring in a small amount in the later half of this year, like more likely in our Q4, but we certainly expect the momentum to build here over time.Jim Fish: Congrats, guys. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.Meta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe just as a first question, understanding kind of the new customer cohort you guys have said is kind of a focus on higher quality and larger customers. Is there any way to quantify, just in terms of what that cohort – just in terms of kind of initial deal size or anything that kind of makes the point on that metric? And then just on kind of the re-acceleration and kind of general elongation of sales cycles right now, do you think that, that is kind of a the catalyst for that reverting in fiscal ‘25 is purely macro? Do you need to kind of see more multi-cloud spending? Like what is it, just a matter of macro? Or what kind of do you think is the main catalyst for that re-acceleration? Thanks.Rajiv Ramaswami: Let me take a crack at the first part and Rukmini can add on. So our new ASP for these new logo ASPs are certainly up year-over-year for us given the focus. We haven’t put a number on it, but perhaps one of the things we could do, take that as an action for our Investor Day to come back to you with looking at, for example, how many customers we have with over $1 million, for example of ARR. So we – it’s a good question, we will come back to you with more color. But in general, yes, new logo ASPs have been going up as a result of our focus. Rukmini, do you want to take the rest?Rukmini Sivaraman: Sure. Yes. Meta, thanks for the question. So I think you had a couple of things in the – woven into your question, Meta. So one was, I think, around just sort of sales cycles, right, which as we’ve talked about in the past, continues to – we continue to see a modest elongation there, and that is really affecting only our sort of new and expansion business, right? And so that’s sort of what we continue to see and some of those macro factors are factored into our ‘24 outlook in the new and expansion portion. Now – and then you referenced the acceleration that we talked about in ‘24 as it relates to our renewal ACV growth rate. So just again, to reemphasize, the renewals ACV will continue to grow year-over-year for a while as we’ve talked about in the past.What we said was at ‘24, renewal ACV growth is at a slower pace than ‘23 because of the some timing variations between ‘23 and ‘24 due to some co-terming, but also largely due to just some timing as it relates to when customers choose to make their purchases because of their budget cycles and so on. And so we view that as effect in ‘24. But when we look at the available to renewal pool for ‘25, we see that reacceleration in ‘25. So that’s what we were referencing. And I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the new and expansion portion versus the renewals, which I hope that answers your question.Meta Marshall: Yes. No, that’s perfect. Thank you.Rukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.Operator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham. Your line is now open.Mike Cikos: Thank you. Thanks for getting me on the line here. I did want to come back to the ACV billings for a second. And I know that – congrats on the outperformance on the guidance. I believe you guys have cited outperformance stemming from specifically renewals when I think about the ACV billings. What drove that outperformance? Can you put some finer parameters around it, whether it would be – it sounds like macro was relatively stable, but was it just better execution, potentially conservatism for the guide? Like how do we view the different pieces that contributed to the outperformance you guys were able to generate?Rukmini Sivaraman: Hi Mike. Thanks for the question. So, there were maybe a couple of components that I will talk to, and I welcome Rajiv to add anything else that you would like. So, the first one is that around renewals, right, what we say when we mean renewals outperformed is that we see some core earnings, as we have talked about before, which is sometimes more difficult to forecast. And we are also seeing continued improving discipline around renewals economics, which is what we transact the renewals as compared to sort of what the original transaction was, right. So, those are the ones that are contributing to improvement in renewals outperformance. And so that was a big driver, I would say, Mike, the outperformance in ACV billings. So, that was really the largest driver of outperformance for Q4 ACV billings.Mike Cikos: Great. And I guess a two quarter on a follow-up. One, kind of fees-up the ACV billings again. But if I think about the guidance that we have today for Q1 ACV billings, it’s actually down sequentially. And if I look over the most recent 2 years, you have gone up from Q4 to Q1. Can you help us think about why it would be down sequentially, maybe part of it has to do with this co-terming effect or maybe some of those deals that came in, in Q4 from let’s say, the VMware deal that we cited earlier, that can you guys – that’s the first question, as far as the ACV billing guide being down in Q1 sequentially. The second is gross margins. I know we cited a benefit from non-recurring savings and the timing of hiring.Can you help us unpack what – or quantify what the non-recurring savings were or what that dollar figure was and then the timing of hiring, I guess we should expect for you guys to hire into that in the out year, or is this – this is hiring that’s been – you guys can actually prove more efficient versus what you had initially anticipated?Rukmini Sivaraman: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Let me take that one-by-one. So, on the Q4 to Q1, our typical seasonality is actually Q1 being lower than Q4, Mike, typically, because Q4 is a seasonally high quarter for us given it’s the year-end, right. And it’s sort of – sellers are motivated, right, to go and have a good Q4. Last year was a bit of an anomaly, right. Because if you recall in Q4 ‘22, we saw some of this impact from supply chain disruptions that were affecting our partners and therefore, are also impacting us to some degree, right. So, the Q4 ‘22 number was actually probably artificially lower, which led to a sequential increase last year. This is more normal, is how I would characterize that, Mike. And then to your question on gross margin, so we said a few things there.So, one was revenue higher than expected, I think that’s straightforward. And your question was on the other two. So, what we say when we mean timing of hiring is as sort of attrition happens, normal levels of attrition, but sometimes it takes time to backfill and so on, right. So, that can sometimes cross quarter boundaries. And so we saw some of that in Q4. Those people we would expect to be hired and backfill in short order here, right, so really probably in Q1. And the non-recurring savings were not huge amounts, Mike. But just remember that I think Q4 also is a high gross margin here as well because COGS and operating expenses don’t fluctuate as much over the year, but Q2 and Q4 are seasonally higher top line quarters for us, right.So, you will see that those margins tick up higher in Q2 and Q4 and take a little bit lower in Q1 and Q3, which is why if you look at our overall fiscal year ‘24 guide, we are saying gross margin is approximately in that 84% range.Mike Cikos: Thank you very much. I really appreciate all the color. Thank you.Rukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Mike.Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from George Wang from Barclays. Your line is now open.George Wang: Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter. I just want to ask about any update on the repatriation trends, especially given definitely macro, are you guys seeing sort of increased repatriation to on-prem, which may benefit your tenants?Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, George, I can’t say that we have seen increased repatriation as well. We have certainly seen instances of repatriation. What I would say is interesting is that we have also seen stuff in the other direction, which is people have committed to some of these large public cloud spend commitments. And what they are saying, they are not able to get their applications really to public cloud as quickly as they would like to see and so they are now stuck with saying, I have to spend this much money in the public cloud because I committed to it already. And so we have seen that come to us because now they are looking at this saying, we are available through the marketplace of Azure and AWS. And we have seen people purchasing our software through the Azure and AWS marketplace, which help them retire some of their commitment in public spend.So, yes, I think we see the world being hybrid, some work loads are being repatriated from the public cloud. I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily a wholesale trend, we see that in spots versus a systemic trend yet at this point. But the world is very much hybrid, people are being much more conscious about how much to put in the public cloud in the first place.George Wang: Okay. Great. Just a quick follow-up, if I can, we simplified portfolio kind of platform approach. Can you talk about kind of the tax rate to Nutanix Cloud Platform, Cloud Manager and the kind of maybe high-level commentary on cross-sell and up-sell?Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, I think two questions there. On the attach rate of the portfolio, for sure, the biggest change that we have seen since we launched our revised portfolio with much higher attach for cloud management along with our cloud infrastructure. In fact, that is the easiest attach sale, really, right. Everybody who built the cloud also wants to operate the cloud. So, naturally attaching cloud operations, cloud management to our infrastructure. That’s the best we have seen. We have also seen, of course, NC2, which is our public cloud extension is a natural extension, natural attach and it’s really – it ties together with our cloud platform very nicely. So, that’s another attach that is still relatively small for us, but growing every quarter in terms of customers, number of customers and customer accounts.Unified storage is the other element of the portfolio that we see reasonable attach with as well. The one that we have to actually really work with a specialist team to sell is our Nutanix database portfolio because that’s largely sold a level up in the stack to the people who are either managing databases or at developers that requires more specialist skills, and that’s much more of a specialist.George Wang: Okay. Great. Thanks. Congrats again.Rajiv Ramaswami: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open.Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to your fiscal year ‘24 guide. If I just take the midpoint, it seems like OpEx would need to grow by 7% and I understand you honestly, it’s coming, but would the collaboration or the deal with Cisco actually help? Is some of these OpEx growth assumptions built into the model, or does that order be bake into account, or do that account for any cost savings as Cisco scales your product…?Rukmini Sivaraman: Hi Mehdi. Thank you for that question. So, let me first address the OpEx point, then we will talk about any potential impact from Cisco. So, if you look at our operating expense profile over the last several years, since about 3 years ago, it was about $1.5 billion and last year it was $1.4 billion, right. It was actually, we have kind of really kept it sort of flat to down over the last 3 years, while of course continuing to grow ACV billings, the ARR revenue and so on since over that time. So, we have been really sort of cautious about OpEx and then focusing on improved efficiency and productivity. Where we are now is that we are making some very prudent, I would say and targeted investments in our go-to-market and in our innovation engine.As we talked about, our market, we believe is large and growing in order to go and capitalize on that. So, we are making some targeted investments on that front. Now, on the Cisco piece, I think what we expect the Cisco partnership for us to do is to continue to help sort of our productivity go up and really be additive to our overall top line, right. So, that’s how we should think about operating expenses relative to last year, but also relative to any potential impact on Cisco.Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And one follow-up for Rajiv, I just want to go back to your prepared remarks. And I am just trying to better understand, I kind of agree with you that security, privacy, compliance would actually bode well for enterprises to scale AI. But as you think about the train models moving from a cloud infrastructure into on-prem, would that actually require your existing or prospective customer with additional one-time CapEx investment or no?Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, that depends on what they have – I mean obviously, this AI requires compute resources, right. It requires several platforms with GPUs attached to it. So clearly, these are new workloads for the customer, they are going to have to buy new hardware, right, so – and put our software on it. What they would do, just to clarify what they would do, the models likely are combinational models that are trained on publicly available data in the public cloud. But then when they bring it on-prem, they are going to fine tune this, and potentially make it more compact with their own specific data. A good example just to see how this works, maybe it’s – take support as an example, even after the support, in terms of support, we have a lot of internal documentation that we don’t put in the public cloud, internal design documents as well.So, imagine using a generative AI back end to be able to go through all of that and quickly try and arrive at root cause or try and arrive at answers to customer support questions. So, we want to run that on-prem or in a secure location where our data is stored. And so we will typically run that on, again, standard servers with GPU accelerators, running DJI models with our stack.Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Is that where Cisco could come in and actually become a partner to facilitate that additional investment required?Rajiv Ramaswami: I think the Cisco piece, by the way, just let me – I think we should decouple that, right, because this AI piece works with everybody servers. So, customers can buy servers from Dell or HP or Lenovo or any of server partners and we have a wide variety of them, and we have been supporting GPUs for multiple years. So, we don’t necessarily need this to be only Cisco. So, they can buy that from whoever they like their server partners. What we expect with Cisco is a significant expansion in terms of our go-to-market reach, right, with their go-to-market, their ability to sell into a much broader customer base and their footprint, we should be able to benefit from that in the long-term.Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you for the color.Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your line is now open.Erik Suppiger: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. First off, on the GPT-in-a-Box, are those customers developing their own large language model or are they using third-party software on that box? And then secondly, in the – go ahead.Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Erik, I think the answer that most of them would not build their own large language models. They would use foundation models that are available. For example, there is new ones coming out like Lama 2 [ph] that are open source. They could, of course, use GPT if they like as well. But there are much of the models. Most customers in the enterprise, I don’t think will develop their own models, but use what’s available out there. They would probably fine tune it with the data that they have.Erik Suppiger: Okay. That makes sense. And then secondly, in the partnership with Cisco, are the Cisco sales getting comped on selling the Nutanix software?Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes, they are getting compensated just as if they were selling Cisco products, so 100% compensation for their service.Erik Suppiger: Very good. Okay. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.Ruplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. It’s Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I had one question for Rajiv and one for Rukmini. Rajiv, can you comment on a couple of things to specifically demand by vertical. You talked about some share gains this quarter. How is the pricing environment? Is that holding steady, or are you seeing any pricing pressure? And then can you talk about your view on the backlog heading into fiscal ‘24, has that normalized now, or is it still elevated?Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, on the pricing, we haven’t seen any significant change in pricing this quarter compared to our last quarter. And in general, as we, for example, attach more of our products with our portfolio towards these, ASPs tend to go up, right, because we are simply attaching more of the portfolio. So, we haven’t seen any shift or big change in our pricing dynamics. Now, on the backlog and with respect to verticals, again, I can’t say that there is any significant difference. I think it’s more a function of volume and deal size that dictates discounts and rather than any particular vertical related factors for us. Now, with respect to the backlog, I am going to let Rukmini comment on that.Rukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Thank you, Rajiv and hi Ruplu. So, on backlog, as we talked about I think last year for fiscal year ‘23, backlog, it did move around as expected during the course of fiscal year ‘23. Despite that, we ended ‘23 actually with a slight increase and that should impact backlog dollars year-over-year. And we are factoring that into the outlook for fiscal year ‘24. So, we expect some backlog to be consumed over the course of this year. But as is to be expected in an uncertain macro environment like the one we are in, I think the range of possible outcomes are just wider than before. And more generally, as we continue to grow, the absolute dollar number of backlog could also continue to increase over time.Ruplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details there. If I can ask you, looking at the guidance for fiscal 1Q versus the full year fiscal ‘24, it looks like there is operating margin improvement as you go through the year. So, what are the drivers for that? And then if you can talk about the seasonality you expect in ACV billings. Again, looking to – should we think that going from 2Q to 3Q, should we expect the same level of decline, your renewables business is growing. So, just any thoughts on how should we model ACV billings in fiscal ‘24? Thank you.Rukmini Sivaraman: Okay. So, there were a couple of questions there. I think the first one was on Q1 operating margin versus full year and so I think I will just remind folks that, again, Q2 and Q4 are seasonally in general, seasonally a stronger quarter for us. Q2 because you have December in there, which is annual budget flush for many customers. And so Q2 is stronger for that reason and Q4 is our fiscal year-end. And so Q2 and Q4 seasonally strong quarters, which means that margins, although operating expenses and cost of goods sold don’t vary as much, the top line does look stronger in Q2 and Q4, and therefore, margins in general also tend to look stronger in Q2 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q3, right. So, that’s sort of one call out on the margin piece on the full year versus 1Q.And then on seasonality, I think was your second question, Ruplu. More generally, I would just say, I think as I have said, you should expect some seasonality in top line for a slight decline between 2Q to 3Q and that follows sort of a new and expansion. Therefore, generally, renewals ATR also does follow that pattern as well. And to the extent we expect any variation in that, we will make sure to call that out. But as of now, you should still expect somewhat fairly normal patterns we can talk to that.Ruplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details.Rukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you and congrats on a strong quarter, you had another one. That’s fantastic. And nice to see the buyback being announced, could you talk about what is the priority of allocating capital to buyback growth to, say, paying down debt?Rukmini Sivaraman: Yes, sure. So, I will just talk more generally and our focus continues to be on sustainable profitable growth, as we have said and we continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments into our go-to-market innovation engine, as I have said earlier, in response to another question. We are happy to have generated over $200 million of cash – of cash flow last year and have $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And so we think of this share repurchase authorization as a reflection of the confidence in our long-term financial outlook by returning capital to shareholders while ensuring that we have optionality to continue to invest in growth and to our other strategic priorities. And to your question on paying down debt and how we do take a look at that, of course we look at all of the alternative uses of our cash before making any decision.And our public convert, we pay 25 basis points on those, and they are not due for another few years. And so it made sense for us to think about that more holistically and sort of we believe that doing the share repurchase authorization is sort of the best use of our cash, given all of the other options available to us.Nehal Chokshi: So, what’s your anticipation of the pace of utilization of that buyback authorization then?Rukmini Sivaraman: We have not given a specific timeframe, Nehal, and authorization does not have an expiration date. And so the timing and amounts will depend on a variety of factors, as you can imagine, right, including just business conditions, stock prices and other factors and so I will leave that there.Nehal Chokshi: Would it be fair to say that you want to return a certain percentage of free cash flow on a go-forward basis?Rukmini Sivaraman: We are not giving out sort of a certain percentage at this point, Nehal. But we will just talk more generally about capital allocation and how we plan to use our cash at our Investor Day as well, right. So, I would be happy to sort of take more – we talk more about that then. But at this point, we are not committing to a specific percentage.Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. Thank you and congrats.Rukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

(CSCO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-attracting-130010259.html,1693573210,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +7.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has gained 9.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $1.03 per share, indicating a change of +19.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.05 points to a change of +4.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.21 indicates a change of +4% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $57.74 billion and $58.88 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $15.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.04%. The EPS surprise was +7.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
