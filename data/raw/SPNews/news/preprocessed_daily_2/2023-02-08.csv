1,59af8a67-503a-3916-a2a4-62c0aae4253a,SCHW,2023-02-08,The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) insiders sold US$113m worth of stock last year which shareholders may not want to overlook,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-corporation-nyse-schw-120119963.html,1675857679,STORY,['SCHW'],"[While The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders have enjoyed a good week with stock up 3.8%, they need remain vigilant. Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$113m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabThe Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$81.19). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.2% of Charles Schwab's holding.In total, Charles Schwab insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. In total, Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab dumped US$21m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Charles Schwab insiders own 5.6% of the company, currently worth about US$8.6b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that Charles Schwab is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Charles Schwab that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Charles Schwab may not be the best stock to buy.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Charles Schwab, FNDX has amassed assets over $10.73 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. FNDX, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index.The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for FNDX, making it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesFNDX's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.93%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 17.10% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 3.55% of the fund's total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 19.12% of FNDX's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added about 7.13% and is up roughly 0.42% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 02/08/2023), respectively. FNDX has traded between $47.76 and $59.62 during this last 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 25.44% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDX a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 725 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $53.96 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $104.94 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Cisco Systems (CSCO) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.87 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 15, 2023.Cisco Systems' Earnings ESP sits at 1.66%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.87 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86.CSCO is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Texas Instruments (TXN) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Texas Instruments, which is readying to report earnings on April 25, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.76 a share, and TXN is 77 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesTexas Instruments' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.36% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CSCO and TXN could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

8,fe7e8ab9-f424-3f54-ab7b-be6da74fa44a,TMO,2023-02-08,Catalent (CTLT) Surges on Rumors of Acquisition by Danaher,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/catalent-ctlt-surges-rumors-acquisition-150903561.html,1675782543,STORY,"['CTLT', 'DHR', 'JNJ', 'TMO']","[Shares of Catalent CTLT gained 19.5% on Monday on rumors of a potential acquisition by a life sciences company — Danaher DHR. The CTLT stock started its upward journey during pre-market trading on Feb 6, following a Bloomberg report on DHR’s interest in taking over the contract development and manufacturing company (CDMO).Per the same report, Bloomberg claims that Danaher has valued Catalent at a significant premium but hasn’t disclosed it yet. The expectation of a premium valuation for the CDMO company is likely to have sparked investors’ sentiments, causing a nearly 20% gain in stock price for CTLT in the last trading session.However, the report also states that it remains uncertain about any imminent acquisition deal and whether Catalent will be interested in any sale of its business.In the past three months, shares of Catalent have gained 56.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 14.2%. The S&amp;P 500 Index was up 8.3% in the period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSignificance of an AcquisitionCatalent has placed itself as a reliable CDMO partner for pharmaceutical/drug-maker companies in the past few years, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak. The company had formed partnerships with multiple COVID-19 vaccine makers — Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Moderna and AstraZeneca. Catalent provided several services supporting the speedy rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, Danaher has relied on inorganic activities to boost its competency. The company acquired several companies in the past couple of years to gain a strong foothold in the life sciences field. It is also planning to spin out its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segment to focus more on its core Life Sciences segment. Hence, addition of a CDMO company like Catalent looks in line with DHR’s goals. The acquisition may also help Danaher in becoming a one-stop solution for biopharma companies and competing well with its near competitor —  Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.Story continuesWe note that Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of the key players in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. TMO had already integrated a CDMO company — Patheon — that it acquired in 2017.Recent Key M&amp;A DealsMerger and acquisition deals (M&amp;A) had been slow last year with deals and their size declining year over year. However, the fourth quarter of 2022 saw two major M&amp;A offers — the acquisition of Abiomed by J&amp;J for $16.6 billion and the buyout of Horizon Therapeutics by Amgen for $27.8 billion. JNJ completed its acquisition in December last year, while Amgen’s deal is expected to be closed in the first half of 2023.After a dry patch of M&amp;A activities last year, the two blockbuster deals have boosted investors’ sentiments for an anticipated rise in M&amp;A activities in 2023. If all parties agree, a potential offer from Danaher for Catalent will also be a major deal as the latter is currently valued at approximately $12 billion.Catalent, Inc. PriceCatalent, Inc.

9,2411ea0b-314c-30d5-bf30-3b0ccf612165,USB,2023-02-08,U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 70% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-largely-140028063.html,1675778428,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 70% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of U.S. Bancorp, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$122m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over U.S. Bancorp. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 3.3% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  U.S. Bancorp is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the returns of dividend growers, and go directly to read 5 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future. Dividend Kings are companies that have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. Due to consistent interest rates hike and growing inflation, investors are steadily loading up on dividend securities to ensure regular income. Moreover, these stocks also offer potential for capital appreciation as the stock price increases over time. When considering dividend stocks, investors focus on companies that hold extended track records of dividend growth. West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some companies that have been rewarding investors with growing dividends for decades.Dividend-growing stocks perform well during inflation as increased income can protect investors’ purchasing power. Various reports revealed that dividend growers exhibited strong performance during previous inflationary periods. The S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation since 2000, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report cited S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Bureau of Economic Analysis data and mentioned that dividends now represent 7.3% of personal income, up from 3.2% in 1980. Another report by ClearBridge Investments showed that dividend growers delivered an annual average return of 11.1% in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 to Q3 2022, versus a 9.2% return of the broader market. Similarly, in 12 months before the Fed rate hike during the same period, dividend growers returned 21.4%, compared with a 15.7% return of the S&amp;P 500.Another important factor worth considering is the payout ratios of dividend companies. This is important to measure the proportion of the company’s earnings that is paid out as dividends to shareholders. Moreover, it also shows the financial health of the company and the stability of its future dividends. Generally, companies with payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have sufficient cash flow generation to fulfill shareholder obligations.Story continuesIn view of this, we will discuss companies that are likely to be dividend kings in the future.10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the FutureOur Methodology:For this article, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for 29 years or more. From that list, we selected companies that have a 5-year average dividend payout ratio of less than 50%, which shows the stability of their future dividends. This also indicates that these companies allocate a healthy portion of their earnings in dividend payouts. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.10.

In January, BMO Capital initiated its coverage on the stock with a Market Perform rating and a $225 price target. The firm expects the company's margins to improve this year.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) reported net premiums of $10.55 billion, which showed a 13.2% growth from the same period last year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”9. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $0.63 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 15%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.32 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Xylem shares have lost about 5.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.1%.What's Next for Xylem?While Xylem has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Xylem: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because MGM Resorts is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MGM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of $1.47 per share for MGM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.60 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MGM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +8.41% heading into earnings season.MGM Resorts International Price and EPS SurpriseMGM Resorts International Price and EPS SurpriseMGM Resorts International price-eps-surprise | MGM Resorts International QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial (HIG) and Old Republic International ORI.Industry: Insurance - MultilineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2050394/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-multiline-insurance-industryProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., The Hartford Financial and Old Republic International. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With seven hikes in interest rate in 2022, already one this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services.Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products as well as exposure to intangible assets offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas.With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte. However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk.The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bright outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by the analysts for the current year.Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 6.1% in the past year compared with the Finance sector’s increase of 4.8%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite declined 0.7% in the same time frame.Current ValuationOn the basis of its trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 3.02X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.77X and the sector’s 3.63X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 3.14X, as low as 0.84X and at the median of 1.6X.5 Multiline Insurance Stocks to Keep an Eye OnWe are presenting one Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, three Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks and one Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock from the Multiline Insurance industry.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Old Republic International: Based in Chicago, IL, Old Republic is the third-largest title insurer engaged in the insurance underwriting and related services business, primarily in the United States and Canada.

This compares to earnings of $1.95 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.73%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this advertising company would post earnings of $1.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.77, delivering a surprise of 7.93%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Omnicom , which belongs to the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $3.87 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.94%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.86 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Omnicom shares have added about 11.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.1%.What's Next for Omnicom?While Omnicom has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Omnicom: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

In 2022, operating expenses include charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine of $113.4 million. In 2021, operating expenses were favorably impacted by a $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with dispositions in the Advertising &amp; Media discipline. The weakening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar reduced operating expenses for 2022 as compared to the prior year in line with the percentage reduction from changes in foreign currencies on revenue.Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, are comprised of salary and related costs, and third-party service costs.  In total, salary and service costs decreased $76.1 million, or 0.7%, to $10,325.9 million.  Salary and related costs increased $226.9 million, or 3.3%, to $7,197.9 million due to organic revenue growth and increased headcount.

Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with dispositions in the Advertising &amp; Media discipline. Non-GAAP Adjusted operating profit increased 2.3%, and the related margin increased to 15.4% from 15.0%.Interest Expense, netNet interest expense in 2022 decreased $71.2 million to $137.9 million compared to 2021.  Interest expense decreased $27.8 million to $208.6 million, and interest income increased $43.4 million to $70.7 million, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on cash balances and short-term investments.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate of 28.1% in 2022 increased from 24.6% in 2021.  The higher effective tax rate for 2022 was primarily due to the result of the non-deductibility of $113.4 million in charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as an additional increase in income tax expense of $4.8 million related to the disposition of our businesses in Russia. These charges were partially offset by the tax benefit arising from our share-based compensation awards. The effective tax rate for 2021 reflects a nominal tax applied to the book gain on the disposition in the Advertising &amp; Media discipline resulting from the excess of tax over book basis and a reduction in income tax expense of $32.8 million primarily related to the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions.Net Income – Omnicom Group Inc. and Diluted Net Income per ShareNet income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2022 decreased $91.3 million, or 6.5%, to $1,316.5 million compared to 2021.

Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with dispositions in the Advertising &amp; Media discipline.Risks and UncertaintiesGlobal economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, rising interest rates and supply-chain disruptions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We monitor economic conditions closely, as well as client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments.Definitions - Components of Revenue ChangeWe use certain terms in describing the components of the change in revenue above.Foreign exchange rate impact: calculated by translating the current period's local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue. The foreign exchange rate impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue.Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue: Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition date is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of disposals through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the description above.Organic growth: calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact component and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue component from total revenue growth.Conference CallOmnicom will host a conference call to review its financial results on Tuesday, February 7, 2023 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

44,80299121-9dee-34a4-9153-27056a370e28,FE,2023-02-08,Earnings Preview: Exelon (EXC) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-exelon-exc-q4-150003734.html,1675782003,STORY,"['EXC', 'EXCVV', 'FE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Exelon (EXC) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -52.2%.Revenues are expected to be $4.52 billion, down 53.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon?For Exelon, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of +4.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Exelon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, FirstEnergy (FE), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.53 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.84 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for FirstEnergy has been revised 7.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FirstEnergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

47,58374747-8fe8-3a6d-a062-00ce79abbaf6,SEE,2023-02-08,Q&A with Sealed Air's Global Operations Excellence Director,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q-sealed-airs-global-operations-140000496.html,1675778400,STORY,['SEE'],"[Originally published in Sealed Air's Global Impact ReportNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 7, 2023 / Andrei Stoddard, Global Operations Excellence Director, has been with Sealed Air (SEE) for 42 years. He is focused on collaborating across functions to drive strategic initiatives that ensure SEE meets its environmental sustainability goals and building the roadmap to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.What does SEE operational excellence mean?There are significant challenges of which we need to be mindful for how they impact our people, our business, and the environment. We are determined to reach zero emissions, zero waste, and zero harm. Operational excellence is about how we show up every day with an unwavering sense of purpose that we will overcome those challenges, continue to make improvements, and achieve our goals. Through operational excellence we are doing our part to make sure we are manufacturing responsibly. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our people while we increase our manufacturing productivity and delivery of solutions that are essential to global supply chains and address the needs of communities around the world. We invest in renewable energy and preserve resources by focusing on reducing water and energy use, and we make sure we are preventing waste from going to landfill. We have proven our abilities to solve complex challenges inside of our business, and we intend to keep doing it.What are some of the benefits of SEE's new solar farm? Our solar project is an important renewable energy milestone for SEE. Located in central California, which gets an average of 5.5 hours of direct sun each day, SEE's Madera site was the perfect place for our foray into solar. The panels provide 98% of the facility's electricity. Over the course of the first year, the solar farm will help avoid 4,982 metric tons of carbon dioxide and 72,172 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 15 years.What sustainability accomplishment makes you most proud?We started our sustainability journey in 2012 by setting formal goals for reducing energy, waste, water, and greenhouse gas emissions. We're making great progress towards those goals and have seen measurable improvements year over year that create value for our business and the environment. This consistent improvement is what makes me most proud because it's difficult to achieve and requires a dedicated effort throughout our supply chain.Story continuesI am passionate about working with the people in our manufacturing facilities to generate ideas, put continuous improvement programs in place, and find optimal ways to make SEE better and produce positive impacts. There is a lot of excitement among our employees who contribute to these projects and initiatives throughout all of our manufacturing sites. For more than 30 years, SEE has offered an internal recognition program, Keys to Success, that honors employees for their achievements in driving operational excellence in safety, quality, performance, sustainability, and best practices. We continue to build upon these achievements to transform the way we work and serve our customers.What are some of SEE's employee-led operational excellence projects?There is human ingenuity at SEE. We operate with an entrepreneurial spirit. We make sure there is capacity to explore new ideas and options and make improvements faster. Our facility in Quilmes, Argentina is partnering with local recyclers to keep our products out of landfill by recycling various materials to produce ceiling tiles, trash cans, and park benches. Our facility in QingPu, China is reducing energy consumption by redirecting heat from air compressors to boil water for our processing equipment. In Toluca, Mexico, employees implemented water preservation initiatives and recovery and reuse programs that are reducing the environmental impacts of our business and making positive contributions to the community.Read Sealed Air's Global Impact Report here.Learn more about Sealed Air's ESG efforts here.Sealed Air, Tuesday, February 7, 2023, Press release pictureAndrei Stoddard, Sealed Air's Global Operations Excellence DirectorView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Sealed Air on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Sealed AirWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sealed-airEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Sealed AirView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738373/QA-with-Sealed-Airs-Global-Operations-Excellence-Director]"
48,21046870-433c-3a55-87a6-9d8b5d7797f5,RL,2023-02-08,3 Stocks to Consider Buying Before Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-consider-buying-earnings-004912156.html,1675817352,STORY,"['LYFT', 'EXPE', 'UBER', 'RL']","[Progressing through earnings season this week a few top-rated stocks are reporting from a variety of sectors that investors will want to watch.Here are 3 stocks among the Zacks Retail Wholesale, Computer and Technology, and Consumer Staples sectors that are worthy of consideration before their quarterly reports.Expedia Group (EXPE)Starting the list is online travel company Expedia, which is set to report its Q4 earnings on Thursday, February 9. Expedia is out of the Retail-Wholesale sector and its Internet-Commerce Industry is currently in the top 15% of over 250 Zacks Industries.With travel demand expected to remain robust following the pandemic, Expedia stands to benefit through its web portals that focus on travel planning, travel purchases, and travel experience sharing that brings suppliers and consumers of travel-related services together.Furthermore, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) earnings estimate revisions have gone up 3% over the last quarter for Expedia’s fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out FY22.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Expedia’s Q4 earnings are expected at $1.85 per share, which would be a 74% increase from Q4 2021. Fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected to rebound 350% to $7.44 per share compared to EPS of $1.65 in 2021. Plus, fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to climb another 24% to $9.21 per share. On the top line, Q4 sales are forecasted to be $2.68 billion, up 18% from the prior year quarter. Total sales are now anticipated to be up 36% for FY22 and rise another 9% in FY23 to $12.78 billion. More importantly, Fiscal 2023 sales would be 6% above pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $12.06 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that Expedia could significantly top Q4 bottom-line estimates with the Most Accurate Estimate at $1.99 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $1.85.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesTakeaway: Expedia’s top and bottom line appear to be back on the path to continued growth and the rising earnings estimate revisions for FY23 are an indication that the company could also provide upbeat guidance in its outlook.Even better, Expedia stock is now up +36% to start the year and still trades at just 16.5X forward earnings. This is 56% below its decade-long high of 38X and a 21% discount to the median of 21X, suggesting there could be plenty of upside left in EXPE stock, especially with earnings on the rise.Lyft (LYFT)Another stock investors may want to consider buying this week is ride-hailing company Lyft which is also set to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, February 9.Lyft has remained focused on ride-sharing and building its multimodal transportation network in the United States and Canada while competitor Uber Technologies (UBER) is making a global push and implementing food transportation into its ride-hailing service along with freight transportation services.However, unlike Uber, Lyft is already profitable as its operating costs are a lot lower with its expansion centered around its core business. To that note, Lyft stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates have started to slightly go up again over the last 30 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Lyft’s Q4 EPS is expected at $0.10 a share, up 11% from $0.09 per share in Q4 2021. Even better, this would round out fiscal 2022 earnings at $0.41 per share, compared to EPS of -$0.25 a share in 2021 and FY23 earnings are projected to climb 120% to $0.90 per share.Fourth-quarter sales are forecasted to be $1.16 billion, up 19% from the prior year quarter. Total sales would be up 27% YoY for FY22 and are projected to jump another 19% in FY23 to $4.87 billion. Plus, with 2019 sales at $3.61 billion, FY23 would represent 35% growth from pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: Lyft is expected to top Q4 earnings expectations with The Zacks Consensus at $0.10 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus at $0.14 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Considering Lyft’s bottom line is already in the black, its stock looks very attractive at around $17 per share with Uber stock in comparison at $33 per share. While the traditional P/E valuation metric is not able to be used for Lyft or Uber stock yet, it is noteworthy that Lyft’s price to sales is more attractive at 1.2X Vs. Uber’s 1.8X and is also well below the S&amp;P 500’s 3.5X.Lastly, a strong Q4 earnings beat could continue to spark Lyft’s stock which has now rallied 83% off its December lows with shares up 62% YTD to crush the broader indexes’ strong start to the new year. Ralph Lauren (RL) Rounding out the list is premium apparel retailer Ralph Lauren out of the Consumer Staples sector which is set to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings on February 9.As a leading international designer, marketer, and distributor of clothing, footwear, accessories, and home furnishings among other product categories RL stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with annual earnings estimates trending higher again leading up to its quarterly report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Preview: Ralph Lauren’s fiscal Q3 earnings are expected at $2.91 per share, which would be a -1% dip from Q3 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are now projected to decline -7% to $7.75 per share compared to EPS of $8.38 in 2022.However, fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to rebound and climb 14% to $8.86 per share. On the top line, Q3 sales are forecasted to be $1.75 billion, down -3% from the prior year quarter. Total sales are now forecasted to be virtually flat in FY23 but rise 5% in FY24 to $6.58 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that Ralph Lauren could top its fiscal Q3 bottom-line estimates with the Most Accurate Estimate at $2.95 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $2.91.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: With Ralph Lauren’s stock trading attractively relative to its past from a valuation standpoint, a strong earnings beat would be a nice catalyst and could lead to more upside. Shares of Ralph Lauren have rallied 14% to start the year topping the S&amp;P 500’s +7% with RL stock trading at 15.6X forward earnings and well below its decade-long high of 242.3X and 10% beneath the median of 17.4X.Bottom Line These three stocks offer diversification in investment portfolios across multiple sectors and appear to have more upside left despite their strong performances to start 2023. The possibility of topping bottom-line expectations is also intriguing as strong earnings beats could be a further catalyst for Expedia, Lyft, and Ralph Lauren stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.62 billion.

Shares have added about 3.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.1%.What's Next for V.F.While V.F.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for V.F. Mixed.

Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRalph Lauren Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteRalph Lauren has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand and expansion across all channels and regions. The company’s strategy of product elevation, acquisition of full-priced consumers, favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to have supported AUR growth in the quarter under review.The company’s focus on expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities via investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment bodes well. Strength across owned and wholesale digital channels globally is likely to have been a key growth driver. Some other notable efforts on the online front are virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” endless aisle product availability, the introduction of additional digital sites in key markets, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition.These factors, along with the company’s first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app, are likely to have aided the top line in the quarter under review. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected year-over-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits at cc for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.However, Ralph Lauren has been reeling under the negative impacts of higher freight and global supply-chain delays, which are anticipated to have dented margins in the fiscal third quarter. Also, unfavorable currency fluctuations are likely to have been concerning. The company earlier expected the unfavorable currency to negatively impact revenues by 780 bps, the gross margin by 170 bps and the operating margin by 180 bps in the to-be-reported quarter. These are likely to have impacted the bottom-line performance in the said quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ralph Lauren this time around.

PINS reported mixed fourth-quarter 2022 results, with the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line beating the same. The San Francisco-based Internet content provider recorded year-over-year higher revenues led by an increase in monthly active users and strong results in core and emerging verticals. However, sluggish demand trends in the advertising business and the adverse macroeconomic climate hurt the company's top-line performance.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, the company reported a net income of $17.5 million or 3 cents per share compared to a net income of $174.7 million or 25 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant fall in GAAP earnings, despite a top-line increase, was primarily caused by higher total costs and expenses induced by higher costs in the sales and marketing division.Non-GAAP net income in the reported quarter was $203.1 million or 29 cents per share compared with $339.4 million or 49 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pinterest, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePinterest, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Pinterest, Inc. Quote RevenuesRevenues in fourth-quarter 2022 rose 4% year over year to $877.2 million but missed the consensus estimate of $885 million. The top-line growth was affected by lower revenues in Europe (down 7%) on a reported basis to $123 million driven by foreign exchange headwinds. However, net sales witnessed 5% growth in the United States and Canada, rising to $722 million from $689 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues from the rest of the world were $32 million, up 26% from the year-ago quarter.For full year 2022, Pinterest experienced a 9% top-line expansion with net sales increasing to $2,803 million from $2,578 million in 2021.Pinterest witnessed growth in monthly active users (MAUS) during the quarter. The figure stands at 450 million globally, up 4% year over year. The uptick can be attributed to the company’s continued effort and investment in relevance and personalization of contents. The company witnessed a 14% increase in MAUs of mobile applications worldwide and monetized mobile application users contributed 80% to the company's revenues.Along with the primary verticals, new verticals like travel, automotive, financial services and men's fashion performed strongly. However, the increase in net revenues, which is primarily driven by major U.S. retail advertisers and foreign markets, is partly mitigated by CPG advertisers and small and mid-market advertisers in the United States as they continue to confront challenges from the unfavorable macroeconomic environment.In the fourth quarter, the global average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 1% to $1.96 from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.93. The sluggish growth indicates the persistence of demand softness in the advertisement market. While ARPU in the United States and Canada increased 6% to $7.6, Europe witnessed a decline of 9% to $1.01 from $1.10 in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesOther DetailsIn the December quarter, total costs and expenses amounted to $871.3 million, up around 31% from the prior-year’s figure of $667.2 million. Cost in Sales and marketing surged 66% to $317.3 million. In the reported quarter, research and development expenses rose to $265.2 million from $240.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter's spending increased year over year due to the company's ongoing investments in innovation, including mobile deep linking, entire page optimization, and improved measurement tools and its stronger brand marketing campaign. Also, higher taxes and bad debt expenses impacted the bottom line.Adjusted EBITDA was $195.8 million in fourth-quarter 2022, down from $350.9 million in the year-ago quarter, as the company decided to reallocate its resources, cut back on hiring workers and close some of its underused offices.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityAs of Dec 31, 2022, Pinterest had cash and cash equivalents of $1,611.1 million, with $178.7 million of operating lease liabilities compared with $1,419.7 million of cash and cash equivalents with $209.2 million of operating lease liabilities in the prior year. The company generated $469.2 million of cash from operating activities in 2022 compared to $752.9 million in the previous year.OutlookPinterest expects first-quarter 2023 revenues to grow in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis considering slightly lower foreign exchange headwinds compared with fourth-quarter levels. The company anticipates that non-GAAP operating expenses are likely to decline in low double digits percent sequentially as it does not intend to invest in a brand marketing campaign in the first quarter like it did in fourth quarter. The company also anticipates that the macroeconomic instability will continue to have an impact on its small, medium-sized business and mid-market advertisers, which will cause a weakening of demand from this market segment.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderPinterest currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.6%, on average.The Chicago, IL-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues on the back of growth in both segments — Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. It benefits from the increasing demand for its mission-critical technologies in North America and globally.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, Motorola inked a contract with Lithuanian National Police and Border Guard Service for 2,500 body-worn cameras for use by its security personnel. Its state-of-the-art VB400 body-worn cameras enable the capture of incidents from the start as it offers an automated pre-recording feature. The VideoManager evidence management solution enables a highly advanced solution for protecting the evidence present on video. It also proves useful to officers’ daily workflow. This is likely to have generated incremental revenues during the quarter.In fourth-quarter 2022, Motorola secured the Joint Interoperability Test Command certification from the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency for its Avigilon video security solutions. Its Federal Information Processing Standards-compliant video security and physical access control systems offer an end-to-end unified solution that meets the stringent privacy and security standards of the federal government. Leveraging real-time video analytics to increase the productivity of security personnel, the products facilitate effective monitoring to combat attention fatigue and resource constraints. This helps to secure people, assets and facilities spanning large perimeters of sensitive and high-security areas.Riding on such state-of-the-art products, Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. These systems drive the demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations. These developments are expected to have positively impacted its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Products and Systems Integration segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,647 million. The figure indicates a rise from $1,495 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Services and Software segment’s revenues stands at $889 million, up from $825 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.For the December quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,535 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $2,320 million.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend capture strategy and past performance of high dividend stocks, and go directly to read Dividend Capture Strategy: 5 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in February. Dividend capture strategy is one of the most popular techniques employed by short-term investors. The strategy involves buying dividend stocks before their ex-dividend dates and selling them after receiving the payouts. Investors often follow this technique because it offers the potential for price appreciation. If the stock price increases after the payout, the investor can sell the stock for a profit. Moreover, this strategy can be a source to generate stable income in a short time, especially if the dividends are above-average.Dividend stocks’ returns over the years have shown their solid performance during inflationary periods. According to a report by AMG Funds, dividend payments of the S&amp;P 500 Index have grown at an annual average rate of 6% over the past five decades, which is well above the inflation rate in the US. The report cited data from Ned Davis Research and mentioned that since 1979, dividend-payers outplayed non-dividend companies in periods where 10-year Treasury was rising.When following a dividend investment strategy, investors seek stocks with healthy yields in order to supplement their income. Moreover, these securities also have a potential for capital appreciation and can help investors diversify their portfolios. In 2021, high-yield dividend stocks in the US Total Cap outperformed non-dividend payers by 39.6%, as reported by IHS Markit. Similarly, high-dividend stocks performed better than non-dividend stocks in developed Europe during the same year. In addition to dividend yields, shareholders also evaluate these stocks in light of the respective company’s financial health, growth prospects, and future dividend policy. With decades-long dividend growth streaks under their belt, dividend growers become investors’ top choices when the market is uncertain. Some examples of such stocks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Further in this article, we will discuss high-yield stocks to buy in February.Story continuesDividend Capture Strategy: 10 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in FebruaryPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from PexelsOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in February and March.

And Jenny, I will hand it over to you.Story continuesJennifer Parmentier: Thank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. As Todd said, before we get into the quarter results, I'd like to remind everyone what drives Parker and give you some insight on where we'll be focusing. Moving to Slide 2. New CEO, same three drivers: living up to our purpose, continuing to be great generators and deployers of cash and achieving top-quartile performance versus our proxy peers. Slide 3, please. Safety, purpose and engagement are the foundation of top quartile performance. As I mentioned to all of you in the December call, we are committed to delivering the Meggitt cost synergies of $300 million, and we're very pleased with the progress to date. We've said before, it's still early innings for Win Strategy 3.0, and we will continue to utilize it to accelerate our performance.Our culture is one of continuous improvement as evidenced by past performance and results we will deliver well into the future. And we are fully committed to achieving our FY '27 targets that we rolled out at Investor Day last March. All of this will allow us to continue with the transformation and ensure a very promising future for Parker. Moving to Slide 4, please. You've seen this before, Parker has a proven strategy. The Win Strategy is and will remain our business system. It is a system focused on the fundamentals. We trust the process, and we'll continue to get results from it as we have in the past. Slide 5, please. So where will Win Strategy 3.0 accelerate our performance? Well, it always starts with our people. Safety number 1 and it always will be.Our goal is zero incidents, and we believe it is possible. We brought a lot of new people into the business over the last couple of years, and we have the opportunity to double down on the training and chartering of high-performance teams and leaders. This will further strengthen our culture of continuous improvement and our brand of Kaizen well into the future. Moving over to customer experience. We have an opportunity to do even better with the digital customer experience. Anywhere from how we interact with our customers on quotes and orders, to the availability of digital products and the use of artificial intelligence for demand forecasting with both our customers and our suppliers. It's early days for our zero defect initiative as well.This obviously drives better quality and overall customer satisfaction. This is the exact same approach that we took with zero safety incidents. Zero defects is possible. It starts with engaging our people around robust products and capable processes. Doing this right exposes the hidden factory, improves quality, reduces cost and thus expand margin. Best-in-class lead times have been part of our Win Strategy for many years. And coming out of the pandemic and subsequent increase in volume, we see even more opportunities to improve lead times and become supply chain leaders. Our customers deserve this level of service and all of these are strong enablers of growth. Profitable growth is a combination of performance and portfolio changes, which we have demonstrated.Strategic positioning is a tool used by our general managers to segment their business and position them best in their markets and with their customers. This process and cadence will continue to drive the critical thinking about growth in the division and closest to the customer. We are obviously seeing the benefits of the transformed portfolio, and we will continue to seek out those opportunities that will enhance the transformation. The most significant CapEx spending in decades will bring growth to Parker with all the technologies we have supporting the secular trends today and for many years to come. And we have an annual cash incentive plan, which incentivizes the right behaviors and drives a real intensity around growth. Moving over to financial performance.We have a proven set of simplification tools, which will continue to help us reduce complexity and cost. House in this area is our simple by design process, which you've heard us talk about a lot. This has become a fundamental -- a business fundamental across the Corporation. We have a robust process around value pricing, and we'll continue to strive for margin neutrality in these inflationary times. We will also double down on training the principles of lean. This is the foundation of our continuous improvement culture and it drives safety and productivity in all of our operations. You've heard us say many times over the past few years that while not immune to the chaos of the supply chain, we fared better than others due to our dual sourcing initiatives and our local-for-local strategy.The pandemic and subsequent increase in volume exposed some areas that we can further improve upon to ensure that we become supply chain leaders. Our teams are looking to further enhance the visibility of the changing demand picture and utilize some new scheduling tools that will drive efficiency in the operations and those best-in-class lead times that I just mentioned. Focusing on these areas and Win Strategy 3.0 will help us to achieve top quartile performance. Slide 6, please. Our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged. We will maintain our record on dividend payouts and target a 5-year average payout of 30% to 35% net income. We will target 2% of sales on CapEx to fund organic growth and productivity. The 10b5-1 share repurchase program will remain in place and our near-term and top priority is to delever post the Meggitt acquisition.We will keep our acquisition pipeline healthy and we'll continue to build relationships for future acquisitions. Slide 7, please. So Q2 was another quarter of excellent operating performance. We saw a 16% reduction in safety incidents versus prior year, further supporting our ability to reach zero incidents. Sales came in at $4.7 billion, a 22% increase to prior with organic growth coming in at 10%. Strong segment operating margin across all segments has led us to a full year guidance increase and we are very happy with the progress of the Meggitt integration. All activities and synergies are on schedule. Moving to Slide 8. We'd like to share some recent highlights on the integration. Key leaders from both Parker and Meggitt are leading over 20 teams that are creating a lot of value in integrating the functions.Engagement with the team members and the customers that had widespread activity in all locations and wind strategy training and implementation is well underway. Just to note here, we have a proven track record of delivering synergy targets, and this acquisition will be the same. The teams are following the integration playbook that has been developed over the last several acquisitions, and I am sure they will add some new best practices to it as well. Slide #9. So we are on track to achieve the $60 million in synergies by the end of this fiscal year, and the graph on the left illustrates our path to $300 million in synergies and adjusted EBITDA margins of 30% by FY '26. Synergies are represented in blue and the cumulative costs to achieve are in gold.On the right side of this page, this quadrant depicts the use of the overall Win Strategy to achieve the synergies and ensure operational excellence into the future. Starting with the top left, Safety, Lean, Kaizen, high-performance teams all make up our brand of Kaizen and will drive the engagement and continuous improvement well into the future. Simplification is a major area of focus for the integration teams. This is where we look at structure and org design. We use our 80-20 complexity reduction tool, and we implement simple by design principles. All of this drives real ownership and decision-making at the division level, further empowering the team to drive results. Moving over to SG&amp;A. We've had the realization that there's a lot of opportunity moving Meggitt from a centralized structure to Parker's decentralized structure, driving that overall decision-making to the local level and improving overall speed.With this acquisition, footprint optimization is very minor. Remember, we have complementary technologies with this acquisition and not a lot of overlap at the plant level. And with supply chain will optimize pricing, terms and conditions, direct and indirect material spend as well as logistics. Again, off to a great start, very pleased with the performance on quarter end. And now I'll turn it back to Todd for a summary of our Q2 results.Technology, Movement, ControlPhoto by Ibrahim Boran on UnsplashTodd Leombruno: Thanks, Jenny. That was great. Okay. So I'm going to begin on Slide 12 with the financial results. I can't tell you how excited the team is. This is the first full quarter that includes Meggitt in our results. It also is the first full quarter that we do not have Aircraft Wheel and Brake in our results. So the year-over-year comparisons are a little bit more complicated than usual. But you see the top line sales increased 22% versus prior year. That clearly is a record for us at $4.7 billion. Organic growth continues to be extremely healthy and was just over 10% in the quarter. That does extend our string of double-digit organic growth quarters. Although better than forecasted, the currency headwinds do continue.The currency impact to sales was unfavorable by 4% in the quarter versus prior year. And when you look at the net of the Meggitt acquisition and the Aircraft Wheel and Brake divestiture, that was a positive 16% to our sales in the quarter. Looking at adjusted segment operating margin, we exceeded our forecast, and we finished at 21.5%. And if you look at adjusted EBITDA margins, that was even stronger at 22.4%. And just as a reminder, we mentioned this last quarter, we do expect Meggitt to be just slightly dilutive to overall margins in this first sub-years as we generate those synergies that Jenny just spoke to. Looking at adjusted net income, we did $619 million or 13.2% ROS. That is an improvement of 6% versus prior year, and adjusted earnings per share were $4.76.That's a Q2 record and an increase of $0.30 or 7% compared to the prior year. Overall for Q3, we are extremely happy to have that first quarter of Meggitt in the books to see that sales increase by 22% and obviously, see the positive net income and EPS growth. So just really happy with the results of the quarter. If we jump to Slide 13. This is just going to be the visual elements of that $0.30 EPS improvement. And again, I'm really happy to say the driver of this is the additional segment operating income. We generated $180 million or 22% additional segment operating income versus the prior year. If you look at that, that added $1.8 to EPS for the quarter. Interest expense, as expected, is a headwind. It's a $0.51 headwind. That was a little bit higher than we were expecting just with the movement in rates, 100% of that entire $0.51 is related to the Meggitt transaction and what's going on in the rate environment.Other expense was $0.12 unfavorable. That was primarily driven by year-over-year changes in currency rates and income tax is a drag of $0.14, really because last year benefited from a number of discrete items that were favorable. And of course, this year, we have some of these transaction costs in the quarter that are not deductible. Everything else nets to just $0.01. And if you look at all those items, that makes up our $0.30 increase to that record $4.76 earnings per share, and we're really happy with that. If you jump to Slide 14 and just looking at the segments, once again, every segment was positive organic growth in the quarter. We exceeded our margins across the board. Every segment exceeded our expectations on margins. Orders remain positive despite some pretty tough comps in the prior year and for the total company finished at plus 3.And really, demand does remain robust across all the markets we serve. Our team members really are working hard to meet customer expectations. And the result is that record sales that we just generated in the second quarter. If you look specifically at the North American businesses, Sales are extremely strong at $2.1 billion. Organic growth in that segment is 13.5%. Adjusted operating margins did increase 50 basis points in North America. They finished at 21.8%, that is a record and just really healthy volumes and a gradually improving supply chain really helped drive performance in those North American businesses. Order rates are positive at plus 2 and that really matches our strong backlog and really that broad-based demand that is consistent across North America.So special thanks to our team members in North America for their record performance. Looking at the international businesses, sales were $1.4 billion. Organic growth there, almost 9% from prior year. And across all of our regions in the International segment, we were positive from an organic growth standpoint. Margins remained high at 21.9%. This is slightly down from prior year, really due to currency, a little bit of product mix and some China COVID-related headwinds, just specifically in China. Order rates are minus 4. They were positive last quarter, but that did have a bit of a rebound, if you remember, from the COVID-related shutdowns in China. So we're watching that very closely. Aerospace Systems, obviously, huge sales, up 84%. They did exceed $1 billion for the first time, and that obviously is clearly driven by the addition of the Meggitt businesses in our Aerospace Systems segment.Organic growth in aerospace was almost 5%. Really strong OEM and MRO commercial activity in that segment, both from sales and orders being mid-teen positive on the OEM side of it and military OEM remains negative as we expected. Operating margins were 20.6% in that segment. That is up 70 basis points from last quarter and better than we forecasted. And really, the Meggitt integration, the performance of the businesses, the synergies, like Jenny had mentioned, totally on track, and we're really happy with that. When you look at aerospace orders, they are plus 22. We talked for the last couple of quarters about that bad comp we had with the military orders we've now -- we've passed that comp. So you can see the orders are 22%. We're really happy with that.Great performance across all of the businesses this quarter. Great job, everyone. If we go to Slide 15, this is just cash flow. This is our performance on a year-to-date basis. The Meggitt transaction, we've talked about this last quarter, there's a drag to cash flow just based on some of those transactions costs. They did impact CFOA and free cash flow by roughly 2%. But even excluding that, if you look at the numbers as reported, cash flow from operations is 12.1% of sales. We did surpass $1 billion in cash flow from operations on a year-to-date basis and our free cash flow is 10% of sales. Our CapEx, as we have communicated, just slightly over 2% for the year, and free cash flow conversion is 114%. I think everyone knows us pretty well. Our cash flow is always second half weighted and we continue to forecast mid-teens cash flow from operations, and certainly, free cash flow conversion over 100% for the full year.If we jump to Slide 16, just a few comments on capital deployment. I think everyone saw that last week, our Board approved a quarterly dividend payout of $1.33 per share. That is our 291st consecutive quarterly dividend, and it is certainly in line with those targets that Jenny mentioned earlier. On leverage, we did make progress on reducing our leverage. If you look at gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, that was 3.6. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.4. Both of those metrics improved 0.2 turns from Q1. So that EBITDA is on a trailing 12-month basis. And just a reminder, that only includes Meggitt EBITDA from the date of close, so roughly 3.5 months of Meggitt EBITDA. And I'm proud to say we've now applied over $2.2 billion of cash towards that Meggitt transaction.And we're really fully committed to our deleveraging plan, and that plan remains on track. So good progress there. Okay. So moving to guidance on Slide 17. You saw we did increase our guidance this morning. We are providing this as usual, on an as reported and on an adjusted basis. And if you look at the sales range, we are increasing that. We're increasing the range from 14.5 to 16.5 or from, excuse me, 14.5 to 16.5 or 15.5% at the midpoint. More importantly, organic growth, if you look at our organic growth for the full year, we are increasing that to 7%. That is up 1% from 6% last quarter. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We're moving that up just slightly to 11.5%. That was 11% last quarter. And while currency is still a headwind, we expect that to be less bad.We now forecast that to be a 3% impact to sales, negative. And that's down from what we were forecasting last quarter at negative 4.5 and that is using spot rates as of December 31 like we normally do. When you look at adjusted segment operating margins for the full year, we are increasing that full year guide by 20 basis points to 22.1%, and that is at the midpoint, there's a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. And just a few additional items to note. If you look at interest expense, that is now up to $555 million. That was $510 million last quarter. That does include the changes in the interest rates that just were announced yesterday and really what we forecast them to do in the upcoming months. Corporate G&amp;A is $204 million and other income is really an income of $18 million.Both of those numbers are virtually unchanged from our prior guide. If you look at our tax rate, just based on where we're at now, halfway through the year, we believe that will be 23.5% for the full year. And adjusted EPS is now raised to $19.45, that's a $0.50 increase from our prior guide and there is a range around that or plus or minus $0.25. Specifically, for Q3, organic growth is expected to be nearly 4%. We raised that from our prior guide and adjusted EPS is expected to be at the midpoint. And finally, adjustments in the forecast at a pre-tax level are listed here on this table for the remainder of the year, together with acquisition-related expenses incurred to date. So that's the details on guidance. If you go to Slide 18, this is again just a little bridge on that.You can see where we start. Our prior guide was $18.95, that strong performance in Q2. We're rolling in that $0.45 beat. We are increasing segment operating income by $0.35 for the remainder of the second half. And I just wanted to note that $0.25 of that is due to the less bad currency rates. If you remember last quarter, we knocked that down a little bit based on where rates were at the end of September. We've now moved that back a little bit, and there's a little bit more based on the organic growth increases, and that is $0.35. Interest and tax still continue to be a bit of a headwind. You can see the interest expense is a $0.20 headwind and income tax for the second half of the year is just $0.10. Add it all together, we get to $19.45 at the midpoint, and that is the changes to our guidance.So with that slide, I will ask you to focus on Slide 19. And Jenny, I will hand it back over to you for summary comments before we go to Q&amp;A.Jennifer Parmentier: Thank you, Todd. So we have a very promising future. We have a highly engaged team that's living up to its purpose. We'll continue to accelerate our performance with Win Strategy 3.0. We are seeing the benefit of our strategic portfolio transformation, and we will continue to be great generators and deployers of cash. And with that, Chris, I think we're ready for questions. See also 10 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks To Buy  and 15 Biggest Neuroscience Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $352.74 in the previous session. Parker-Hannifin has gained 19.9% since the start of the year compared to the 7% move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 10.4% return for the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 2, 2023, Parker-Hannifin reported EPS of $4.76 versus consensus estimate of $4.45 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.78%.For the current fiscal year, Parker-Hannifin is expected to post earnings of $19.41 per share on $18.35 billion in revenues. This represents a 3.69% change in EPS on a 15.68% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $20.85 per share on $19.1 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 7.43% and 4.1%, respectively.Valuation MetricsParker-Hannifin may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Parker-Hannifin has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 22.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.9X versus its peer group's average of 13.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.53. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Parker-Hannifin currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Parker-Hannifin passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Parker-Hannifin shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

76,f094c71c-32d1-36ce-86a8-f030a8b09514,ADM,2023-02-08,A Look At The Fair Value Of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-archer-daniels-130039904.html,1675861239,STORY,['ADM'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.97bUS$3.05bUS$2.83bUS$2.17bUS$2.12bUS$2.11bUS$2.11bUS$2.12bUS$2.14bUS$2.17bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.85%Est @ 0.03%Est @ 0.64%Est @ 1.07%Est @ 1.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.3kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$24bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$41b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$82.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Archer-Daniels-MidlandStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Engineers use software such as Synopsys's to figure out where to put them, running several rounds of experiments with several possible designs to find the best one.The problem in recent years is that chips have become far, far more complex, which means that finding the right design takes more and more experiments. But business deadlines have not gotten any longer: customers still want a steady drumbeat of new chips year after year.To meet those deadlines, the AI system's job is to help engineers weed out all the design experiments that will not lead to success and point to those that will.""We have a limited amount of time,"" said Indavong Vongsavady, who oversees design tools for one of STMicro's groups. ""Limiting to a practical number the size of experiments that we run - that's the real point.""Cloud computing also helps ease the time crunch. Shankar Krishnamoorthy, general manager of the design automation group at Synopsys, said that company's AI engine got better results faster when it had more computing power behind it. Cloud providers like Microsoft offer the option to rent a huge burst of computing power in a short time.""In most engineering environments, people say, 'This is how much compute (power) I have. This is the time in which I need the results. Give me the best result,'"" Krishnamoorthy said.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Bradley Perrett)]"

He has apologized and taken responsibility for the troubles, but the company has sent mixed messages, saying its technology worked just fine and it was the weather's fault despite no other airline suffering such a breakdown in service.Southwest's struggles reached a notable low on Jan. 28 when comedy sketch TV show ""Saturday Night Live"" lampooned the Dallas-based airline's technology and service.The carrier will now answer to U.S. Congress on Thursday when Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson testifies before the Senate Commerce Committee. The move has caused some industry-watchers to wonder why Jordan failed to accept the invitation despite his plans to attend an employee rally in nearby Baltimore on Wednesday.

He has apologized and taken responsibility for the troubles, but the company has sent mixed messages, saying its technology worked just fine and it was the weather's fault despite no other airline suffering such a breakdown in service.Southwest's struggles reached a notable low on Jan. 28 when comedy sketch TV show ""Saturday Night Live"" lampooned the Dallas-based airline's technology and service.The carrier will now answer to U.S. Congress on Thursday when Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson testifies before the Senate Commerce Committee. The move has caused some industry-watchers to wonder why Jordan failed to accept the invitation despite his plans to attend an employee rally in nearby Baltimore on Wednesday.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Southwest Airlines (LUV).Southwest currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for LUVBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for LUVCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Southwest here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Southwest, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in LUV?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Southwest, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 13.8% over the past month to $2.77.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Southwest. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Southwest with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm’s acquisition of a nicotine pouch company, Swedish Match continues to help grow Philip Morris’ smoke-free segment.The strategic move from Philip Morris has some interesting implications. Expectations for sales growth and margins are suffering in the short-term, but with changing consumer sentiment towards smoking, its likely that Philip Morris is setting itself up for long-term success. Furthermore, it makes the stock more compelling to investors, many of whom have opted out of investing in tobacco companies because of health concerns.But while vapes and other smoke-free options appear to be an improvement in regards to consumers health, the long-term effect of the products are still somewhat unclear. Nonetheless, PM is committed to the plan.Earnings ExpectationsPhilip Morris Q4 sales and earnings are expected to see a decline according to Zack’s estimates. Q4 sales are projected for a YoY decline of -8.2%, bringing sales down to $7.4 billion. Earnings are expected to come in at $1.29 per share, a -4.4% YoY decrease. However, PM still earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), because of its positive earnings revisions trend.Analysts have mixed projections for current quarter earnings, with seven analysts revising higher over the last 60 days, and four revising lower over the same period. But next year’s earnings have analysts in unanimous agreement, with all eleven analysts revising expectations higher over the last 60 days. FY23 EPS has been revised from $5.60 per share to $5.96 over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSmoke-FreePhilip Morris’ business transformation hasn’t happened without some risks and challenges. Since Q4 FY21, margins have compressed by nearly 300 bps. However, PM is betting that this will pay off in the long-term as consumer habits change to prefer smokeless options.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhilip Morris isn’t stopping with vapes either. At the end of 2022, PM became the sole owner of Swedish Match, the leading nicotine pouch product in the world. I know personally, I have seen an explosion in the use of their product Zyn. The acquisition cost PM $16 billion, and makes for a significant new additions to their product line.An added benefit of PM’s acquisition of Swedish Match, is that it brings them back into the US market for the first time in 14 years. This move should keep PM’s US competitor Altria MO on its toes.Philip Morris has big plans as a smokeless company and states, “By 2025, our target is to increase that figure to at least 50 percent, with the ultimate goal of phasing out cigarettes completely. We also aim for USD 1 billion in annual net revenues to come from wellness and healthcare products.”ValuationPhilip Morris currently trades at a one year forward P/E of 16.9x, a premium to the industry average, and just above it’s 5-year median of 15.2x. With the ongoing transition the company is going through it is quite impressive that it can maintain a premium valuation. That may signal investors giving PM a vote of confidence.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPM is not a high-flying growth stock, but it is definitely a steady earner. The stock also has a very appealing 5% dividend yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionIf you are an investor willing to stomach an allocation to a tobacco company, Philip Morris may well be a great addition to your portfolio. PM is actively shifting its business to be well positioned for the future, has a long history of success and offers the stability of a generous dividend yield. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted revenue by approximately three percentage points.GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.65 compared to $0.42 in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was primarily due to a non-cash charge related to the termination of the Company’s pension plan in the prior year period, while the current year period was impacted by the gain on sale of the United Kingdom Business Solutions business, a lower GAAP effective tax rate due to the reversal of significant uncertain tax positions, and lower share count, partially offset by lower operating profit.Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.32 compared to $0.64 in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS was driven by lower operating profit, a negative impact from currency, and a higher adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower share count. In the prior year period, Business Solutions contributed approximately $0.08 to EPS, while operations in Russia and Belarus contributed approximately $0.06 to EPS.""Fourth quarter and full year 2022 results were in-line with our expectations and our adjusted full year 2022 financial outlook. In October, we launched our ‘Evolve 2025’ strategy to be the leading provider of branded accessible financial services to the aspiring populations of the world. Developing and delivering products that drive financial inclusion and enable our customers to move up the ladder of financial well-being is central to our strategy,"" said Devin McGranahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western Union.Story continuesMcGranahan added, ""While we are still early in our journey, we are making progress against the goals we shared at our 2022 Investor Day. In the fourth quarter we saw a return to transaction growth in our branded digital business, completed the launch of our digital bank in Italy, and in 2022 opened over 60 owned and concept stores. Each of these marks progress against the four pillars of our strategy.""The Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.235 per common share, payable March 31, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2023._________________________For a full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics, please see the ""Non-GAAP Measures"" section of this press release.Q4 Business ResultsC2C revenues declined 11% on a reported basis, or 9% constant currency, while transactions declined 12% compared to the prior year period. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted C2C revenue and transactions by three percentage points and nine percentage points, respectively. Regionally, transaction declines in Europe and CIS, North America, MEASA, and APAC were partially offset by transaction growth in LACA.Branded Digital revenue declined 8% on a reported basis, or 6% constant currency. Transactions grew 2% in the quarter driven by the Company’s revised marketing strategy. The Company expects that revenue will be adversely impacted in the near term related to its revised marketing strategy, which includes promotional pricing activities. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted both Branded Digital revenue and transactions by 2 percentage points in the quarter.Q4 Financial ResultsGAAP operating margin in the quarter was 13.9%, compared to 24.7% in the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin was 15.8% compared to 24.9% in the prior year period, with the prior year positively impacted by 60 basis points from the inclusion of Business Solutions. The decrease in the adjusted operating margin was primarily due to lower revenue and higher investments in technology and marketing.The GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was (15.2%), compared to 6.7% in the prior year period with the decrease primarily due to the reversal of significant uncertain tax positions, partially offset by discrete benefits in the prior year period. The adjusted effective tax rate was 14.7% in the quarter, compared to 12.1% in the prior year period, primarily due to discrete benefits in the prior year period.The Company returned $263 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, consisting of $88 million in dividends and $175 million of share repurchases.2022 Full Year Financial ResultsThe Company’s full year 2022 revenue of $4.5 billion declined 12% on a reported basis, or 4% on a constant currency basis excluding the contribution from Business Solutions, compared to the prior year. The suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus negatively impacted revenue by approximately two percentage points, while Argentina inflation benefited revenue by approximately one percentage point.GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, compared to 22.1% in the prior year. The adjusted operating margin was 20.4% compared to 22.5% in the prior year, with the prior year positively impacted by 20 basis points from the inclusion of Business Solutions. The decrease in the adjusted operating margin was primarily due to lower revenue and investments in the Company’s ""Evolve 2025"" strategy, including technology and marketing.The GAAP effective tax rate for 2022 was 9.7% compared to 13.9% in the prior year with the decrease due to the reversal of significant uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the sale of the Company's Business Solutions business. The adjusted effective tax rate was 15.0% compared to 12.7% in 2021. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of higher taxed earnings, the effects of changes in U.S. tax rules, and discrete benefits in the prior year.GAAP EPS was $2.34, compared to $1.97 in 2021, while adjusted EPS was $1.76, compared to $2.19 in 2021. The increase in GAAP earnings per share was primarily due to the partial gain on sale of the Business Solutions business, a non-cash charge related to the termination of the Company’s pension plan in the prior year, lower share count, and a lower GAAP effective tax rate, partially offset by lower operating profit. The decline in adjusted EPS was due to lower operating profit and a higher adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower share count. In 2021, Business Solutions and operations in Russia and Belarus contributed $0.44 to EPS and in 2022, Business Solutions and operations in Russia and Belarus contributed $0.09 to EPS.GAAP cash flow from operating activities for the year was $582 million. The Company returned approximately $713 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases for the full year.During 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Business Solutions business to Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC. The sale is expected to be completed in three closings, the first of which occurred on March 1, 2022, with the entirety of the cash consideration collected at that time. The first closing excluded the operations in the European Union and the United Kingdom and resulted in a gain of $151 million. The second closing, which included the United Kingdom operations, occurred on December 31, 2022, and resulted in a gain of $97 million. The third closing, which includes the European Union operations, is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of 2023, pending regulatory approvals, at which time an estimated pre-tax gain of approximately $22 million will be recognized, subject to regulatory capital adjustments.2023 OutlookToday, the Company reaffirmed its 2023 adjusted full year financial outlook provided on October 20, 2022. The outlook assumes no material changes in macroeconomic conditions, including changes in foreign currencies.The 2023 outlook is as follows:GAAPAdjustedRevenue1(9%) to (7%)(4%) to (2%)Operating Margin18% to 20%19% to 21%EPS$1.48 to $1.58$1.55 to $1.651 Adjusted revenue is constant currency and proforma for the planned sale of Business SolutionsNon-GAAP MeasuresWestern Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.Reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures are available in the accompanying schedules and in the ""Investor Relations"" section of the Company’s website at https://ir.westernunion.com.GAAP figures (2023 and 2022 only) reflect an expected partial year of Business Solutions ownership, including contractual payments to the buyers, representing profits between the first and third closings. Adjusted constant currency revenue growth metrics exclude contributions from Business Solutions.

This compares to earnings of $3 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.26%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this aircraft components maker would post earnings of $4.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.50, delivering a surprise of 11.34%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.TransDigm , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.4 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.40%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.TransDigm shares have added about 14.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.1%.What's Next for TransDigm?While TransDigm has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for TransDigm: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

Simon signed 4,100 leases for more than 12 million square feet and retailer reported sales per square foot was $753 in 2022, up 6% year-over-year.More from Footwear NewsThree Signs That 2023 Could Be a Busy Year for M&amp;A After AllHow Malls Will Change in 2023, From New Tenants to Reimagined Department StoresKimora Lee Simmons Delivers Winter Glamour in Snow Boots for Baby Phat x Forever 21 Campaign With Daughters Aoki &amp; Ming Lee“Right now, we feel really good about our retailers,” said president and CEO of Simon Property Group David Simon in a Monday call with analysts. “I think they were very focused on entering 2023 with good, clean inventories. We feel like most of them have managed that.”Simon noted that the company has more lease agreements in the pipeline for 2023 and 2024.Simon has a history on being vocally bullish on brick-and-mortar retail and has maintained that retailers need to invest more heavily in physical stores to be able to grow as e-commerce sales slow down. Many retailers have recently announce investments into physical locations. In the last few quarters, Forever 21, Ross Stores, Ralph Lauren and more companies have announced expanding their store fleets. Some, such as Clarks, are specifically leaning into mall-based locations.According to data from foot traffic analyzer Placer.ai, U.S. mall visits increased in January 2023 across indoor malls, open-air lifestyle centers and outlet malls over January of 2022. However, January 2023 visits were down compared to January 2020.Alongside its occupancy growth, Simon did note a demand slowdown for its owned retail stores, such as Forever 21, which is partly owned by Simon in a joint venture with Authentic Brands Group called SPARC, and JCPenney, which is owned by Simon and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM).Story continuesLike other major retailers in recent quarters, both of these apparel-based chains were “affected by inflationary pressures and consumers reducing their spend,” Simon said. Many retailers entered the holiday season with higher-than-usual inventories, due to rapidly shifting trends and inflation-stricken consumers. Throughout Q4, retailers implemented markdowns to clear through excesses to set them up for growth in 2023.For Simon’s retail business, this demand slowdown was most evident at Forever 21.“That teenage consumer obviously cut back with the rapid increase in gas prices and inflation and the uncertain economic environment,” Simon said, adding that other tenants are reporting stronger demand due to the bounce-back from Covid-19.Despite recent positive trends in China, Simon does not expect major tailwinds as it relate to more Chinese consumers shopping in coastal premium outlets and malls, though a lift to sales would be welcomed.“We think there’s a real benefit to our landmark assets that have always been shopped by the Chinese consumer or the Asian consumer,” Simon said. “We’re starting to see that a little bit, but we’re not planning for that to really accelerate in 2023 — but we’re hopeful that it will.”]"

GPN is set to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 10, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading payment technology company’s adjusted earnings of $2.48 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4% due to elevated operating costs resulting from higher selling, general and administrative expenses. However, the downside was partly offset by sound contributions from its Merchant and Issuer businesses.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $2.45 suggests a 15% increase from the prior-year figure of $2.13. It witnessed no movement in the past week. Global Payments beat the consensus estimate for earnings in two of the prior four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, with the average surprise being 0.5%. This is depicted in the graph below:Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. price-eps-surprise | Global Payments Inc. QuoteThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $2 billion indicates a 2.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter, profits from GPN’s Merchant Solutions — its biggest operating segment — are likely to have increased from higher customer spending. Higher travel and entertainment-related spendings are expected to have benefited the company’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues from Merchant Solutions is pegged at $1,603 million, indicating an 8.7% increase from the year-ago period. The strong software businesses and continued execution of a technology-enabled strategy are likely to have driven the segment’s performance.The consensus mark for Issuer Solutions’ adjusted revenues is pegged at $507 million, signaling 9.5% year-over-year growth from fourth-quarter 2021 while our estimate suggests a 15.6% increase. The addition of the leading accounts payable automation as well as business-to-business payments solutions provider MineralTree is likely to have aided the segment’s performance. These are expected to have positioned GPN for year-over-year growth.Story continuesHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Consumer Solutions segment indicates a 22.5% year-over-year decrease while our estimate predicts a 14.5% decline. Higher levels of unemployment assistance benefits might have affected the segment.Profits from the business are likely to have been partially offset by increased operating costs in the fourth quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain. Higher cost of service and selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have affected the bottom line. We expect total operating expenses to have jumped 4.3% year over year. Continuous investments to upgrade digital capabilities are expected to have weighed on the margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Global Payments this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -2.12%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.40 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.45.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Global Payments currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Global Payments, here are some companies from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:GFL Environmental Inc.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), which is up 54%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 21% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 39% , including dividends .While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Schlumberger moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Schlumberger has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Schlumberger the TSR over the last 3 years was 63%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Schlumberger shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 39% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 0.9% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Schlumberger .If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Both the earnings and net sales missed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and decreased on a year-over-year basis. Shares of the company fell 4.06% in the after-hours trading session on Feb 6.The downtrend was caused by weak demand in residential end markets and dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment pressure. The company anticipates 2023 to be a challenging year due to these headwinds.President and CEO of Leggett, Mitch Dolloff, said, ""We are focused on improving the things that we can control and continuing to mitigate the impacts of market challenges on our business. We are working with our customers on new product opportunities, continuing our focus on improving operating efficiency, and driving strong cash management. Our financial strength gives us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate challenging markets while investing in long-term opportunities.”Quarter in DetailsLeggett reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share, which lagged the consensus estimate of 48 cents by 18.8% and decreased 49% from 77 cents reported a year ago.

Organically, sales were down 12% year over year. Raw material-related selling prices added 2%, and acquisitions, net of small divestitures, contributed 2% to sales growth.Volumes declined by 12% due to continued demand softness in residential end markets, partially offset by growth in the Automotive, Aerospace, and Hydraulic Cylinders businesses. The currency also impacted sales by 2%.Adjusted EBIT declined 40.1% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $91.2 million. The downside was due to lower volume and reduced overhead absorption as LEG intentionally cut production in the Steel Rod business to reduce inventory levels.Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 380 basis points (bps) to 7.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Adjusted EBITDA margin also declined 350 bps to 11.4%.Story continuesSegment DetailsNet trade sales in Bedding Products (excluding intersegment sales) decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $522.4 million. A volume decline of 19% was caused by softness in the United States and European demand as well as lower demand in the Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses. Increased prices contributed 1% amid a 1% decline from currency fluctuation. Organically, sales were down 19% year over year.Adjusted EBIT margin fell 590 bps to 5.8%. Adjusted EBITDA margin also fell 510 bps year over year to 10.8%.The Specialized Products segment's trade sales rose 15% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $302.8 million. Volume increased by 10% across the segment. A favorable selling price increased sales by 4%, and the Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition contributed 10%. Currency impact lowered sales by 9%. Organically, sales were up 5% year over year.EBIT margin contracted by 300 bps to 8.7%. EBITDA margin plunged 330 bps year over year to 12.1%.Trade sales in the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment rose 3% from the prior-year quarter’s level to $370.6 million. Volume was down 6%, mainly due to declines in Home Furniture, Fabric Converting and Flooring, partially offset by growth in Work Furniture. Raw material-related selling price added 10% to sales, but currency declined sales by 1%. Organically, sales were down 13% year over year.EBIT margin of 8.8% was down 200 bps from the prior year. EBITDA margin also contracted 180 bps to 10.4%.2022 HighlightsNet revenues for the year totaled $5.15 billion, up 1% from $5.07 billion and flat organically year over year. Adjusted earnings came in at $2.27 per share compared with $2.78 in the previous year.Adjusted EBIT fell 14.6% from the prior year to $485 million, owing to lower volume and overhead absorption from reduced production, operational inefficiencies in Specialty Foam and Automotive, and higher raw material and transportation costs. Adjusted EBIT margin also contracted 180 bps from the year-ago figure to 9.4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 200 bps to 12.9%.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $1 billion in liquidity. It had $316.5 million of cash and equivalents at 2022-end compared with $361.7 million at 2021-end. Long-term debt at the 2022-end was $2.07 billion, up 16% from $1.79 from the 2021-end. The trailing 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.66x in 2022 versus 2.29x in 2021.Cash from operations for 2022 totaled $441.4 million versus $271.3 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $100 million in 2022.In 2022, dividends were $1.74 per share compared with $1.66 per share in 2021. In November 2022, the company raised its dividend by two cents to 44 cents. In 2022, Leggett repurchased 1.7 million shares at an average price of $35.94 and issued 0.9 million shares through employee benefit plans. At the end of 2022, it had 132.6 million outstanding under the repurchase program.Q1 GuidanceFor the first quarter of 2023, earnings per share are anticipated to be down significantly from the previous quarter, mainly owing to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals and normal seasonality in some of its businesses.2023 GuidanceLeggett expects sales in the range of $4.8–$5.2 billion. This indicates a 7% decline to 1% growth year over year. The raw material-related price decrease and currency impact are likely to reduce sales by mid-single digits.Sales are likely to be down in the low single digit in Bedding Products, up in the high single digit in Specialized Products and down in the low single digit in the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment. In 2022, acquisitions are expected to add nearly 3% to sales.Earnings are expected to be between $1.50 and $1.90 per share down from the 2022 level due to lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business, lower volume in some businesses and moderate pricing pressure from deflation. The company expects an EBIT margin of 7.5-8%.Capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization costs, and operating cash flow are estimated at $100 million, $200 million and $450–500 million, respectively. Dividend and net interest expenses are likely to be $240 million and $85 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year is projected at 24%.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jessica Kourakos, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please, go ahead.Jessica Kourakos: Thank you, Lynnette. Good morning and thank you for joining Aptiv's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at aptiv.com. Today's review of our financials exclude amortization, restructuring and other special items and we'll address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our Q4 financials as well as our full year 2022 outlook are included at the back of the slide presentation and the earnings press release. During today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, which reflects Aptiv's current view of future financial performance, and may be materially different for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings, including uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's Chairman and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and Joe will cover the financial results in more detail before we open the call to Q&amp;A. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.Kevin Clark: Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on slide three. 2022 was another year with record new business bookings and strong growth over market, driven by our industry-leading portfolio of advanced technologies, as well as our continued flows execution that's kept our customers connected in this challenging environment. Highlights for 2022 included $32 billion of new business bookings, driven by significant active safety, high-voltage and smart vehicle architecture awards. $17.5 billion of revenues, representing 15 points of growth over vehicle production during the quarter, bringing our full year growth over market to 11 points. Operating income and earnings per share for the full year of just under $1.6 billion and $3.41, respectively, reflected the benefit of strong revenue growth and customer recoveries, partially offset by costs related to COVID and ongoing supply chain disruptions, which Joe will cover in greater detail a little later.Story continuesWe also enhanced our portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies with the additions of Wind River and Intercable Automotive, both of which closed during the fourth quarter. I'll expand on these, as well as our enhancements to our operating model on the next slide. As the industry transitions to fully electrified software-defined vehicles, we continue to enhance both our operating model and industry-leading portfolio to further strengthen our capabilities to solve our customers' toughest challenges. As legacy functional and domain-based architectures are increasingly replaced by approaches aligned after smart vehicle architecture, it impacts both the way we design and sell our solutions. This means further strengthening our One Aptiv account-based model, positioning us to engage earlier in the development process and, therefore, more effectively design, specify and deliver optimized solutions across our portfolio, resulting in stronger customer relationships and greater ability to capture value from all our full system solutions.We further enhanced our regional operating model, by increasing local capabilities and empowering those closest to the customer to address their needs quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the continued rollout of our Net Promoter System has resulted in actionable insights to improve our efficiency, our resiliency and service levels, thereby increasing customer intimacy. Lastly, proactive initiatives and risk mitigation actions related to our supply chain have contributed to our ability to keep customers connected through significant disruptions, giving them confidence in our ability to execute on current and future platforms. At the same time, we recognize that the software defined electrified vehicles consumers are demanding will require innovative new solutions and we're investing organically and inorganically to position ourselves for that future.Our acquisition of Wind River significantly strengthens our capabilities in software with an industry-first cloud data software platform that speeds development, streamlines deployment and enables full life cycle management for the software-defined vehicle, significantly reducing cost and time to market for our customers while also unlocking new business models. The acquisition of Intercable Automotive enhances our portfolio of high-voltage busbar and interconnect technologies and provides near-term synergies as we expand Intercable's manufacturing capacity in North America and in China. Lastly, we're also investing organically in solutions that further expand our portfolio of industry-leading high-voltage electrification solutions such as integrated power electronics and battery management systems.To help fund these initiatives, we've implemented structural cost reductions that will save roughly $100 million in annual expense, which will take full effect throughout 2023. These actions further improve the efficiency of our underlying cost structure while allowing us to make investments that better position Aptiv for long-term outperformance. As shown on Slide 5, nowhere is the strength of our track record and portfolio more evident than in our new business bookings performance. 2022 bookings reached a record $32 billion, an increase of over 3% from last year's record of $24 billion. advanced safety and user experience bookings totaled a record $12 billion, driven by $4.2 billion of customer awards for our smart vehicle architecture solutions across three different OEMs, including central vehicle controller and Power Data Center Bookings with the Volkswagen Group, bringing cumulative customer awards for SBA products since our launch to over $5 billion with five different OEMs. Active safety bookings of $5.2 billion, representing a combination of next-gen hardware and perception software building blocks as well as full system turnkey awards, including an award from a large European-based global OEM as well as the Chinese OEM BYD, which represents the seventh customer to select Aptiv scalable platform to efficiently support a wide range of advanced safety features.The strength of our portfolio of active safety solutions is reflected in the $20 billion of cumulative bookings since 2018. Signal Power Solutions new business bookings reached a record $20 billion for the year, the result of strong growth in low voltage vehicle architecture, including a $2 billion like commercial vehicle booking with a major North American OEM in the fourth quarter and continued strong bookings in adjacent markets. A record $4.2 billion of high-voltage electrification bookings, up from roughly $2 billion just a few years ago, including awards from several North American, European and China-based OEMs, representing both traditional and new mobility providers across our electrical architecture and engineered components product lines, bringing cumulative high-voltage customer awards to $14 billion since 2018.Our industry-leading portfolio, combined with our unparalleled ability to execute highly complex programs, even in today's challenging environment positions us to continue to win new business, resulting in clear line of sight to roughly $32 billion of business awards during 2023. Moving to Slide 6 to review the segment highlights. Beginning with the Advanced Safety &amp; User Experience segment. This past year, we became the first technology provider to successfully launch a full stack hands-free Level 2+ ADAS system with a European-based global OEM. This is a great example of our full system capabilities applied to active safety as well as our flexible business model and open platform approach, which allows OEMs to leverage their own innovations, as well as those from Aptiv and other third parties to deliver a unique, high-performing driving experience.We're also deeply engaged with several customers regarding Wind River's cloud-native software platform, which we're confident will lead to commercial awards over the course of 2023. Turning to Signal &amp; Power Solutions segment. We continue to be perfectly positioned with an industry-leading portfolio of electrification solutions that span multi-voltage distribution, connection and cable management. Reflecting the accelerating demand for battery electric vehicles, the $4.2 billion of high-voltage new business bookings I referenced on the prior slide, accounted for over 20% of the segment's total bookings, and high-voltage revenues increased 33% over the prior year, 28 points over vehicle production. In addition, our new offerings in power electronics and battery management systems are gaining traction as demonstrated by a significant integrated power electronics and BMS award from a North American-based global OEM, where a solution will be used across all their bet platforms beginning in 2025.And the pipeline of customers evaluating the deployment of a similar solution is growing. Our customers recognize our track record of flawless execution, which is a driver behind the customer service, quality and supply chain awards we received. The cost recoveries we negotiated and the record level of new business bookings we've been awarded. Our full system edge-to-cloud vehicle architecture solutions have enabled us to pursue high-growth margin accretive opportunities that position us to continue to deliver outsized revenue growth and margin expansion for years to come. Moving to Slide 7. At this year's CES event in Las Vegas, we brought the software-defined vehicle to life, showcasing Aptiv's unique full stack capabilities. We debut Wind River software platform, fully integrated with a vehicle powered by SBA.Designed vehicle demonstration of the industry's first end-to-end cloud-native DevOps tool chain and vehicle software platform, showed how these solutions improve development speed, quality and efficiency, unlock new business models and enable software functionality to evolve and improve over the life cycle of the vehicle. We also showcased our turnkey Gen 6 ADAS platform, including differentiating KPIs and a public road demonstration. Our radar-centric solution, which is vision agnostic, utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to increase the availability, robustness and efficiency of the perception system, resulting in a solution that can be up to 65% more energy efficient, and 25% more cost effective than equivalent vision-centric solutions.Lastly, we continue to highlight the commercial readiness of our Smart Vehicle Architecture solution. First, by deeply integrating it into a production vehicle, which enabled us to demonstrate a wide range of in-cabin user experience features as well as the fusion of our interior and exterior sensing, resulting in greater safety, comfort and convenience for passengers. And second, through our SVA demonstrator, which enabled guests to see firsthand how these advanced architectures reduce complexity, weight and mass, while also showcasing our latest high-voltage electrification solutions. With over 400 customers, 150 partners and 75 suppliers visiting the Aptiv CES pavilion this year, we reinforced our growing pipeline of commercial opportunities and set the stage for the deeper, more tailored engagements, which I referenced earlier.Automotive, Industry, FactoryPhoto by Daniel @ bestjumpstarterreview.com on UnsplashMoving to slide eight. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I wanted to touch on our outlook for 2023, which Joe will cover in more detail. Building on the foundation from 2022, we expect a very strong year for new business bookings, revenue growth over market and margin expansion. Our robust business model and portfolio of advanced technologies are resulting in sustainable value creation. We continue to widen our competitive moat with investments in advanced technologies and capabilities that drive our operational excellence. This has enabled us to demonstrate strong outperformance even in a weak production environment, as demonstrated by our 2023 outlook, where we continue to expect 8 to 10 points of growth over vehicle production, and 140 basis points of operating margin expansion and strong cash flow growth.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail.Joe Massaro: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Starting with a recap of the fourth quarter on slide nine. As highlighted earlier, the business drove strong growth in the quarter, with revenues of $4.6 billion, up 19% over prior year and representing 15 points of growth above underlying vehicle production. The outgrowth was across both segments, despite continued semiconductor supply chain constraints and COVID disruptions in China that negatively impacted customer production. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $674 million and $523 million, respectively. OI margins expanded 380 basis points versus prior year, reflecting strong flow-through on incremental volumes, the benefit of customer recoveries of direct material cost increases and cost reduction actions taken earlier in 2022.Supply chain disruption costs were favorable by approximately $25 million from the prior year, and foreign exchange was negative in the quarter, reflecting approximately 20 basis points of headwind. EPS in the quarter was $1.27, an increase of 87% from the prior year, driven by overall earnings growth and interest income from higher cash balances maintained prior to the closing of Wind River, partially offset by interest expense and tax expense on higher earnings. The notional EPS impact was a loss of $0.29, an $0.08 increase over last year. Lastly, operating cash flow totaled $933 million and capital expenditures were $178 million for the quarter. Looking at the fourth quarter revenues in more detail on slide 10. Our growth was broad-based across all regions, despite the disruptions in China and continued supply chain constraints.Price downs net cost recoveries and commodities was favorable by approximately $100 million. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue by approximately $300 million in the quarter and late quarter shutdowns in China was a negative $60 million. From a regional perspective, North American revenues were up 21%, or 13% above market, driven by our active safety and high-voltage product lines. In Europe, which continues to be impacted by acute supply chain constraints and macro concerns, adjusted growth was 22%, driven by strength in both segments. And in China, revenues were up 8% or 14 points over market. Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues rose 15% in the quarter or 11 points of growth over underlying vehicle production.Segment adjusted operating income was $77 million, up over 100% year-over-year, reflecting strong flow-through on incremental volumes as well as favorable net price and recoveries, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange in the quarter. Signal and Power revenues rose 20% in the period or 16 points above market. Segment operating income improved by 64%, driven by strong flow-through on incremental volumes, favorable net price recoveries and commodities and lower supply chain disruption costs that partially offset the negative FX impact. Turning now to Slide 12 and our expectations for global vehicle production in 2023. Based on customer schedules, we are forecasting a decrease of 1% for the year reflecting approximately 85 million units of global production.Regionally, we expect North America flat at approximately 15 million units; Europe, down 2% or approximately 16 million units; and China flat at approximately 27 million units. As we discussed during the fourth quarter of last year, we remain cautious about the impact of macroeconomic considerations, particularly in Europe as well as the impact of customer supply chain disruptions, including continued constraints of certain semiconductors. Although the overall supply of semiconductors has improved sequentially, we continue to see acute constraints, particularly in Europe and North America that impact overall customer production levels. Moving to Slide 13, you'll find our 2023 full year outlook, which now includes Wind River and Intercable Automotive.We expect revenue in the range of $18.7 billion to $19.3 billion, up 8% at the midpoint compared to 2022 with 9 points of growth over market. Note that our growth over market excludes the impact of acquisitions. As noted previously, we remain confident in our multiyear growth over market target of 8% to 10%, supported by continued success in our key product lines and high demand for our portfolio of advanced technologies. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion and $2 billion at the midpoint, reflecting strong flow-through on volume growth, continued margin expansion in high-growth product lines and lower COVID supply chain disruption costs. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization is estimated to be $4.25.EPS growth of 25% is driven by strong earnings growth, partially offset by an increase in the expected tax rate of 14.5% and higher net interest expense. The loss related to Motional of $310 million, represents a $0.07 increase over last year. We expect 2023 operating cash flows of $1.9 billion reflecting the higher earnings as well as improved working capital during the year. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 5% of revenues or $950 million for the year. With respect to capital deployment in 2023, we will continue to maintain a well-balanced approach to capital allocation as we continue to prioritize organic investments in the business to support our portfolio of advanced technologies and record new business awards. Execute our M&amp;A strategy and focus on transactions that enhance our scalability across both the brain and nervous system of the vehicle, accelerate our speed to market with relevant technologies and access new markets.And while we will continue to maintain our current financial policy, as it relates to our balance sheet leverage profile to the extent we can take advantage of market disconnects, we will be opportunistic in our share buybacks, returning cash to our shareholders. To that end, our 2023 guidance assumes we offset the impact of stock compensation dilution in 2023 via share repurchase, a practice we had in place prior to 2020. On slide 14, we provide a bridge of 2023 revenue and operating income guidance as compared to 2022. Starting with revenue. Our growth over market, combined with the decrease in global vehicle production, resulted in a net contribution to revenues of over $1 billion. The full year benefit of direct material cost recoveries will effectively offset changes in index commodity and price downs.FX is estimated at a negative $300 million. And lastly, we expect Wind River and Intercable to contribute approximately $700 million for the year. Turning to adjusted operating income. We expect margin expansion of 110 basis points before the benefit of acquisitions, driven by continued strong flow-through on incremental volumes of approximately 30% and the negative impact of price downs, commodities and incremental inflation are partially offset by customer cost recoveries and higher direct labor and other indirect costs are more than offset by increased operating performance, including the benefit of cost saving actions, improved manufacturing performance, as well as a reduction in supply chain disruption costs, which are estimated to be $180 million in 2023.The addition of Wind River and Intercable will increase 2023 operating income to $2 billion, or 10.5%, reflecting margin expansion of 140 basis points and incremental margins of over 27% for the year. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks. Thanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on slide 15 before opening the line up for questions. As the management team reflects on 2022, it's clear that we strengthened our competitive moat and accelerated our commercial momentum, supported by a highly differentiated portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies. Together with our strong track record of operating execution, Aptiv has never been better positioned to provide our customers with full system solutions that advance the industry's vision of the software-defined vehicle.As a reminder, we're hosting our 2023 Investor Day on February 14 in Boston, where we'll provide our view on the industry and how we plan to usher in the next phase of our business strategy. In closing, I'm proud of what the Aptiv team accomplished during 2022 and have never been more excited about what we will deliver in the years ahead. As you'll see in here on February 14, the best is yet to come. Operator, let's now open the line up for questions.See also 20 Stocks That Are Aggressively Buying Back Shares and 11 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study American International Group's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for American International Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:37% = US$15b ÷ US$41b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.37 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 37% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that American International Group has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 59% net income growth seen by American International Group over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared American International Group's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AIG? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is American International Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?American International Group has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 11%, meaning that it has the remaining 89% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, American International Group has been paying dividends over a period of nine years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 22% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 10% over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with American International Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial (HIG) and Old Republic International ORI.Industry: Insurance - MultilineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2050394/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-multiline-insurance-industryProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., The Hartford Financial and Old Republic International. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With seven hikes in interest rate in 2022, already one this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services.Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products as well as exposure to intangible assets offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas.With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte. However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk.The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is currently pegged at $4.69 billion.Our TakeCatalent exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with lower-than-expected earnings. Dismal overall top-line and bottom-line performances, along with a decline in both segments’ reported revenues during the period, are disappointing. The contraction of adjusted operating margin in the quarter also raises apprehension.On a positive note, Catalent’s better-than-expected revenues in the reported quarter and the year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment at CER are impressive. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well. Catalent had undertaken some facility expansion activities during the reported quarter besides inking some strategic deals over the past few months.

SRDX delivered an adjusted loss per share of 50 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which is wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 13 cents per share. However, the figure was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 64 cents per share.Our projection of loss per share was 64 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.GAAP loss per share for the quarter was 56 cents, wider than the year-earlier loss of 20 cents per share.Revenues in DetailSurmodics registered revenues of $24.9 million in the fiscal first quarter, up 8.4% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $24.4 million.The top line was boosted by solid year-over-year product sales growth from the Medical Device business. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in Surmodics’ In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) revenues.Segmental AnalysisSurmodics operates via two reportable segments — Medical Device and IVD.In the reported quarter, sales at the Medical Device segment summed $19 million, up 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. Per management, strong sales of Surmodics’ performance coating reagents and device products, including important contributions from sales of the company’s Pounce and Sublime products, significantly drove the segment. The company also saw higher royalty and license fee revenue.This figure compares to our Medical Device fiscal first-quarter revenue projection of $17.7 million.In the quarter under review, IVD sales declined by 2.9% to $5.9 million, primarily resulting from the completion of a customer development program.This figure compares to our IVD fiscal first-quarter revenue projection of $6.7 million.The company also derives revenues from three primary sources — Product sales, Royalties and license fees, and Research, development and other fees.In the quarter under review, Product sales were $14.2 million, up 15.3% from the prior-year quarter. Royalties and license fees revenues totaled $8.8 million, up 8.2% from the prior-year quarter.

Research and development expenses went up 9.3% year over year to $12.7 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $25.9 million rose 24.6% year over year.Adjusted operating loss totaled $6.3 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million.Financial PositionSurmodics exited first-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $26.4 million compared with $18.9 million at the end of fiscal 2022. The company ended first-quarter fiscal 2023 with total debt of $29.5 million compared with $10 million at the end of fiscal 2022.Net cash used in operating activities at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023 was $10.8 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $7 million a year ago.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceSurmodics has revised its full-year financial outlook.The company now projects fiscal year revenues to be within the range of $102 million-$106 million, representing an increase of 2-6% over the comparable prior-year period. This is lower than the previous outlook of $103 million-$107 million, reflecting an uptick of 3-7% over the comparable prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $105.3 million.Adjusted diluted loss per share for fiscal 2023 is now expected within the range of $2.09-$1.69 compared with the prior outlook of adjusted diluted loss per share of $2.54-$2.14. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at a loss of $2.35 per share.Our TakeSurmodics exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The company registered robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and royalties and license fees. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand. This looks promising for the stock.In October 2022, Surmodics announced its entry into a new, five-year credit agreement with MidCap Financial, which is encouraging. Announcements like the favorable 24-month data from its TRANSCEND clinical trial of the SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB) and positive 12-month data from its SWING first-in-human study of Sundance Sirolimus DCB raise our optimism about the stock.However, the company’s dismal year-over-year bottom-line results in the fiscal first quarter are concerning. Lower revenues from the IVD segment and a decline in research, development and other revenues are discouraging. The gross margin contraction also does not bode well for the stock. Surmodics continued to incur operating losses in the reported quarter, which further raised our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSurmodics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

We have since updated it,"" a Netflix spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.Last week's updates appeared to show the company would require users to identify a ""primary location"" for all accounts that live within the same household. News which had users suggesting this would be a bridge too far, and threatening to leave the platform as a result.Users would then need sign into the home Wi-Fi of the primary location at least once every 31 days to ensure their device is not blocked. Temporary codes would need to be used for traveling members, which would only remain valid for seven consecutive daysNetflix said it would use information such as IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity to determine whether a device signed into the account is connected to the primary location.Smartphone with Netflix logo is placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken April 19, 2022. REUTERS/Dado RuvicIn a recent survey, investment firm Jefferies highlighted concerns surrounding the company's crackdown on password sharing, particularly among the account freeloaders Netflix hopes to convert.According to lead analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, about 62% of the 380 Netflix password borrowers surveyed said they would stop using Netflix once the crackdown takes effect.Only 10% of those polled said they would move to create their own account for $9.99 a month, hinting password borrowers don't see enough value in the platform. The survey also suggested competitors could greatly benefit from Netflix's crackdown.Some 35% of respondents said they can replace Netflix with another service, while another 31% added they don't enjoy the content enough to justify paying for it.Story continuesWhen asked which platforms users would use more frequently if they eliminated Netflix, the top streaming alternatives included Amazon Prime Video (42%), Hulu (35%), and Disney+ (26%).(Source: Jefferies)In its quarterly letter to shareholders published last month, Netflix said it would be intensifying its push to combat password sharing in Q1, although the streamer did not provide details on when exactly that would occur and what countries would be impacted.""Later in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business,"" the company wrote.Netflix's password crackdown, coupled with its recently launched ad-supported tier, have been looked at as meaningful profitability drivers, especially as competition within the streaming space escalates: ""As always, our north stars remain pleasing our members and building even greater profitability over time.""Netflix reported subscriber net additions of 7.66 million in Q4, above company guidance for 4.5 million amid a slew of high-profile and record-breaking content releases, including ""Glass Onion,"" ""Troll,"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""My Name is Vendetta,"" and ""Wednesday.""(Courtesy: Netflix)""The bottom line is there's a massive amount of password sharing, particularly among affluent people,"" Jason Helfstein, head of internet research at Oppenheimer, told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Monday.""We do think a good chunk of [Netflix] subscribers will probably pay more to keep certain members of their household, or let's say their children who no longer live with them, on their plan,"" he continued.Helfstein, who described the crackdown as a ""net positive"" in the long term, added Netflix, ""would not be doing this if they thought they would end up in a worse revenue situation.""""This is a company that historically has prided itself on customer service, above all,"" Helfstein said.""The reality is people have taken advantage of it. Sharing your Netflix account with 20 other people is probably not what the company had in mind, [but] if people are reasonable and share this with five, six people in their family?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +14.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 12.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -21%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. This estimate has changed +4.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.28 indicates a change of +28.3% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NFLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $8.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.9%. The $34.15 billion and $38.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8% and +11.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $7.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $0.12 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was -74.47%.Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +172.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +15.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $14.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -20.7%. This estimate has changed +5.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.84 indicates a change of -13.9% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +13.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Phillips 66.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate of $35.14 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.3%. The $144.74 billion and $130.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.6% and -9.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $40.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.9%. EPS of $4 for the same period compares with $2.94 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +19.26%. The EPS surprise was -7.83%.Over the last four quarters, Phillips 66 surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

115,c71559c0-d993-388d-bee4-411571d64bf4,TJX,2023-02-08,4 Retail Discount Stocks That Warrant Attention Despite Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-retail-discount-stocks-warrant-141502778.html,1675779302,STORY,"['BURL', 'COST', 'TGT', 'TJX', '^GSPC']","[Ongoing inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering lately. Also, rising prices are squeezing consumers’ disposable income, depleting personal savings and dampening demand. With the desperate need to tame inflation, the Federal Reserve is raising the benchmark interest rate. But a higher interest rate environment is not good news for consumer-centric industries.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Burlington Stores, Inc. BURL.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys and seasonal décor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Story continuesConsumer Confidence Slackens: Escalating prices and rising interest rates continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity and confidence. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 107.1 in January from December’s upwardly revised reading of 109.0. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. But rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The consumer price index rose to 6.5% in December 2022 on a year-over-year basis, albeit at a slower rate when compared with November.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in the low-to-middle income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products as well as enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. They are trying to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in the renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #186, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of November 2022, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 8.7%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail–Discount Stores industry has outpaced the broader Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively risen 2.1% compared with the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decline of 9.8%.

During this period, the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, which Newmont falls in, has remained unchanged.

Highways have been blockaded throughout the copper-rich south, threatening production and transport of the metal, hitting some company shares, and boosting already high prices.But the data suggests mining activity has been resilient, at least for now.This includes massive deposit Las Bambas, owned by China's MMG Ltd, which previously said it would have to halt production from Feb. 1, and Glencore's Antapaccay, which stopped production in mid-January but has since resumed.The power data from COES, which represents firms in Peru's energy sector, shows that nearly all major mines are drawing normal or near-normal levels of electricity. The data has traditionally been a reliable indicator of mining activity.GRAPHIC: Peru Mines: Power use (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/zjpqjwqokvx/chart.png)A source close to Las Bambas said the mine, which previously said it faced a production halt from Feb. 1 due to key provisions not reaching the mine, said it had been able to keep operating at a minimum level after getting ""last minute supplies.""The mine, which normally supplies some 2% of global copper, has been hit by regular blockades for years, usually causing its power use to fall sharply during the periods of disruption. This has not yet happened this time around, despite the protests.Story continuesThe person added, however, that the mine risked fully running out of supplies by Wednesday, which would force it to move into a ""care and maintenance"" mode with its machinery that would use half the normal level of power.GRAPHIC: Las Bambas: Power and protest 9https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/gdvzynngzpw/chart.png)The data shows some mines experienced temporary dips in power use in recent months, including Peru's largest mine Antamina, co-owned by Glencore and BHP, and Glencore's Antapaccay around the middle of January.Antapaccay reopened on Jan. 31 after a temporary halt and has been operating again at full capacity.Hudbay Mineral Inc's Constancia mine has seen power use start to decline recently. Others, like Freeport-McMoRan's Cerro Verde are at normal or elevated levels. A combined index of six key mines is near normal.Freeport-McMoRan spokesperson Linda Hayes said: ""We are continuing to operate, but have limited our mill throughput by about 10% to deal with intermittent supply disruptions.""The other firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment about activity at their mines in Peru.The mining activity is key to keeping global copper supply flowing. Brokerage Jefferies said in a Jan. 31 note that some 30% of Peruvian copper supply was at risk from the unrest, a ""potential positive for the copper price.""The protests - which have led to the deaths of 48 people and are the worst violence Peru has seen in over 20 years - could of course soon start to have a greater effect on mining operations. Demonstrators are becoming more determined as lawmakers struggle to agree on calling snap elections, a key protest demand.This week, Peru's Buenaventura suspended operations at a key silver mine after protesters invaded the site.At a blockade on the ""mining corridor"" highway, protester Wilber Toco Aragua Salcedo told Reuters that people felt like the mines took all the wealth and left little for locals.""The south is quite rich, but the mining concessions that we have harm the people,"" he said, adding he had heard mines were stocking up on supplies. ""The people do not get tired, the people won't go away, we will not take a step back.""GRAPHIC: Peru: mines and power 9https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/byvrlkoxave/chart.png)(Reporting by Alex Villegas in Espinar and Adam Jourdan in Buenos Aires; Additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder, Melanie Burton, Valentine Hilaire and Fabian Cambero; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Bernadette Baum)]"

The second stock pays out in February, May, August, and November. And finally, the third stock will pay its dividend in March, June, September, and December.As we can see, this type of portfolio would undoubtedly be attractive to income-focused investors.The combination of three Dividend Aristocrats – Cardinal Health CAH, General Dynamics GD, and Archer Daniels Midland ADM – would allow investors to reap a monthly income stream.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.Archer Daniels Midland Archer Daniels Midland is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients and goods made from various agricultural products. The company’s dividends are paid in March, June, September, and December.Currently, the company’s annual dividend yields roughly 2%, below the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.While the yield is below its sector average, ADM’s commitment to shareholders through 25+ years of increased dividend payouts puts its reliable nature on full display.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Archer Daniels Midland’s earnings outlook has improved across all timeframes as of late, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCardinal Health Inc.

131,8a3b408e-25b0-3c5b-86c5-0b6f53cbf54a,NOV,2023-02-08,Are NOV Inc.'s (NYSE:NOV) Mixed Financials The Reason For Its Gloomy Performance on The Stock Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nov-inc-nyse-nov-mixed-101430928.html,1675851270,STORY,['NOV'],"[With its stock down 4.1% over the past week, it is easy to disregard NOV (NYSE:NOV). We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. Specifically, we decided to study NOV's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for NOV How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NOV is:3.0% = US$155m ÷ US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.03 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of NOV's Earnings Growth And 3.0% ROEIt is quite clear that NOV's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 10%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. NOV was still able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the past five years. Therefore, the growth in earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the growth figure reported by NOV compares quite favourably to the industry average, which shows a decline of 4.1% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about NOV's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is NOV Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?The really high LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 706% for NOV suggests that the company is paying its shareholders more than what it is earning. In spite of this, the company was able to grow its earnings respectably, as we saw above. That being said, the high payout ratio could be worth keeping an eye on in case the company is unable to keep up its current growth momentum.Besides, NOV has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 10% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in NOV's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 9.7%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about NOV's performance. While the company has posted impressive earnings growth, its poor ROE and low earnings retention makes us doubtful if that growth could continue, if by any chance the business is faced with any sort of risk. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis animal health company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15%.Revenues are expected to be $2.01 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zoetis?For Zoetis, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.87%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zoetis will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zoetis would post earnings of $1.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of -2.42%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zoetis doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.29%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.78%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 4.94%.Heading into today, shares of the power company had gained 6.25% over the past month, outpacing the Utilities sector's loss of 2.29% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.64% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from NRG Energy as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.43, up 247.42% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.67 billion, up 23.09% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for NRG Energy should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

(NYSE:NEE) should definitely note that the Independent Director, John Stall, recently paid US$74.89 per share to buy US$300k worth of the stock. We reckon that's a good sign, especially since the purchase boosted their holding by 101%. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Kirk Hachigian for US$702k worth of shares, at about US$70.22 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$76.08. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.While NextEra Energy insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell.

The parent of Florida Power and Light has added 25% to that backlog in the last year, executives have said.The company's business providing services to other utilities expanding into clean technologies will give it an added boost from the IRA, said Michael Doyle, senior equity analyst for utilities at brokerage firm Edward Jones.Duke, which has directed 80% of its five-year $63 billion capital plan towards clean energy, also stands to be a major benefactor.""What the IRA does is it lowers costs for customers,"" said Duke spokesman Neil Nissan. Duke also owns the largest U.S. nuclear fleet, which will see new advantages under the IRA, he added.NextEra and Dominion were not immediately available for comment.Story continuesWhere utilities are located will help determine how much they can gain from the IRA, said Emily Beagle, research associate at Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin.Solar projects in sunny states in the south and southwest and wind projects in the Midwest are among the best situated to collect IRA dollars, she said. One caveat is the greater the rate-paying population, generally the better off the utility.Developers are expected to add nearly 55 gigawatts of utility-scale electric generation this year, with more than half coming from solar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Smaller utilities and cooperatives are not completely left out. They stand to benefit from the IRA's direct-pay provisions, Beagle said.The full impact of climate-friendly incentives will likely take a ""few years"" to arrive, said Michael Haggarty, associate managing director, Moody’s Investors Service.(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

Now, I will turn the call over to Donnie.Donnie King: Thank you, Sean and thank you to everyone on the call for joining. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter 2023 results. We delivered solid top line results with year-over-year revenue and volume growth and continued strength in our share position, providing momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. Compared to record performance in the prior year, first quarter earnings declined driven by weaker results in chicken, pork and beef, which more than offset strong performance in Prepared Foods. It's important for you to know that we are uniquely positioned to win in an attractive global protein market. We have market leading brands across diverse portfolio that resonate with consumers as proven by our year-over-year sales and volume growth.We serve an estimated one-fifth of U. S. protein consumption and we are well positioned to meet consumer demand, which remains steady despite a challenging macroeconomic environment with ongoing elevated levels of inflation. As we navigate a complex and dynamic operating environment, I am grateful for our team members whose hard work and dedication make our business operations possible. Five key pillars of our strategy are: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service demand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. In service of these long-term strategic imperatives, I'd like to emphasize that we continue to deliver on our commitments of growing volume by filling up our footprint, solving labor problems, investing in automation, and building inventory to meet customer demand with improved fill rates all while maintaining a focus on liquidity and financial health.We are confident these investments will pay dividends over the long run and we remain committed to methodically executing our growth strategy driving long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our results and shed some light on some of the challenges and outlook. We went into Q1 with a good plan, but our overall results were impacted by a confluence of factors, including consumer and customer demand dynamics and the curve of the beef cycle, among other things. Allow me to touch on each segment. As we have previously mentioned to you, we have been expecting beef to come under pressure for some time. With higher cattle prices, we expected overall harvest to slow down, but that hasn't happened yet. As such, we continue to draw on the herd, which continues to decline.This is putting pressure on spread margin in the business. We tightened our outlook range for the year. For pork, when you account for mark-to-market derivatives in the number, we flip back to breakeven as expected, but given continued supply and demand dynamics, we lowered our outlook for the year by 200 basis points. For chicken, when compared to expectations from last quarter, a few different things didn't go as planned. Most notably, demand didn't appear in the parts of the market where we had expected. As a result, we had to move things around and we experienced higher cost, a lower price environment and knock-on effects from a network standpoint. And last, it's worth emphasizing our Prepared Foods segment, which delivered a great result for the quarter.We said we were going to grow dollar share and volume share with the strongest portfolio of brands in the categories where we compete and we have done just that. We are feeling good about the outlook for the balance of the year. And our international business continues to build momentum in terms of volume and sales growth. With the end of COVID lockdowns, particularly in China, we expect good year-over-year comps. We will dive deeper into this during the discussion of segment results and the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Now, let's turn to our growth numbers. Sales improved 2.5% year-over-year. And as we delivered record first quarter revenue for a total company and individually in chicken, Prepared Foods and International Other, we are focused on driving growth in these segments, which will enhance our margin profile over time.We continue to see benefits of our efforts to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. Prepared Foods revenues increased 8.8% for the quarter driven by both volume growth and pricing actions implemented in the prior year. Positive momentum continues to build in Prepared Foods, as it delivered sequential quarterly improvement in revenue since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. Beef revenue was down 5.6% compared to prior year. Lower average sales price driven by the decreased value of beef cut out more than offset the increased volume from higher headcount throughput. Compared to prior year, pork revenue was down 6% for the quarter.This was driven by decreased volume due to balancing supply with customer demand, partly offset by increase in average sales price. Chicken revenue increased 9.6% compared to prior year driven by volume growth from increased domestic production and pricing initiatives and an elevated inflationary cost environment. In international, revenue growth remained strong, up 11.3% compared to prior year quarter. This was driven by our investment in capacity, innovation and brand to support market share growth. In the next few slides, we will detail our success winning in retail marketplace with our advantaged brands in advantaged categories. The retail categories in which we participate are highly consumer relevant with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre-pandemic and demonstrating growth over the prior year.With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and BallPark, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth, up 9% relative to a year ago per Nielsen. Tyson core business lines also grew pound share by 2 points this quarter relative to year ago for Nielsen, continued to be market share leader in most of the retail core categories in which we compete. We delivered both dollar and pound share growth in both the aggregate and across day parts compared to a year ago, most notably in the morning meal occasion. Our brands continue to perform well as we see elasticities below historical levels. Additionally, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and BallPark, all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete, highlighting our brand strength relative to our peers.Consumers spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson Core business lines volume share growth shows, the recovery we have seen since April and the momentum we now have. We have improved fill rates and on-shelf availability. Price gaps relative to competitors have narrowed while we continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands. These factors, along with other strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in Tyson core business lines commanding a 5-year record high market share of nearly 28%. It is evident we are delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. While the foodservice industry is yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is outperforming pre-pandemic volume sales, up 2.7 and 1.7 share points in the latest 52 weeks according to NPD SupplyTrack data.The Tyson Focus 6 group is also outpacing both total broadline and its respective categories, up 11.7% in volume sales and 0.6 share points in the latest 52 weeks compared to last year per NPD. We believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident in the path to continue to grow this business as we align with key growing customers to build momentum for the future. Our team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers' demand. We are seeing business results from making significant investments to become the most sought after place to work by investing in our team members' experience. Recent highlights include expanding access to benefits with Day 1 eligibility, enhanced parental leave policies, expanding mental health benefits and citizenship support at no cost to our U.S. team members.In November, as recognition for our Tyson immigration program's commitment to improving the lives of immigrant team members, we received the prestigious Keepers of the American Dream award from the National Immigration Forum. We also just completed what we have been calling Project Next Frontier. We are setting the foundation for an HR shared service model focused on process and system efficacy and better overall HR service delivery for our team members, setting us up for savings in the future. I am pleased to report we are also progressing as expected with our North American headquarters consolidation focused on building our OneTyson culture. In addition to realizing savings, we are collaborating, innovating and working with greater speed and agility to serve our customers.I would also like to thank our team members for their dedication that led to Tyson Foods number one ranking on Fortune Magazine's list of the world's most admired companies in food production category for the seventh consecutive year. Following the strong outperformance of expectation in fiscal 2022, the productivity program is on track to meet expectations this fiscal year and to deliver the $1 billion of recurring savings commitment a year earlier than originally promised. We expect this program to translate from a onetime initiative to sustained year-on-year productivity improvements, supporting our bottom line on a continued basis. Examples of initiatives in our productivity program include leveraging data analytics to improve inventory visibility, mitigating distressed pounds, a direct plant shipment program, which continues to bring on new customers and categories, removing miles from the roads and driving efficiency in our distribution network.This is an example of how our scale drives competitive advantage. Investing heavily in automation, we recently rolled out automated sandwich hand wrap and burrito assembly capabilities as well as an automated line to serve snacking production. We have also continued to scale our chicken debone automation across multiple facilities and we are piloting a robotic tray pack machine that is showing promising results, expanding our smart factory program to digitize our plants to new sites as well as exploring opportunities to digitize our processes. Our progress displays how Tyson remains focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing the supply chain increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&amp;A across our operations. Before I turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the quarter some final comments.Our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio strategy to deliver sustainable, high-quality growth at good value. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins and channels around the world. We have products for consumers across proteins and price points, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable return for shareholders. We are modernizing our operations with our productivity program and are building a team positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Again, we entered Q1 with a good plan to execute our strategy. That led to solid top line growth and strong performance in Prepared Foods. Market dynamics and some operational inefficiencies impacted our profitability.We see opportunities to become more agile and efficient, which will further improve our operational execution. We remain committed to executing our growth strategy and are confident we will grow volume, revenue and operating income in the back half of fiscal year 2023 and have a long runway of growth ahead of us. With that, I will turn the call over to John.John Tyson: Thanks, Donnie. First, let's review a summary of our total company financial performance then we can dive deeper into the detail for the individual segments. As Donnie stated, sales were up year-over-year for the first quarter, benefiting from both volume growth and disciplined revenue management to offset elevated inflationary increases in our cost of goods. Looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove $324 million of top line improvement led by Chicken and Prepared Foods. Our industrial and other channel sales increased by $108 million, led by beef and chicken and this was offset by slight decreases in sales to the foodservice and international channels. As expected, given the record strength of beef a year ago, we delivered lower adjusted operating income in the prior year of $453 million.This translated to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. Now, turning to the adjusted operating income bridge, we significantly grew Prepared Foods earnings in the quarter, but underperformance in chicken, pork and beef led to $979 million lower operating income compared to the prior year. While pricing actions led to an improvement of $222 million, higher input costs per pound increased cost of goods sold by $1.3 billion. About two-thirds of this increase was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and supply chain costs. The remainder was primarily due to a shift to producing more value-added mix, higher labor costs and unfavorable derivative impact. Excluding the impact of restructuring, SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of sales was down to 3.7% from 4.3% in the prior fiscal year as we continue to eliminate non-value-added spend across our business while investing to support the future growth of our brands.Food, Restaurant, ServicePhoto by Jay Wennington on UnsplashOur productivity program continues to play a critical role in the long-term improvement of our margin profile. Now to the individual segment results. Starting with the Beef segment, sales in the quarter remained strong at more than $4.7 billion, but were down 5.6% compared to record high sales in the prior year. Volume gains of 2.9% were supported by improved staffing for higher throughput, while the average sales price was down 8.5% due to softer domestic demand for Beef. Live cattle costs increased approximately $530 million in the quarter as cattle supplies continue to tighten. Net-net, segment operating income for beef was $129 million for an operating margin of 2.7% off the previous year's historical record first quarter margin of 19%.We saw higher cattle prices as beef herd numbers continue to decline. We will continue to monitor the beef cutout value and balance our supply with customer demand during a period of margin compression while pushing volume growth in case-ready and premium branded products. Although the near-term operating environment remains challenging, we have reasons to believe in our long-term outlook for beef. This outlook is supported by our investment in strategic supplier relationships that provide higher quality beef, a growing global demand, specifically in Asia, and the strengthening drop credit as well as opportunities to shift our beef products up the value pyramid. Now, let's look at the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter, down 6% for the record high in the prior year.Average sales price gains of 1.4%, mostly driven by higher value specialty products were offset by volume decreases of 7.4%. International demand for U.S. pork products continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, while domestic demand is being affected by high retail prices despite the cutout realigning to historical norms. However, we are optimistic that when these factors normalize, demand will improve. We expect to see continued industry supply challenges in the fiscal year as the producer navigates herd health issues and higher input costs. On expenses, we incurred greater cost as lean hog costs increased approximately $55 million over the prior year. We also experienced an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of $35 million.Segment operating income was lower than expected at a loss of $19 million for the quarter, down from a profit of $160 million in the prior year. As we move forward, pork margins should be supported over time with the normalization and the strength of the U.S. dollar aiding future export demand, a strengthening drop credit and additional opportunity to shift pork products up the value pyramid, especially into our case-ready business. Now, let's move on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were a record first quarter high at $4.3 billion, up 9.6% from the prior year. The sales increase was attributable to a 2.5% uptick in volume and 7.1% gain in pricing compared to the prior year quarter. Volume gains are due to a combination of strategic choices to maximize our capacity utilization and pursue an optimal mix strategy with products and customers.Our pricing results while improved were lower than expected. We pegged this to a combination of factors that influence chicken prices, mostly related to total protein availability, notably chicken and beef. We anticipate these factors easing in the back half of 2023 as beef availability lessened and total poultry harvest normalizes, providing support for improvement in our chicken prices. The fall in commodity chicken prices driven by heightened protein supply in the market and seasonal demand weakness does not change our strategy. Based on current USDA industry placement data, we are optimistic on our forward-looking supply conditions in the intermediate term. We intend to grow our domestic production to 42 million head per week during this fiscal year, which should enable us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share.We will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our Chicken segment, particularly by growing our portfolio of value-added products, which remain in high demand. Operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $225 million of higher feed ingredient costs and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $40 million. Net-net, our Chicken segment delivered operating income of $77 million in the first quarter. We see significant room for improvement in the long-term operating margin of our Chicken segment as there is still work to do to attain industry leading performance and we are optimistic it can be achieved due to the following: our diversified value-added portfolio with lower margin volatility, our brand strength with the highest consumer awareness and brand loyalty according to Nielsen data, our growth strategy, taking advantage of existing capacity, optimization of our portfolio by shifting from commodity to value-added products, and last, a further implementation of our productivity program as we ramp up more automation.Last, I want to turn to our Prepared Foods business. In this segment, we had a solid quarter with growth in both revenue and volume. This was driven by strong brands, increased support for our customers and pricing aimed at recovering the continued inflation. Revenue was approximately $2.5 billion for a record first quarter, up 8.8% compared to the prior year. Volume gains of 1.2% were driven by strength in retail, notably Jimmy Dean and improved customer fulfillment despite decreased volumes in foodservice. This quarter was our third sequential quarter of volume growth and we saw significant pricing power of our portfolio with a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. Driven by top line growth and productivity savings, we delivered segment operating income of $266 million for the quarter.The operating margin of 10.5% was up from 8% in the prior year. We are very pleased with the performance of this quarter in Prepared Foods, as this segment is critical to drive profitable growth for Tyson by valuing of Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products. We continue to be optimistic for the outlook of this segment due to the following. Our diversified portfolio meets consumers across meal eating occasions and snacking occasions in all sales channels. We are outperforming our competition in retail with room to grow further market household penetration. Our comprehensive foodservice portfolio has opportunity to grow by regaining lost customers and broadening our customer base. We have got additional operational efficiencies to unlock by increasing plant utilization in addition to the implementation of our various productivity initiatives.And finally, we have an opportunity to innovate, expand and acquire into new spaces through new offerings, the growth of our existing products, and attractive disciplined approach to M&amp;A. Now, turning to talk about our financial position. Building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. We produced operating cash flows of $762 million for the quarter and our leverage ratio finished the quarter at 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our commitment to a sound balance sheet. Focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives, we invested nearly $600 million into our business in the first quarter to capitalize on projected demand growth over the next decade.Investment in the business, both organically and inorganically, is expected to generate returns at or above our 12% return on invested capital target over time. Our capital allocation priorities are first to invest in growth and productivity in our existing footprint. Then we will employ a disciplined M&amp;A approach by investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio. Next, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we will continue to support and grow the dividend for our shareholders as evidenced by its continuous payment since 1977 and annual increases each fiscal year since 2013. Our approach to share buybacks will continue to be managing for dilution and entering the market opportunistically when assessing for multiple factors.We returned nearly $500 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter through $169 million in dividends and $313 million of share repurchases. At Tyson, we utilize a disciplined capital allocation approach to invest in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and we returned cash to shareholders while maintaining a robust balance sheet. Now, let's turn to the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $55 million to $57 billion, which implies a 3% to 7% sales growth for the year. Supported by the factors detailed earlier, we expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% in the long-term. However, based on current market dynamics, we now expect to perform between 2% and 4% this fiscal year.Given the result in pork in the first quarter, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between 0% and 2%. Counter to normal seasonality for our pork segment, we expect the back half of the year to outperform the first half of the year. For our poultry business, we now expect full year margins to be between 2% and 4%, but gaining momentum through the year and exiting the fourth quarter at a margin above this range. Prepared Foods had a strong first quarter in performance as this is historically normal seasonality for the segment we are maintaining our expected full year margin performance to be between 8% and 10%. In international, we continue to see volume and sales growth year-over-year, and we anticipate improved profitability in fiscal 2023, driven by volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up.We remain committed to growing our business internationally, representing the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Our expectation for CapEx for the remainder of the year is unchanged at approximately $2.5 billion. Our expectations for productivity savings remain unchanged at $300 million to $400 million. Our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $330 million and 24%, respectively. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating and managing our net leverage ratio to be at or below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the long-term, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders. In summary, we had a slower start than expected, but are optimistic on the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and long-term.We have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity and a differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. Overall, we see some persistent market factors, some operational challenges, and some expected seasonality influencing our second quarter results. And therefore, we're expecting total company volume, revenue and operating income to be meaningfully stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. We remain in the strong financial position to support continued investment in our existing footprint, productivity and the support of our brands as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders. So with all that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&amp;A instructions.Sean Cornett: Thanks, John. We will now move on to your questions.

Highways have been blockaded throughout the copper-rich south, threatening production and transport of the metal, hitting some company shares, and boosting already high prices.But the data suggests mining activity has been resilient, at least for now.This includes massive deposit Las Bambas, owned by China's MMG Ltd, which previously said it would have to halt production from Feb. 1, and Glencore's Antapaccay, which stopped production in mid-January but has since resumed.The power data from COES, which represents firms in Peru's energy sector, shows that nearly all major mines are drawing normal or near-normal levels of electricity. The data has traditionally been a reliable indicator of mining activity.GRAPHIC: Peru Mines: Power use (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/zjpqjwqokvx/chart.png)A source close to Las Bambas said the mine, which previously said it faced a production halt from Feb. 1 due to key provisions not reaching the mine, said it had been able to keep operating at a minimum level after getting ""last minute supplies.""The mine, which normally supplies some 2% of global copper, has been hit by regular blockades for years, usually causing its power use to fall sharply during the periods of disruption. This has not yet happened this time around, despite the protests.Story continuesThe person added, however, that the mine risked fully running out of supplies by Wednesday, which would force it to move into a ""care and maintenance"" mode with its machinery that would use half the normal level of power.GRAPHIC: Las Bambas: Power and protest 9https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/gdvzynngzpw/chart.png)The data shows some mines experienced temporary dips in power use in recent months, including Peru's largest mine Antamina, co-owned by Glencore and BHP, and Glencore's Antapaccay around the middle of January.Antapaccay reopened on Jan. 31 after a temporary halt and has been operating again at full capacity.Hudbay Mineral Inc's Constancia mine has seen power use start to decline recently. Others, like Freeport-McMoRan's Cerro Verde are at normal or elevated levels. A combined index of six key mines is near normal.Freeport-McMoRan spokesperson Linda Hayes said: ""We are continuing to operate, but have limited our mill throughput by about 10% to deal with intermittent supply disruptions.""The other firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment about activity at their mines in Peru.The mining activity is key to keeping global copper supply flowing. Brokerage Jefferies said in a Jan. 31 note that some 30% of Peruvian copper supply was at risk from the unrest, a ""potential positive for the copper price.""The protests - which have led to the deaths of 48 people and are the worst violence Peru has seen in over 20 years - could of course soon start to have a greater effect on mining operations. Demonstrators are becoming more determined as lawmakers struggle to agree on calling snap elections, a key protest demand.This week, Peru's Buenaventura suspended operations at a key silver mine after protesters invaded the site.At a blockade on the ""mining corridor"" highway, protester Wilber Toco Aragua Salcedo told Reuters that people felt like the mines took all the wealth and left little for locals.""The south is quite rich, but the mining concessions that we have harm the people,"" he said, adding he had heard mines were stocking up on supplies. ""The people do not get tired, the people won't go away, we will not take a step back.""GRAPHIC: Peru: mines and power 9https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/byvrlkoxave/chart.png)(Reporting by Alex Villegas in Espinar and Adam Jourdan in Buenos Aires; Additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder, Melanie Burton, Valentine Hilaire and Fabian Cambero; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Bernadette Baum)]"

Payments vary from cargo to cargo, depending in part on the demands of specific traders, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details are private.Reliance, BPCL and Nayara didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The European Union’s recent ban on imports of refined oil products from Russia has positioned India as an increasingly important customer for the shipments. Russia has been India’s top crude supplier since June as cargoes previously bound for Europe have been diverted to Asia — often sold at well below the $60-a-barrel cap.The UAE dirham provides both Indian buyers and Russian sellers with a relatively predictable currency — pegged to the dollar — without the greenback’s potential sanctions complications. Even on deals that don’t directly violate US and EU restrictions, some intermediary banks often take additional steps to avoid any risks to other banking relationships abroad.India is the UAE’s second-largest trade partner and officials are working on a mechanism to boost trade in dirhams and rupees.Most oil deals are still being transacted in dollars. India’s oil minister said he was unaware of the use of dirham in oil purchases.“If you are asking me officially am I in the know of these payment channels, no, I’m not,” Hardeep Singh Puri said in a Monday interview in Bengaluru. Officials are open to holding discussion with other countries on the issue, he said. “If the need arises, we will need to talk.”Story continuesIndia is probably willing to accommodate requests from Russia to offer payment in dirham, considering the bargain prices offered on crude, according to Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights.Still, a move away from the US dollar could risk drawing the ire of some officials in Washington.

Expedia is out of the Retail-Wholesale sector and its Internet-Commerce Industry is currently in the top 15% of over 250 Zacks Industries.With travel demand expected to remain robust following the pandemic, Expedia stands to benefit through its web portals that focus on travel planning, travel purchases, and travel experience sharing that brings suppliers and consumers of travel-related services together.Furthermore, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) earnings estimate revisions have gone up 3% over the last quarter for Expedia’s fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out FY22.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Expedia’s Q4 earnings are expected at $1.85 per share, which would be a 74% increase from Q4 2021. Fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected to rebound 350% to $7.44 per share compared to EPS of $1.65 in 2021. Plus, fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to climb another 24% to $9.21 per share. On the top line, Q4 sales are forecasted to be $2.68 billion, up 18% from the prior year quarter. Total sales are now anticipated to be up 36% for FY22 and rise another 9% in FY23 to $12.78 billion. More importantly, Fiscal 2023 sales would be 6% above pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $12.06 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that Expedia could significantly top Q4 bottom-line estimates with the Most Accurate Estimate at $1.99 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $1.85.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesTakeaway: Expedia’s top and bottom line appear to be back on the path to continued growth and the rising earnings estimate revisions for FY23 are an indication that the company could also provide upbeat guidance in its outlook.Even better, Expedia stock is now up +36% to start the year and still trades at just 16.5X forward earnings. This is 56% below its decade-long high of 38X and a 21% discount to the median of 21X, suggesting there could be plenty of upside left in EXPE stock, especially with earnings on the rise.Lyft (LYFT)Another stock investors may want to consider buying this week is ride-hailing company Lyft which is also set to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, February 9.Lyft has remained focused on ride-sharing and building its multimodal transportation network in the United States and Canada while competitor Uber Technologies (UBER) is making a global push and implementing food transportation into its ride-hailing service along with freight transportation services.However, unlike Uber, Lyft is already profitable as its operating costs are a lot lower with its expansion centered around its core business. To that note, Lyft stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates have started to slightly go up again over the last 30 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Lyft’s Q4 EPS is expected at $0.10 a share, up 11% from $0.09 per share in Q4 2021. Even better, this would round out fiscal 2022 earnings at $0.41 per share, compared to EPS of -$0.25 a share in 2021 and FY23 earnings are projected to climb 120% to $0.90 per share.Fourth-quarter sales are forecasted to be $1.16 billion, up 19% from the prior year quarter. Total sales would be up 27% YoY for FY22 and are projected to jump another 19% in FY23 to $4.87 billion. Plus, with 2019 sales at $3.61 billion, FY23 would represent 35% growth from pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: Lyft is expected to top Q4 earnings expectations with The Zacks Consensus at $0.10 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus at $0.14 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Considering Lyft’s bottom line is already in the black, its stock looks very attractive at around $17 per share with Uber stock in comparison at $33 per share. While the traditional P/E valuation metric is not able to be used for Lyft or Uber stock yet, it is noteworthy that Lyft’s price to sales is more attractive at 1.2X Vs. Uber’s 1.8X and is also well below the S&amp;P 500’s 3.5X.Lastly, a strong Q4 earnings beat could continue to spark Lyft’s stock which has now rallied 83% off its December lows with shares up 62% YTD to crush the broader indexes’ strong start to the new year. Ralph Lauren (RL) Rounding out the list is premium apparel retailer Ralph Lauren out of the Consumer Staples sector which is set to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings on February 9.As a leading international designer, marketer, and distributor of clothing, footwear, accessories, and home furnishings among other product categories RL stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with annual earnings estimates trending higher again leading up to its quarterly report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Preview: Ralph Lauren’s fiscal Q3 earnings are expected at $2.91 per share, which would be a -1% dip from Q3 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are now projected to decline -7% to $7.75 per share compared to EPS of $8.38 in 2022.However, fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to rebound and climb 14% to $8.86 per share. On the top line, Q3 sales are forecasted to be $1.75 billion, down -3% from the prior year quarter. Total sales are now forecasted to be virtually flat in FY23 but rise 5% in FY24 to $6.58 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that Ralph Lauren could top its fiscal Q3 bottom-line estimates with the Most Accurate Estimate at $2.95 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $2.91.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: With Ralph Lauren’s stock trading attractively relative to its past from a valuation standpoint, a strong earnings beat would be a nice catalyst and could lead to more upside. Shares of Ralph Lauren have rallied 14% to start the year topping the S&amp;P 500’s +7% with RL stock trading at 15.6X forward earnings and well below its decade-long high of 242.3X and 10% beneath the median of 17.4X.Bottom Line These three stocks offer diversification in investment portfolios across multiple sectors and appear to have more upside left despite their strong performances to start 2023. The possibility of topping bottom-line expectations is also intriguing as strong earnings beats could be a further catalyst for Expedia, Lyft, and Ralph Lauren stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QuoteFactors to ConsiderExpedia’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from increased gross bookings owing to growing travel demand among people.EXPE has been witnessing an increase in room nights stayed across hotels and alternative accommodations.

This is expected to have driven its B2C and B2B businesses in the quarter to be reported.However, uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic persisting in the global travel industry are expected to have been a concern for Expedia.Increasing expenses related to sales &amp; marketing, and technology &amp; content are likely to have affected the quarter’s performance.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Expedia this time around.

158,5f182cd4-a9cf-3ba1-9cfb-b456901fd580,EXPE,2023-02-08,TripAdvisor (TRIP) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripadvisor-trip-earnings-expected-grow-150003650.html,1675782003,STORY,"['TRIP', 'EXPE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when TripAdvisor (TRIP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis travel website operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +600%.Revenues are expected to be $343.79 million, up 42.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TripAdvisor?For TripAdvisor, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +112.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that TripAdvisor will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TripAdvisor would post earnings of $0.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.28, delivering a surprise of -28.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TripAdvisor appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsExpedia (EXPE), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.85 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +74.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.68 billion, up 17.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Expedia has been revised 28.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 7.34%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggests that Expedia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

159,3906c730-5bb9-3448-911a-a87c6adbd484,EXPE,2023-02-08,3 Picks From a Strengthening Ecommerce Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-picks-strengthening-ecommerce-industry-130601497.html,1675775161,STORY,"['EXPE', 'BABA', '^GSPC', 'MELI']","[This year is likely to see a return to normalcy with ecommerce taking away bigger and bigger slices of the total retail pie. The trend started last year itself, as can be seen from the third-quarter (last-reported) data from the Commerce Department: ecommerce sales in the third quarter grew 10.8% over 3Q21 (up 3.0% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 9.1% (up 0.7% sequentially). Ecommerce accounted for around 14.1% of total U.S. retail sales. As the back-to-stores trend recedes, convenience is returning as a major factor driving volumes in this industry and this is particularly true of Gen-Z, which is becoming a more relevant contributor to sales. Many of these buyers have grown up on the Internet and take a much higher level of digitization as normalcy. They are also likely to hang out on popular social media platforms, allowing themselves to be influenced by the latest trends there. This is driving an entirely new perspective on the ecommerce space, one that is likely to expand with more advanced technology such as AR/VR and the Metaverse.   Valuation although down over the past year, remains expensive, reflecting the relatively stronger growth prospects. A large number of stocks in this extremely diverse industry are worth buying today, but we’ve picked three: Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), MercadoLibre (MELI).About The IndustryInternet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it advance.On the one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are sophisticated, AI-enabled software platforms facilitating transactions that are thereby, more capable of delivering user satisfaction. Social commerce and chatbots are further facilitating things.Differentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc. as well as more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players. Particularly because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting, which keeps prices down.Story continuesCurrent Trends Driving the Internet-Commerce IndustryMacro conditions should continue to improve for the industry, which has been mired for the most part in 2022 by a combination of factors, including a consumer trend back to stores, as well as generally tighter purse strings as people fretted about rising costs and the possibility of a recession that would see significant job losses. But things appear to be clearing up in 2023 with inflation coming down (however slowly), a recession looking less and less likely and people going back to the convenience of online shopping. To top it all, the jobs scenario looks as strong as ever despite the tech layoffs. For producers, supply chain issues have alleviated while the labor situation is still tight. Global uncertainties continue to affect foreign exchange effects for companies with international operations. The higher interest rate is another pressure on producers, and by extension consumers, which is another negative for the year. Therefore, the digital infrastructure that retailers have been building up in the last few years will disproportionately increase profitability this year. The importance of having a digital presence has never been greater, particularly considering the fact that the retail ecommerce market continues to expand into new product segments and geographies. Ecommerce will continue to gain at the expense of brick-and-mortar this year. The Commerce Department’s data for the last available quarter (3Q22) shows that ecommerce growth was already moving past overall retail sector growth in that quarter when the back-to-store trend was also operational. Therefore, this year is likely to be a relatively normal year, which means that ecommerce will continue to grow at the expense of physical stores. Shopify’s Michael Keenan agrees with this analysis. According to a recent statement of his, “Two years ago, only 17.8% of sales were made from online purchases. That number is expected to reach 20.8% in 2023, a 2-percentage point increase in e-commerce market share. Growth is expected to continue, reaching 23% by 2025, which translates to a 5.2 percentage point increase in just five years.” Ecommerce growing at the expense of physical stores doesn’t mean that a physical presence will be downgraded. In fact, with Gen Z entering the marketplace, the demand for convenience and options will remain paramount. In many cases, this will mean faster deliveries or pickups from some nearby convenient location. Since it is only proximity to a consumer that can facilitate quick delivery, both ecommerce pureplays and traditional retailers will continue to balance ecommerce sales with a physical presence. Therefore, a hybrid/omnichannel model will remain of utmost importance, allowing customized, quick and convenient delivery (BOPIS, curbside pickup) through apps. Customers generally downgrade stores that don’t provide these conveniences. Self-driven delivery vehicles and drones are also on the horizon to deal with logistics problems and make deliveries smoother and cheaper. A trend that Gen-Z is popularizing now is social commerce. Social commerce means the ability to discover, research, buy and checkout on a social media platform. Brands usually have store fronts on these platforms where influencers also discuss their products, thus driving traffic to them. The social element of shopping that ecommerce had taken out is thus returning through this route. Since social commerce is already popular in China, it isn’t surprising that the Chinese social media platform TikTok that’s also very popular with Gen Z is the number one place for social commerce. But others like Facebook and Instagram are also in the game. According to The Future of Commerce, “Global sales via social media platforms were estimated at 992 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, and forecasts suggest that social commerce sales will reach around 2.9 trillion U.S. dollars by 2026. Social commerce is critical for brands to reach their target audiences, and is expected to generate $30.73 billion in sales in 2023, accounting for 20% of global retail e-commerce.” Other trends online retailers are focused on include grocery sales and the buy-now-pay-later option. Also, data mining has never been easier. Because of the many details involved in satisfying a customer, data mining has grown in importance over the years, with the party controlling the customer’s data being best positioned to identify and service demand while also delivering the desired experience. Most of the big ecommerce players are also into payments processing, which gives them further insight into a customer’s tastes, preferences and buying habits. As machines read and process this data, they can createZacks Industry Rank Reflects Ongoing StrengthThe Zacks Internet - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And WholesaleSector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #34, which places it in the top 14% of 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates relatively strong near-term prospects.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of its relative performance versus others. What we’re seeing in the aggregate estimate revisions is significantly weaker earnings than a year ago. However, expectations for both 2022 and 2023 (2022 results are not all in yet) are off just 3 cents since October, indicating that the return-to-store trend is stabilizing. As things stand now, the aggregate earnings estimate for 2022 is down 38.4% and for 2023 is down 44.9%. Profitability is improving, despite constantly rising SG&amp;A, possibly because some of the store traffic related to the reopening has started moving back online. Supply chain and labor issues are also easing. A recession is looking increasingly unlikely, as employment numbers show no sign of softening, even as prices continue to cool.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags On Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry has lagged both the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 index though much of the past year although it has been doing notably better than both since December.Therefore, we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 26.1% of their value over the past year, compared to the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector, which lost 13.1% and the S&amp;P 500, which lost just 9.1%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the price-to-forward 12 months’ earnings (P/E) basis, the industry still looks grossly overvalued (34.34X) with respect to both the S&amp;P 500 (18.73X) and the broader retail sector (22.73X).On the basis of forward sales (P/S) for the year however, the industry trades at its annual low of 1.21X, which trails the sector’s 1.25X (close to its median level) as well as the S&amp;P 500’s 3.59X (also relatively close to its median value). Over the past year, the industry has traded as high as 1.87X, as low as 1.21X and at the median of 1.50X, as the chart below shows.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Sales (P/S) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Stocks Worth ConsideringWhile the industry’s valuation looks kind of prohibitive, there are quite a large number of stocks that are currently ripe for the picking. That’s because of the significant variety that exists in this industry in terms of lines of business, business model, location, and so forth. All of the following stocks carry a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy):Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA): Like Amazon in the U.S., Hangzhou PRC-based Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a leading provider of a whole range of products and services (retail, advertising, media and entertainment, cloud infrastructure), primarily through its Chinese and international ecommerce platforms. Other than online retail platforms like Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Alimama, 1688.com, Alibaba.com, etc. it owns and operates a retail chain called Freshippo, an import e-commerce platform called Tmall Global, an online-offline integration service for grocery and FMCG brands called Taoxianda, the Cainiao Network logistic services platform, etc. It has a platform to tap every opportunity in the ecommerce space in China, including the Taobao Ad Network and Exchange, a real-time online bidding marketing exchange and media businesses. It also provides elastic computing, storage, network, security, database and big data, and IoT services.Chinese stocks are benefiting from the lifting of draconian measures by the government to fight COVID last year. Alibaba in particular has done better than many others because of the breadth of its offerings and innovation at every level that have helped it retain customers and add new ones. This focus, along with capacity expansion, operating efficiency and cost optimization should translate into disproportionately stronger business flow now that the market is open. Macro concerns and global uncertainties remain, but these concerns aren’t specific to Alibaba.In the last 30 days, analysts have raised Alibaba’s 2023 (ending March) estimates by 7 cents and 2024 estimates by 30 cents.The shares have lost just 7.4% over the past year, a testimony to investor confidence.Price &amp; Consensus: BABAZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE): Seattle-based Expedia is an online travel company operating through Retail, B2B and trivago segments. It serves leisure and corporate travelers. Expedia takes bookings for hotel and alternative accommodation, cruise ships, rental cars, air tickets and such other services. Through Expedia Partner Solutions, a B2B brand and Egencia, it provides corporate travel management services. It also provides advertising and media services.As was evident through most of last year, vaccination has emboldened people, encouraging them to start traveling again. This took Expedia’s revenues to pre-pandemic levels. Growth should remain strong this year, not only because the pandemic is pretty much behind us, but also because there is some pent-up travel demand out there. The strong jobs numbers and softening inflation are also positive for travel sales this year. Expedia also has effective loyalty programs and its app-users are at all-time highs. Its focus on improving user experience through better web and app experiences will ensure that the user base continues to expand.Analysts have raised their 2023 estimates by 40 cents in the last 30 days.The Zacks Rank #1 stock is down 36.6% year to date, so there is much room for expansion.Price &amp; Consensus: EXPEZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research MercadoLibre, Inc. MELI: Buenos Aires, Argentina based MercadoLibre is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Latin America. Other than its online marketplaces, the company offers payments, advertising and logistics services.The company is seeing very strong growth in its served markets, driven by overall user experience, which is a function of the selection, pricing, logistics services (speed and cost of deliveries), customer service and technology. Its steadfast investments in these areas in the face of the back-to-stores trend in the last couple of years is clearly bearing fruit. This has allowed share gains in Brazil and Chile, resilience in Mexico and strong growth in Argentina. The payments business also continues to grow strongly with continued expansion of the user base. The volumes per device is the driving factor in MPOS with devices sales being a slight drag.In the last 30 days, analysts have raised their 2023 estimates by 60 cents. They are extremely optimistic about the company’s growth prospects.The shares are up 13.7% in the past year.Price Performance: MELI     Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore some of Ken Fisher's top dividend stock picks, you can go to 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher.Ken Fisher is an American billionaire investor, author, and philanthropist. He is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a Washington-based money management firm. Fisher is the author of eleven books, six of which are best-sellers. Fisher has received wide coverage for his analysis and investment philosophy and is also a noted philanthropist. As of February 6, 2023, Ken Fisher has an estimated net-worth of  of $7.2 billion.Ken Fisher's Market Outlook For 2023: ""The Midterm Miracle"", Recession, and InflationKen Fisher also runs a YouTube channel where he debunks investing myths and also offers his analysis of capital markets. On January 20, Ken Fisher shared his market outlook for 2023 and why he thinks the year may be good for stocks. Ken Fisher said that ""everything about 2022, makes 2023 look like it's going to be a pretty good year"" for stocks and he believes this because ""third years of U.S. presidents' terms, which is what 2023 is, tend to be overwhelmingly positive"". Ken Fisher said that in the history of the stock market, we have only had two instances of when the third years of U.S. presidents' terms were down years for the markets. Ken Fisher has a strong belief about ""the midterm miracle"" which he defines as the fourth quarter of the prior year, and the first two quarters of the next year. According to Ken Fisher's estimates, ""those nine months collectively are the most consistently profitable nine-month span in U.S. stock market history, positive 92% of history with an overall 20% positivity"". Ken Fisher backed his views by explaining that historically whenever the second year of the president's term was negative, the third year was surprisingly positive with ""big returns"". Here are some comments from billionaire Ken Fisher:Story continues""When you look at the first year of presidents' terms, they're positive about half the time and negative about half the time, in history. And when they've been positive, they've been pretty big most of the time. The second year, similarly so, not quite as much. (Positive) about half the time, often pretty big when they're positive, half the time not. But when that second year is negative,  the third year is like a spring board and the returns have been even higher, the average third year of presidents' term has returns that have averaged about 20%. The third-year returns when the second year is negative are over 30%, on average. These are big numbers and I don't want you to underestimate the power of that.""Ken Fisher also noted that ""there is this endless fear of recession"". Fisher said ""we're either in one, or we're not"" and explained why he thinks we are currently not in a recession. He said that the stock market is a prominent indicator of recession and noted that after the market bottomed at the close of Q3 2022, it ""has been rising through the fourth quarter"". Fisher said that ""if we're in recession now, it's got to be a mild one since sales, corporate revenue, and GDP are moving along just fine"". Moreover, ""lending remains robustly strong"" on a domestic and global basis, noted the billionaire. Ken Fisher believes that we cannot be in recession with ""robust lending"". Here are some comments from Ken Fisher about why he believes we are not in recession:""When businesses and people borrow short to intermediate term funds, they tend to spend them pretty quickly, they tend not to sit on them.  And that robust lending does not speak to a weak economy immediately ahead, it speaks to  sentiment being dour now. And sentiment being dour now is because the stock market was weak in 2022, and dour sentiment is a bullish feature looking forward.""Finally, Ken Fisher spoke his thoughts about inflation and why he believes it will continue to decelerate. According to Fisher, inflation is ""output pricing"". Fisher said that inflation is ""the final price you are paying to buy something in a store or wherever you buy it"". Ken Fisher made a distinction that inflation is the ""output price"" and not the price of raw materials or ""input prices"". Here are some comments from Ken Fisher about inflation:""The inflation war, no thanks to the Federal Reserve or other central banks, has largely already been won. Grain prices are down, crude oil prices are down, most metals are down, lumber prices are down, the prices of most of the inputs of things that we later buy as finished goods, those inputs have been falling. It only takes time for that to translate into a positive inflation effect. When I say positive inflation, winning the inflation war is not going back to the price of the final input prices that used to exist, it's returning to the kind of low-levels of inflation that we lived with for a very long time that nobody complained about. And that is not terribly far ahead in 2023, and is a terribly positive surprise for most everyone"".Ken Fisher believes that 2023 should be a positive year for capital markets and that ""the surprises should end up on the positive side"".This article will look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher, some of which include Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:JPM)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,088,792,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 0.73%Dividend Yield as of February 6: 2.84%On January 17, Citi analyst Keith Horowitz raised his price target on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Trading at about a TTM PE ratio of 11x and offering a forward dividend yield of 2.84%, as of February 6, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the best cheap dividend stocks in Ken Fisher's 13F portfolio.On January 13, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced strong earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $34.55 billion, up 18.08% year over year and ahead of consensus by $320.96 million. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”10.

It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

168,fe7e8ab9-f424-3f54-ab7b-be6da74fa44a,JNJ,2023-02-08,Catalent (CTLT) Surges on Rumors of Acquisition by Danaher,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/catalent-ctlt-surges-rumors-acquisition-150903561.html,1675782543,STORY,"['CTLT', 'DHR', 'JNJ', 'TMO']","[Shares of Catalent CTLT gained 19.5% on Monday on rumors of a potential acquisition by a life sciences company — Danaher DHR. The CTLT stock started its upward journey during pre-market trading on Feb 6, following a Bloomberg report on DHR’s interest in taking over the contract development and manufacturing company (CDMO).Per the same report, Bloomberg claims that Danaher has valued Catalent at a significant premium but hasn’t disclosed it yet. The expectation of a premium valuation for the CDMO company is likely to have sparked investors’ sentiments, causing a nearly 20% gain in stock price for CTLT in the last trading session.However, the report also states that it remains uncertain about any imminent acquisition deal and whether Catalent will be interested in any sale of its business.In the past three months, shares of Catalent have gained 56.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 14.2%. The S&amp;P 500 Index was up 8.3% in the period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSignificance of an AcquisitionCatalent has placed itself as a reliable CDMO partner for pharmaceutical/drug-maker companies in the past few years, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak. The company had formed partnerships with multiple COVID-19 vaccine makers — Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Moderna and AstraZeneca. Catalent provided several services supporting the speedy rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, Danaher has relied on inorganic activities to boost its competency. The company acquired several companies in the past couple of years to gain a strong foothold in the life sciences field. It is also planning to spin out its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segment to focus more on its core Life Sciences segment. Hence, addition of a CDMO company like Catalent looks in line with DHR’s goals. The acquisition may also help Danaher in becoming a one-stop solution for biopharma companies and competing well with its near competitor —  Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO.Story continuesWe note that Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of the key players in the Life Sciences Solutions segment.

However, the fourth quarter of 2022 saw two major M&amp;A offers — the acquisition of Abiomed by J&amp;J for $16.6 billion and the buyout of Horizon Therapeutics by Amgen for $27.8 billion. JNJ completed its acquisition in December last year, while Amgen’s deal is expected to be closed in the first half of 2023.After a dry patch of M&amp;A activities last year, the two blockbuster deals have boosted investors’ sentiments for an anticipated rise in M&amp;A activities in 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend capture strategy and past performance of high dividend stocks, and go directly to read Dividend Capture Strategy: 5 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in February. Dividend capture strategy is one of the most popular techniques employed by short-term investors. The strategy involves buying dividend stocks before their ex-dividend dates and selling them after receiving the payouts. Investors often follow this technique because it offers the potential for price appreciation. If the stock price increases after the payout, the investor can sell the stock for a profit. Moreover, this strategy can be a source to generate stable income in a short time, especially if the dividends are above-average.Dividend stocks’ returns over the years have shown their solid performance during inflationary periods. According to a report by AMG Funds, dividend payments of the S&amp;P 500 Index have grown at an annual average rate of 6% over the past five decades, which is well above the inflation rate in the US. The report cited data from Ned Davis Research and mentioned that since 1979, dividend-payers outplayed non-dividend companies in periods where 10-year Treasury was rising.When following a dividend investment strategy, investors seek stocks with healthy yields in order to supplement their income. Moreover, these securities also have a potential for capital appreciation and can help investors diversify their portfolios. In 2021, high-yield dividend stocks in the US Total Cap outperformed non-dividend payers by 39.6%, as reported by IHS Markit. Similarly, high-dividend stocks performed better than non-dividend stocks in developed Europe during the same year. In addition to dividend yields, shareholders also evaluate these stocks in light of the respective company’s financial health, growth prospects, and future dividend policy. With decades-long dividend growth streaks under their belt, dividend growers become investors’ top choices when the market is uncertain. Some examples of such stocks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 0.16%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMedtronic has been witnessing an adverse trend of procedure volume across its core business over the past few quarters, impacted by the choppy macroeconomic scenario globally in the form of supply chain disruption, a severe shortage of health professional labor and record level of inflationary pressure. The full impact of inflation with increased freight expense is expected to have been realized in Q3 of fiscal 2023.Considering how inflation of raw materials and freight has become severe over the past quarter, Medtronic had earlier stated that it would prioritize R&amp;D investments for future growth. This might have once again caused margin pressure in fiscal Q3.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteAdded to this, severe currency headwinds are expected to have affected profitability further. In this regard, on the fiscal Q2 earnings call, the company noted that the fiscal third quarter would have a currency headwind between $460 million and $510 million on revenues.The company noted that it is driving significant expense reduction to help offset lower revenues and continued inflation impact. Amid the macro-environmental headwinds in the form of inflation, China VBP, softer procedure volumes in certain markets and currency, the company claims to be laser-focused on driving operational and expense efficiencies.Overall, in the third quarter, Medtronic expects organic revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3%, implying strong sequential acceleration, driven by improved product availability based on new launches. The fiscal third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27, including a currency headwind of about 5 cents.Story continuesThe company’s Cardiovascular portfolio is expected to gain 4.75% to 5.25% organically on the continued rollout of Evolut FX and LINQ II. In cardiac rhythm management, the pacing business is expected to have generated strong sales.In the neuroscience portfolio, the company is expected to have an increased market share in Cranial and Spinal technologies. Demand for the company’s new spine implants is expected to have contributed to the growth. The strong adoption of the spine technology ecosystem, or Aible, AI-enabled surgical planning platform, the launch of the Catalyft expandable titanium interbody system and the rollout of enabling technologies are expected to have contributed to Q3 growth. The Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system, particularly, are expected to have performed strongly in the to-be-reported quarter.The company earlier expected its neuroscience revenues to grow in the range of 5.75% to 6.25% organically in Q3.In Medical Surgical and surgical robotics, Medtronic remains focused on the limited market release of the Hugo robot while it scales production. The company recently completed Hugo installations in several geographies like Denmark, France and Italy, which are likely to have added to the company’s Q3 top-line growth within this arm. However, according to Medtronic, given increased volume-based procurement in many of the Chinese provinces, medical surgical revenues are expected to be down 2% to 2.5% in Q3.In Diabetes, MDT might have faced some competitive pressure in the United States, which might have impacted growth severely. However, the company is expected to have seen significant growth in markets outside the United States on the increasing user base of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with the Guardian 4 sensor. According to Medtronic, Diabetes is expected to decline in the low single digits on an organic basis in fiscal Q3.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fiscal third-quarter total revenues of $7.50 billion suggests a 3.4% decline from the prior-year reported number. The consensus mark for earnings of $1.26 per share implies an 8% drop from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Medtronic this time around.

COP’s balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to. Also, it approved a $20-billion increase in the existing share repurchase program to $45 billion.However, COP is highly exposed to oil price fluctuations, which makes things challenging for the company.

Strengthening customer engagement on the company’s platform is a major positive. Further, Venmo’s improving monetization efforts and rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the total active accounts growth.Solid momentum across core peer to peer, merchant services, PayPal Checkout experiences remains a tailwind.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -5.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has lost 8.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, indicating a change of -34.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -17.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.6%. This estimate has changed -6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.62 indicates a change of +26% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.6%. The $58.53 billion and $62.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +6.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $13.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.62 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.65%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.75 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -26.32%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this genetic testing tools company would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.34, delivering a surprise of 17.24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Illumina , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $1.08 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.54%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.2 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Illumina shares have added about 3.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.1%.What's Next for Illumina?While Illumina has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Illumina: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.54 on $1.15 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.26 on $4.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Aligos Therapeutics, Inc.

The company's financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges such as amortization of acquired intangible assets among others that are listed in the itemized reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release, as well as the effects of currency translation. Management has excluded the effects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating performance, including in the non-GAAP measures related to our Core Illumina and GRAIL segments.

This compares with $517.80 million, or $1.32 per share, in last year’s third quarter. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $0.98 per share, according to figures compiled by Thomson Reuters, which sent the stock higher Tuesday afternoon.By brand, Vans and Dickies led the losses this quarter, with the footwear brand down 13% to $926.9 million in sales for Q3.

Benno Dorer noted that VF was “evaluating and deploying a series of strategic actions” to strengthen the company’s financial position.These actions include a review of “strategic alternatives” of the company’s Global Packs business, consisting of the Kipling, Eastpak and JanSport brands. “While these iconic and profitable businesses are strong contributors of value, VF is committed to ensuring they are optimally positioned to achieve their full potential while enhancing management focus on the company’s greatest strategic priorities,” the company noted in the earnings release.This move would be in line with a December report by Bloomberg, which cited people close to the talks who said a deal could value the backpack and apparel brand at close to $500 million.Story continuesWhat’s more, the company also said on Tuesday it will conclude a number of asset sales during the second half of this fiscal year, including the sale and leaseback of VF’s European headquarters in Stabio, Switzerland – which the company just announced in December would be expanding.“We are committed to improving execution through a sharpened focus on the biggest consumer opportunities and enhanced operational performance,” Dorer said in a statement. “Consistent with this objective, we are shifting resource priorities across the company, including by reducing the dividend, exploring the sale of non-core assets, cutting costs and eliminating non-strategic spend, while enhancing the focus on the consumer through targeted investments.”Looking ahead, the company is sticking to its previous guidance, with total revenues for fiscal 2023 expected to be up approximately 3% in constant dollars. For Vans, VF is expecting revenue to decline by high single digits, and the North Face is expected to be up at least 14% in constant dollars for the year.“We are confident these actions will enable a return to profitable and sustainable growth and, with that, strong shareholder value creation,” Dorer added.]"

Seana takes a look at the movers. What do you got?SEANA SMITH: So we've got three stocks up here, Dave. We have Chipotle, VF Corp, and Fortinet. So let's talk about a Chipotle, shares off just about 5%, following their disappointing earnings results. You're looking at pressure there on the stock. Revenue coming in essentially in line with the Street's expectations slightly, like 2.18 billion. Same store sales, though, did miss. We're looking at growth of just about 5%. That missed the Street's expectations. Profit also missed, $8.29. Estimate out there for $8.91.In terms of what we are seeing right now, CEO Brian Niccol mentioning in this earnings release the challenging and fluid macro environment could be a headwind here for Chipotle. Year to date, though, shares have certainly been on a tear. You're looking at gains of just about 24%.Let's take a look at VF Corp, the retailer here. The stock popping in extended trading, up just about 3%. Now this is the owner of North Face, Vans, just to name a few of those brands. Timberland is also included in this. Revenue and profit did beat the Street's expectations. The company also outlined some cost cutting measures here going forward. They also cut their quarterly dividend to about $0.30.In the earnings release or interim, CEO writing that the company is shifting its priorities across the firm here, exploring the sale of non-core assets, cutting costs, also eliminating non-strategic spend when we talk about companies pivoting a bit during this environment. Year to date, the shares fairly in positive territory. Over the past year, though, we're looking at significant losses, off just about 54%.Let's take a look at Fortinet, that stock up just about 15% here after-hours. A huge mover in extended trading. Taking a look at these results, strong full year sales forecast. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS beating the Street's estimates, coming in at $0.44. The estimate out there was for $0.39. Revenue a slight miss there, 1.28 billion. The estimate was for 1.29 billion.Story continuesBut the cybersecurity firm up about 10% since the start of the year. You're looking at a one-year chart here. That's actually in the red. You can see it dipping into negative territory there, off just about 12%. But again, a huge pop here after-hours with that stock up just about 16%. So certainly some names to keep in mind as we shift our focus, Dave, to tomorrow's opening bell.DAVE BRIGGS: And tomorrow, we get Disney, which I'm very excited for. But I want to throw it back to Chipotle because we also talked to Allie Canal earlier in the show about Sweetgreen. And I can't help but wonder if we're going to see some pullback with that little bit above McDonald's, that type of $15 entree, what that looks like for the rest of 2022.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, you would think that certainly will be a headwind and is a headwind for Chipotle at this point when you take into account the fact that consumers are pulling back on spending. They're trading down. McDonald's mentioned that in their release that they're actually one of the beneficiaries of that. Chipotle gets expensive, and it gets expensive very quickly. So I think more people are likely going to be trading down if, of course, the economy does worsen.DAVE BRIGGS: You go for the bowl or the burrito?SEANA SMITH: The bowl all the time. How about you?DAVE BRIGGS: I go to the bowl. I go barbacoa.SEANA SMITH: We agree again.DAVE BRIGGS: Get carnitas.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, you can't go wrong with the bowl.DAVE BRIGGS: Love me some Chipotle. All right.]"

This release also refers to ""adjusted"" amounts, a term that is described under the heading below ""Adjusted Amounts - Excluding Transaction and Deal Related Activities, Costs Related to Specified Strategic Business Decisions, Noncash Impairment Charges, Pension Settlement Charge and a Tax Item."" Unless otherwise noted, ""reported"" and ""adjusted"" amounts are the same.Constant Currency - Excluding the Impact of Foreign CurrencyThis release refers to ""reported"" amounts in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), which include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. This release also refers to ""constant dollar"" amounts, which exclude the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to constant currency amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.Discontinued Operations - Occupational Workwear BusinessOn June 28, 2021, VF completed the sale of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business was comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses: Red Kap®, VF Solutions®, Bulwark®, Workrite®, Walls®, Terra®, Kodiak®, Work Authority® and Horace Small®. The business also included a license for certain Dickies® occupational workwear products that were historically sold through the business-to-business channel. Accordingly, the company has reported the operating results and cash flows of the business in discontinued operations for all periods through the date of sale.Adjusted Amounts - Excluding Transaction and Deal Related Activities, Costs Related to Specified Strategic Business Decisions, Noncash Impairment Charges, Pension Settlement Charge and a Tax ItemThe adjusted amounts in this release exclude transaction and deal related activities associated with the acquisition of the Supreme® brand. Total transaction and deal related activities include integration costs of approximately $0.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude costs related to VF's business model transformation primarily driven by Corporate actions and resulting restructuring costs, and a transformation initiative for our Asia-Pacific regional operations.

The impairment charges were driven by non-operating factors including higher interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude a noncash pension settlement charge. The pension settlement charge resulted from the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was an action taken to streamline administration, manage financial risk associated with pension plans, and to transfer a portion of the liability associated with VF's U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. Total expense was approximately $92 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude a discrete tax benefit of approximately $95 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023 related to a favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act based on examinations by the IRS.Combined, the above items positively impacted earnings per share by $0.19 during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and negatively impacted earnings per share by $1.07 during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. All adjusted amounts referenced herein exclude the effects of these amounts.Reconciliations of measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors. The company also provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results. Additionally, the impact of the payment of taxes and interest related to the dispute with the IRS regarding the Timberland acquisition in 2011 has been excluded from fiscal 2023 adjusted cash flow from operations.Forward-looking StatementsCertain statements included in this release are ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

218,66308b70-d30d-3ea9-8c19-f024b9a5a6de,WFC,2023-02-08,Deploying Capital for Veteran Entrepreneurs,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deploying-capital-veteran-entrepreneurs-144500308.html,1675781100,STORY,"['WFC', 'WFC-PD']","[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 7, 2023 / During one of Xiaobo Guan's scouting drives around the Norcross, Georgia, area, it dawned on him that his newly acquired self-service car wash couldn't compete with the others in town. The competition was able to charge double, but Guan's machines were so old that he couldn't raise his prices - or capitalize on the potential of his new business. He needed funds to purchase upgraded equipment.Guan is not alone. According to SCORE Association, a network of business mentors, veterans represent 9.1% of all American small business owners and generate $1 trillion annually in receipts, but there is an estimated annual demand for $100 million in capital from veteran entrepreneurs who do not receive any kind of funding for their businesses. Guan was also struggling as a first-time business owner. ""It was really hard in the beginning,"" he said. ""I had no idea how to do things.""His situation did an about-face after he reached out to ACE (Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs), a community development financial institution, or CDFI, in Georgia. ""When I told them I was a disabled Army veteran, they said I qualified for a loan from the Veteran Loan Fund,"" Guan said.Specialized support for veteransThe Veteran Loan Fund matches military veterans and their spouses with affordable capital from one of its growing number of member CDFIs that currently include Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs (Georgia), Appalachian Community Capital (Virginia), Black Business Investment Fund (Florida), Business Impact Northwest (Washington), Colorado Enterprise Fund (Colorado), DreamSpring (New Mexico), Economic and Community Development Institute (Ohio), Justine Petersen (Missouri), Pathway Lending (Tennessee), PeopleFund (Texas), Pursuit (New Jersey), and Wisconsin Women's Business Initiative Corporation (Wisconsin). This includes loans with single-digit interest rates, financial education, and a professional network of accountants, lawyers, and experienced business owners.Story continuesMany veterans find that the skills they hone in the military - like operational leadership, discipline, and strategic planning - can be hard to translate into a resume in a way that makes sense to a hiring manager, said Grant Bennett, director of the Veteran Loan Fund and a U.S. Army and Texas Army National Guard veteran. However, those skills translate very well to small business ownership. ""Veterans make really good entrepreneurs,"" said Bennett.""Entrepreneurship can be a very rewarding career path as people transition out of the military, but veterans need more access to capital and expertise to operationalize their business plans,"" said Jenny Flores, head of Small Business Growth Philanthropy at Wells Fargo. ""We support the Veteran Loan Fund's vision for a more inclusive economy and are proud to offer seed funding for this national effort to boost veteran-owned businesses.""In addition to a $3.5 million loan to the Veteran Loan Fund from the company's Community Lending and Investment business, Wells Fargo provided a $1.5 million grant from its Open for Business Fund to make it possible for the CDFIs participating in the Veteran Loan Fund to offer affordable loans to eligible veterans and for the fund to break even.""When a CDFI like ACE borrows $1 million from the Veteran Loan Fund, they also receive a $100,000 grant,"" explained Bennett. ""They can use the grant money as loan loss reserves, on operational expenses to build out their veteran programs, or whatever they need to support their veteran programs, either on the balance sheet or operationally.""Since the launch of the fund, member CDFIs have deployed more than $18 million in loans, helping create or retain more than 1,400 jobs and providing close to 5,000 hours of free technical assistance.Wells Fargo, Tuesday, February 7, 2023, Press release pictureU.S. Army veteran Xiaobo Guan was struggling as a first-time business owner until capital and education from the Veteran Loan Fund helped him make improvements to his self-service car wash business.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Wells Fargo on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Wells FargoWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/wells-fargoEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Wells FargoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738381/Deploying-Capital-for-Veteran-Entrepreneurs]"

(PFE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-trending-stock-140002452.html,1675778402,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this drugmaker have returned -9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 8.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, indicating a change of -34.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -42%. This estimate has changed -28.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.92 indicates a change of +2.5% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $17.5 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -31.8%. The $68.97 billion and $69.57 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -31.3% and +0.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $24.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.36%. The EPS surprise was +10.68%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We can use results received already from Visa V as a small gauge. Let’s take a closer look.Visa Q1Visa reported better-than-expected results, posting EPS of $2.18 and handily beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 8.5%.Quarterly revenue totaled $7.9 billion, more than 3% above estimates and growing a solid 12% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOf course, a focus point of the release was the company’s Total Payments Volume (TPV). For the quarter, Total Payments Volume totaled roughly $3 billion, falling short of our consensus estimate by 5% but growing 1.4% year-over-year.It represented Visa’s third consecutive quarter falling short of our consensus estimate for Total Payments Volume, as seen in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPayPalTotal Payments Volume –Like Visa, PayPal’s Total Payments Volume will be closely monitored. For the quarter, our consensus estimate for Total Payments Volume stands firm at $359.2 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 6% year-over-year.PayPal has primarily fallen short of our consensus estimate for TPV, with four misses coming across its last six quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly Estimates – Analysts have had a favorable view regarding the quarter to be reported, with six upward earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last 60 days. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.20 suggests an 8% decline in earnings year-over-year.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPYPL’s top line is in better standing, with our $7.4 billion consensus revenue estimate suggesting an uptick of nearly 7% year-over-year.Quarterly Performance –PayPal has posted solid quarterly results as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates in back-to-back quarters.Just in its latest release, the company registered a 14% EPS beat and posted revenue modestly above expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation –Currently, PYPL shares trade at a 21.6X forward earnings multiple, a fraction of the steep 47.6X five-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company’s forward price-to-sales works out to be 3.2X, again well below the 6.9X five-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPayPal carries a Style Score of “B” for Value.Putting Everything TogetherEarnings season continues to chug along, with a surplus of companies reporting daily.This week, we’ll receive results from PayPal on Thursday, February 9th, after the market close. We already received results from a peer, Visa V, with the company posting a double-beat.Analysts have been optimistic for PYPL’s quarter, with estimates reflecting a pullback in earnings but an uptick in revenue year-over-year.In addition, the company’s Total Payments Volume will be monitored closely.Further, PYPL’s valuation multiples have pulled back, with the company’s forward price-to-sales and forward earnings multiple nowhere near their respective five-year medians.Heading into the print, PayPal PYPL is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP Score of 0.8%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Because of its setup, Zelle claims that its payments are not subject to a new IRS tax rule that was to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2022, Bloomberg reported. That rule was later deferred to apply to the 2023 tax year, instead, giving taxpayers time to prepare for its implementation.Under that rule, third-party payment processors such as Venmo and PayPal must issue 1099-K forms to any users who receive more than $600 in payments via their apps and also file them directly with the IRS.Prior to the rule, Venmo and other apps issued 1099-Ks only for customers with gross payments exceeding $20,000 who had made more than 200 of these transactions, Bloomberg noted. Because the thresholds are much smaller now, many small business owners and gig workers are flocking to Zelle on the theory that they won’t have to report income they receive on the platform.“A lot of people think they’re just doing a side gig, or are small potatoes, so why should they pay taxes?” Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told Bloomberg. “I think the level of noncompliance from small businesses is staggering.”He pointed to an IRS analysis of the years 2014-2016 estimating that unreported individual and small-business activities cost $144 billion in taxes a year. The report also found that Americans report less than half of the income that isn’t automatically reported for them.Take Our Poll: What’s the First Thing You Would Do if You Won a Big Lottery Jackpot?The IRS is very clear that anyone receiving business payments on a P2P platform such as PayPal, Venmo and Stripe is responsible for reporting that income, according to Intuit/TurboTax. The platforms themselves are also required to provide information to the IRS about customers who receive payments for the sale of goods and services through those platforms.Story continuesAnd as CNET noted, these platforms might reach out to you to confirm tax information such as your employer identification number, individual tax identification number or Social Security number.Things are fuzzier when it comes to Zelle, however, because it is integrated into users’ bank dashboards and run by Early Warning Services LLC, which is jointly owned by Bank of America, Truist, PNC, US Bancorp, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Capital One.As Bloomberg explained, Zelle is essentially an electronic network that manages automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions — and ACH networks “are not subject to 1099-K reporting,” according to Wendy Walker, chair of the Information Reporting Subgroup of the IRS Advisory Council.A Zelle spokeswoman had a similar take in an email to Bloomberg, saying that payments sent through its network “are not subject” to the new IRS law.Take Our Poll: How Much of a Tax Refund Do You Expect in 2023?More: Earn Passive Income With This Side Hustle That’s Perfect for IntrovertsRegardless of what the technical rules say, Rosenthal said people should be very wary of assuming they can dodge taxes by using Zelle instead of a P2P platform.“It’s a dangerous game for tax cheats to migrate to Zelle,” he told Bloomberg. “It wouldn’t be hard for the IRS to unravel that.”More From GOBankingRatesCostco's Best Deals?

(UDMY) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8%.Revenues are expected to be $165.81 million, up 20.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Udemy, Inc.For Udemy, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Udemy, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Udemy, Inc. Would post a loss of $0.18 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.15, delivering a surprise of +16.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Udemy, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Paypal (PYPL) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $7.39 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Paypal has been revised 1.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.84%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Paypal (PYPL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.21 a share two days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 9, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.21 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.20 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Paypal has an Earnings ESP of 0.84%.PYPL is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Alpha and Omega Semiconductor (AOSL).Alpha and Omega Semiconductor, which is readying to report earnings on May 4, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.11 a share, and AOSL is 86 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alpha and Omega Semiconductor is $0.84, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 32.14%.Story continuesPYPL and AOSL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend capture strategy and past performance of high dividend stocks, and go directly to read Dividend Capture Strategy: 5 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in February. Dividend capture strategy is one of the most popular techniques employed by short-term investors. The strategy involves buying dividend stocks before their ex-dividend dates and selling them after receiving the payouts. Investors often follow this technique because it offers the potential for price appreciation. If the stock price increases after the payout, the investor can sell the stock for a profit. Moreover, this strategy can be a source to generate stable income in a short time, especially if the dividends are above-average.Dividend stocks’ returns over the years have shown their solid performance during inflationary periods. According to a report by AMG Funds, dividend payments of the S&amp;P 500 Index have grown at an annual average rate of 6% over the past five decades, which is well above the inflation rate in the US. The report cited data from Ned Davis Research and mentioned that since 1979, dividend-payers outplayed non-dividend companies in periods where 10-year Treasury was rising.When following a dividend investment strategy, investors seek stocks with healthy yields in order to supplement their income. Moreover, these securities also have a potential for capital appreciation and can help investors diversify their portfolios. In 2021, high-yield dividend stocks in the US Total Cap outperformed non-dividend payers by 39.6%, as reported by IHS Markit. Similarly, high-dividend stocks performed better than non-dividend stocks in developed Europe during the same year. In addition to dividend yields, shareholders also evaluate these stocks in light of the respective company’s financial health, growth prospects, and future dividend policy. With decades-long dividend growth streaks under their belt, dividend growers become investors’ top choices when the market is uncertain. Some examples of such stocks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

You can skip our detailed analysis of the Central and South American economic outlook and go directly to the 5 Least Developed Countries in Latin America.Latin America comprises South and Central America. It is an economically maturing region with varying levels of development in different countries.Economic Problems in Latin America The region suffers from structural economic problems that have kept economic growth low in the region despite high potential. For instance, informality is a huge problem with economies in Central and South America. In fact, it's so pervasive that 60% of the workers in the region work in the informal economy, as noted by the World Economic Forum. Informal companies tend to remain small and less productive relative to their formal counterparts. This comes down to informal companies’ lack of access to formal credit markets and investment capital, and limited access to formal contract enforcement mechanisms among other factors. Other issues include limited diversification of the economies, inefficient provision of credit and reliance on commodity exports, as well as poor state of infrastructure. All in all, Latin American countries have been unable to tap their full potential and benefit from globalization as much as other regions like Asia have. Deglobalization and Emerging Opportunities Deglobalization is largely being driven by the ongoing decoupling between the US and the Chinese economy. It was further accelerated in the wake of the supply-chains collapse during the pandemic, with countries increasingly starting to prefer resilient supply chains even if it means more cost.In this regard, the US is increasingly moving its supply chains to Latin America, especially Mexico. Even before the pandemic, the US was in the process of shifting its supply chains from China as part of the trade war. The Chinese exports to the US dropped by 17% in 2019, as the US shifted some of its outsourcing to other countries, with Mexico gaining 16% from China’s lost share, bringing Mexico’s total share in the overall US imports to 15%, the highest after China. Story continuesAnother indicator that shows pre-pandemic pressures to shift outsourcing from China to Mexico is the labor cost. Wages in China superseded Mexican wages during 2014-2015, as noted by professor of International Affairs, Dr. Noel Maurer.Latin America offers other reinforcing advantages as well, as the US moves ahead with the Executive Order 14057 - an initiative to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2035 - which is set to exponentially increase the demand for electric vehicles. In this regard, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile - the ‘lithium triangle’- are sitting over half of the global lithium reserves, a critical ingredient for EV batteries. All these trends show a great outlook for Latin American economies in the coming years. However, problems with infrastructure and limited market reforms in these countries can prove to be challenging to overcome. A positive sign is that increasing number of US companies have been opening facilities in Latin American countries. Some of these include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Photo by Parker Hilton on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have defined the ‘least developed countries in Latin America’ as ones that have low human development and per-capita income, but a relatively big population size. For this purpose, we’ve excluded Latin American countries with population sizes below 1 million, as they’re insignificant from the standpoint of economic potential. For this list, we first picked Latin American countries with lowest values on the Human Development Index (HDI) as of 2021-22. We then picked Latin American countries with lowest GDPs per capita. We then assigned two rankings to each country; one based on their HDI and the other based on GDP per Capita in a descending order of low development. Finally, we ranked the countries on our list based on the averages of the two rankings.15. Dominican RepublicHDI Ranking: 22 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 13 Average Ranking: 17.5The Dominican Republic is located in the Caribbean. It is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, and there are several reasons for its impoverishment. These include high crime rate, low-quality education, unemployment, natural disasters, corruption and political instability.The Dominican Republic also suffers from environmental degradation, which has dented the country’s capacity in food production, with 15% of the country’s population in a serious food-insecurity crisis, since late 2022. The Dominican Republic has a GDP per Capita of $8,477 as of 202114. MexicoHDI Ranking: 19 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 15 Average Ranking: 17Mexico is located south of the United States. While it is certainly more developed than most of the other countries on the list, it still suffers from considerable underdevelopment, and has a GDP per Capita of $10,046 as of 2021.The factors contributing to this growth drag include the presence of cartels, corruption, income inequality, lack of access to quality education, as well as infrastructure that needs overhaul, given that the US is moving its supply chains closer to home. Mexico is ranked 53rd on the Logistics Performance Index. Other, deeper issues with the Mexican economy have had a hugely negative but silent effect. These comprise informality in the economy, poorly working credit markets and warped supply of non-traded inputs. However, Mexico has recently made reforms to address these problems in order to attract investment. Companies like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) have facilities operating in Mexico, with more and more companies moving in the country.13. PeruHDI Ranking: 20 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 11 Average Ranking: 15.5Peru is one of the least developed countries in Latin America, with a GDP per Capita of $6,622 as of 2021. Peru is plagued by many of the same problems as other underdeveloped Latin American economies. It is, in most part, reliant on commodity exports, with not enough diversification. Further, nearly half of its economy is informal, with estimates suggesting a figure of 42%, representing $279 billion of GDP in PPP terms. Other factors hindering development in Peru include lack of access to quality education, corruption, income inequality, poor healthcare, and lack of proper infrastructure, especially in rural areas. 12. BrazilHDI Ranking: 18 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 12 Average Ranking: 15Despite its huge GDP of $1.60 trillion, Brazil is one of the least developed countries in South America. There are a myriad of factors why this is the case. Brazil has a low productivity rate. Between 2003 and 2014, the country’s productivity per worker increased by only 21%, even as minimum and real wages grew by 68% and 38%, respectively, as shown by the World Bank.This discrepancy has been traced to excessive government regulation resulting in lack of private investment, as well as the tax system and problems with the infrastructure. The country has also seen a rise in unemployment, with the number rising from 7.6 million unemployed people in 2012, to 13.4 million in 2019. Other factors include Brazil’s struggle with fiscal discipline, land reforms and corruption. Despite Brazil’s situation, it has a huge economy and cheap labor costs in the country have been attracting companies like 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) among others.11. ColombiaHDI Ranking: 17 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 10 Average Ranking: 13.5Colombia has a GDP per Capita of $6,104 as of 2021, making it one of the least developed countries in the Americas. One of the biggest problems in the country is poverty, whose levels jumped to 42.5% in 2020 during the pandemic, as reported by Borgen Project.Colombia has also been mired in internal conflicts, and crime, with the country dominated by armed groups, resulting in it being one of the most dangerous countries in the world. It also suffers from a huge lack of infrastructure, with 81% of homes in Colombia’s rural areas having no access to piped water network. 10. EcuadorHDI Ranking: 15 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 9 Average Ranking: 12Ecuador is another country on the list with a huge informal economy, whose size is estimated to be 37.2% of its GDP. Apart from informality, many other problems contribute to Ecuador’s underdevelopment. The country’s economy is heavily regulated with virtually no fiscal discipline. Further, the economy is not diversified either, with Ecuador largely relying on revenue from oil export, which makes it vulnerable in the face of demand shocks. The country’s legacy of political instability does not help the situation either. 9. Venezuela HDI Ranking: 7 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 16 Average Ranking: 11.5Venezuela is located on the northern coast of South America. It is underdeveloped due to several political, economic and structural reasons. Venezuela’s economy is almost entirely dependent on oil, which comprises 98% of its exports and makes up 25% of the country’s GDP. This lack of economic diversification leaves the country vulnerable to fluctuations in the oil price and shaves off much of the potential growth that comes from a diversified economy. Other factors include extreme centralization of the economy and US sanctions. The combined effect of the two factors have excessively devalued the Venezuelan Bolivar, adding to the country’s problems. 8. ParaguayHDI Ranking: 12 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 8 Average Ranking: 10Paraguay is a landlocked country in South America. It has a GDP per Capita of $5,891.5 as of 2021. The country remains underdeveloped primarily because of its agrarian economy, that is based on internal consumption and exports to neighboring countries. 7. JamaicaHDI Ranking: 9 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 7 Average Ranking: 8Jamaica is another Caribbean country on the list. It has a GDP per Capita of $5,184 as of 2021. The country is underdeveloped due to several reasons. These include the legacy of military rule, corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies and economic mismanagement. By far, the biggest reason for Jamaica’s underdevelopment is that the economy largely relies on tourism, leaving little room for diversification.6. Bolivia HDI Ranking: 8 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 4 Average Ranking: 6Bolivia has a GDP per Capita of $3,345 as of 2021. It suffers from roughly the same issues as other Latin American countries that are underdeveloped. One exception is that the country is far worse off in infrastructure than most other Hispanic countries. It is ranked 136th out of 167 countries on the Logistics Performance Index. It is also worse off in child mortality, education and other development indicators.  Click to continue reading and see the 5 Least Developed Countries in Latin America.   Suggested Articles:25 Least Developed Countries in Europe25 Least Developed Countries in the World25 Most Developed Countries in the WorldDisclosure: none. 15 Least Developed Countries in Latin America is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Marathon Petroleum (MPC) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Marathon Petroleum currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.64, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.64 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MPCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MPCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Marathon Petroleum here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Marathon Petroleum, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MPC Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marathon Petroleum, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 11.5% over the past month to $17.36.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marathon Petroleum.

Among the automakers that revealed monthly sales numbers, Honda, Ford, Mazda, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru and Volvo registered year-over-year gains, while Toyota posted a decline in sales. Per Motor Intelligence, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales reached 16.21 million last month, marking the best level since May 2021. Per LMC Automotive, U.S. light vehicle sales totaled 1.04 million units in January, up 4.5% year over year. But lest we forget, January 2022 was the first January since 2012 that couldn’t record vehicle sales of even 1 million units amid severe supply chain issues. While sales in the last month rose year over year, it’s certainly not a sign that the auto industry is rebounding to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, January 2023 recorded the weakest vehicle sales since 2014 if we exclude January 2022 sales data.Meanwhile, a host of auto players released fourth-quarter results last week. U.S. legacy automaker General Motors GM beat earnings estimates, while its cross-town rival Ford F missed the same.  U.S. motorcycle giant Harley-Davidson HOG, auto retailer Asbury Automotive ABG and automotive equipment provider Lear Corporation LEA surpassed fourth-quarter earnings estimates.GM, F, HOG, ABG and LEA carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company recorded adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $3,799 million, higher than $2,839 million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesGeneral Motors had cash and cash equivalents of $19,153 million as of Dec 31, 2022, compared with $20,067 million as of Dec 31, 2021.

(General Motors Q4 Earnings Beat on GMNA Unit Strength)Ford reported adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents. Lower-than-expected profits from all but International Markets Group unit led to this downslide. The bottom line improved 96.2% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 26 cents.

Revenues from Ford Automotive segment increased 18% to $41.8 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.4 billion.Ford reported an adjusted FCF of $2.4 billion during the quarter.

Higher-than-anticipated revenues from the Motorcycles &amp; Related Products and Financial Services segments resulted in this outperformance.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the returns of dividend growers, and go directly to read 5 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future. Dividend Kings are companies that have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. Due to consistent interest rates hike and growing inflation, investors are steadily loading up on dividend securities to ensure regular income. Moreover, these stocks also offer potential for capital appreciation as the stock price increases over time. When considering dividend stocks, investors focus on companies that hold extended track records of dividend growth. West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some companies that have been rewarding investors with growing dividends for decades.Dividend-growing stocks perform well during inflation as increased income can protect investors’ purchasing power. Various reports revealed that dividend growers exhibited strong performance during previous inflationary periods. The S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation since 2000, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report cited S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Bureau of Economic Analysis data and mentioned that dividends now represent 7.3% of personal income, up from 3.2% in 1980. Another report by ClearBridge Investments showed that dividend growers delivered an annual average return of 11.1% in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 to Q3 2022, versus a 9.2% return of the broader market. Similarly, in 12 months before the Fed rate hike during the same period, dividend growers returned 21.4%, compared with a 15.7% return of the S&amp;P 500.Another important factor worth considering is the payout ratios of dividend companies. This is important to measure the proportion of the company’s earnings that is paid out as dividends to shareholders. Moreover, it also shows the financial health of the company and the stability of its future dividends. Generally, companies with payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have sufficient cash flow generation to fulfill shareholder obligations.Story continuesIn view of this, we will discuss companies that are likely to be dividend kings in the future.10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the FutureOur Methodology:For this article, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for 29 years or more. From that list, we selected companies that have a 5-year average dividend payout ratio of less than 50%, which shows the stability of their future dividends. This also indicates that these companies allocate a healthy portion of their earnings in dividend payouts. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.10.

In January, BMO Capital initiated its coverage on the stock with a Market Perform rating and a $225 price target. The firm expects the company's margins to improve this year.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) reported net premiums of $10.55 billion, which showed a 13.2% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow came in at $2.65 billion. It returned $345 million to shareholders in dividends during the quarter.Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.57%, as of February 7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”9. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this airline have returned +17.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.6% change. The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, to which United belongs, has gained 8.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share, indicating a change of +116.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +344.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.27 points to a change of +228.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +24.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.47 indicates a change of +14.5% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for United.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of United, the consensus sales estimate of $11.41 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +50.8%. The $52.46 billion and $54.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.7% and +4.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $12.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.4%. EPS of $2.46 for the same period compares with -$1.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.39%. The EPS surprise was +18.84%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The airline industry is one of the most complicated industries to predict on Wall Street. Like most industries, airlines have inputs and outputs, the sum of which ultimately leads to profitability or large losses. Over the past few years, airlines have had to contend with the following:·      A Global Pandemic: Shrank demand to nearly zero and decreased the number of employees.·      Complex Geopolitical Circumstances:The War in Ukraine drove crude oil prices to near triple digits before pulling back last year.·      Lack of Skilled Employees:Many pilots in the industry aged, some quit, and others were laid off during the pandemic.·      Outdated Airplanes:Supply chain issues and delays due to safety concerns from aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing (BA) led to a lack of airplanes.Despite the many challenges mentioned above, the airline industry is showing signs of life. The U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS is used by investors as a proxy for the industry:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchClear Skies Ahead?Below I will lay out 5 reasons why the tough times experienced by airlines in recent years may finally be over:1.   A Return to Profitability: International airlines survived massive losses during the pandemic and are now back to earning healthy profits. For example, United Airlines UAL lost $28 per share in 2020. In 2022, UAL made $2.50 per share.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPanamanian airlineCopa Holdings CPA and other international airlines show a similar EPS trajectory:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research2.   Rising EPS Estimates: Airline providers such as American Airlines AAL, Ryanair RYAAY, and United Airlines have rising consensus estimates moving forward. AAL and UAL also have positive Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) scores suggesting that they are likely to surprise earnings to the upside the next time they report. Delta DAL is one of the few airline stocks with a negative ESP score. That said, Delta is coming off a blockbuster quarter where EPS rocketed 573%.Story continues3.   Oil Showing Signs of Lagging:The longer oil prices lag, the larger the headwind for the airline industry. Crude oil and oil-related stocks are beginning to exhibit relative weakness. For instance, over the past month, the S&amp;P 500 Index is +9.40% while Exxon Mobil XOM is slightly lower.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research4.   Recovery to Pre-pandemic Levels: Recently, Boeing Ceo Dave Calhoun confirmed his aspirations to return to pre-pandemic aircraft production levels. Airline giants like United are planning to hire thousands of pilots in 2023 to increase staff – with no training capacity constraints. Meanwhile, air travel occupancy levels have recovered fully.5.   Drastically Improving Technical Picture:  Uptrend Resumed: After five failed attempts to re-take the 200-day moving average in the past two years, the JETS ETF decisively broke above the line in 2023 – signaling a distinct change in character.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPost Earnings Drift Potential / Bull Flags: Because markets are inefficient, stocks tend to trend after reporting stellar earnings like most airlines just did. Stocks like UAL rocketed higher in early 2023 and have been consolidating and digesting gains in a bullish manner since.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Target Target Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Harrison, for US$453k worth of shares, at about US$218 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$175). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Target insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Target Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Target insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$175m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Target Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Target insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Target (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.Story continuesOf course Target may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

242,c71559c0-d993-388d-bee4-411571d64bf4,TGT,2023-02-08,4 Retail Discount Stocks That Warrant Attention Despite Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-retail-discount-stocks-warrant-141502778.html,1675779302,STORY,"['BURL', 'COST', 'TGT', 'TJX', '^GSPC']","[Ongoing inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering lately. Also, rising prices are squeezing consumers’ disposable income, depleting personal savings and dampening demand. With the desperate need to tame inflation, the Federal Reserve is raising the benchmark interest rate. But a higher interest rate environment is not good news for consumer-centric industries.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Burlington Stores, Inc. BURL.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys and seasonal décor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Story continuesConsumer Confidence Slackens: Escalating prices and rising interest rates continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity and confidence. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 107.1 in January from December’s upwardly revised reading of 109.0. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. But rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The consumer price index rose to 6.5% in December 2022 on a year-over-year basis, albeit at a slower rate when compared with November.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in the low-to-middle income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products as well as enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. They are trying to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in the renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

Royal Caribbean. The stock surging today on a bullish forecast and bookings that significantly exceeded pre-pandemic levels. The cruise line reported Q4 earnings today topping EPS expectations by $0.22, although narrowly missing revenue estimates with $2.6 billion. That's a 164% increase, though, from the prior year.Their CEO, Jason Liberty, bullish, saying, quote, ""We are experiencing a recordbreaking wave season."" What's a wave season? That's the time-- right now, generally speaking-- where prices are lowest, often the first quarter. Liberty also adding, ""Leisure travel strength continues as consumers spend is shifting towards experiences, with cruises maintaining an attractive value proposition."" You can see shares popping big time, up 7%.Carnival and Norwegian also up on this news, trending tickers all of them. We heard some great news from an analyst that covers all these stocks saying this is a strong year. Demand is back.- Yeah, James Hardiman from Citi joining us last week, talking about the investment opportunity that he sees not only in Royal Caribbean, but really across the board in the space right now from the big three cruise lines here in the US. You're looking at gains year to date-- so just in the past, what, five, six weeks or so-- of almost 50%. And we asked him, we said, is a lot of this good news already priced into the stock? And he actually said that no, he thinks it has further room to the upside. That's clearly proven by the announcement today, by the move in the stock.My question though, is when I talk to people, there's a lot of hesitancy when it comes to booking cruises. People aren't necessarily jumping back into it--- Are you talking COVID hesitancy?- COVID hesitancy.- Yes.- And I think also people just changed some of their behavior. Maybe people who were taking cruises before aren't necessarily jumping back in right away. These numbers seem to be proving it wrong. I'm just saying, in terms of who I'm talking to--Story continues- It's the bowling hangover, man. People don't want to bowl anymore because they don't want to stick their fingers in a dirty ball.- No. But that's a little bit different than being trapped on a cruise.- People were trapped on these ships for weeks. I am shocked by this. I mean, it was a huge story. I get the value play. It's unlimited ice cream. Who doesn't like that? But they were literally trapped. I have friends that, like, would never, ever go on a cruise ever again. So this--- Maybe we aren't the right demographic, because a lot of times--- Yeah.- Check the websites, man. They are all on sale. It is an unbeatable deal.]"

Stephanie Klepacki / UnsplashRoyal Caribbean Group heads into 2023 with booking demand stronger than it was in 2019, a fully operational fleet, and a passenger market ready to splurge on onboard experiences.For the fourth quarter, total revenues per passenger cruise day were up 3.5 percent from 2019 for the same period. Revenue totaled $2.6 billion, which was higher than expectations, said Royal Caribbean Group President and CEO Jason Liberty on a quarterly earnings call on Tuesday. Still, the cruise line’s  net loss stood at $500.2 million.In the fourth quarter, 60 percent of the cruise company’s guests booked some of their onboard activities in advance of their cruise. Executives expect this behavior to continue into 2023.  “So far, guests booked on 2023 sailings purchased onboard experience an average of more than two months earlier than in 2019,” said Liberty.Executives said a big boost came from consumers sitting on a lot of savings and their growing interest in experiences.The biggest driver has been due to the technology investments that have facilitated consumer booking before and on the cruise.“Our ability to get the consumer to book earlier is really the main force behind why we’re seeing an increase in onboard activity,” Liberty said. “Allowing them to plan what they want to do on the ship as well as shore excursions is certainly creating a great tailwind for us.”Bookings outpaced 2019 and exceeded expectations, said Liberty. The seven biggest booking weeks in Royal Caribbean’s history occurred since the middle of November 2022. Booking windows are now “within a couple of weeks what’s normally been,” according to Liberty. Bookings heading into 2023 are stronger than they were in 2019 even though prices are higher.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to $409 million. Load factor in the fourth quarter amounted to 95 percent, with Caribbean sailings reaching 100 percent, and holiday sailings close to 110 percent.Story continuesThe full 2022 year was a return to normalcy for Royal Caribbean after a rough pandemic period. “2022 was a pivotal year as we successfully returned our business to full operations and delivered memorable vacation experiences to 6 million guests,” said Liberty.For 2022, revenue totaled $8.8 billion. Revenue per passenger cruise day was up 4 percent from 2019. Onboard spend per passenger rose 30 percent from 2019. The company’s full fleet has been back in operation since June 2022 and load factor was 85 percent.Royal Caribbean expects to increase its load factor by 14 percent compared to 2019 with eight new ships already introduced since 2019 and three more set to be delivered this year, said Liberty.Even though China has opened up to travel, Royal Caribbean doesn’t expect that market to be back until 2024. There remains a ban on cruising and group travel in China and Japan’s covid protocols on Chinese tourists, which including testing and potential quarantines, are the main impediments, said Liberty. Executives expect these two obstacles to drop within the first half of 2023 and deliver a strong profitability boost in 2024.Where the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war impacts Royal Caribbean is the unavailability of many parts of the Baltic region for ship deployment and higher energy prices for its European market, according to Royal Caribbean executives.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"
253,7aa3dbb4-7fa3-32a4-874f-4ba9203e22c5,ADI,2023-02-08,Cloudflare (NET) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloudflare-net-report-q4-earnings-120712747.html,1675771632,STORY,"['NET', 'ADI', 'CSCO']","[Cloudflare NET is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 9.The company projects fourth-quarter revenues in the band of $273.5-$274.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is currently pegged at $274.3 million, indicating an improvement of 41.7% year over year.Cloudflare expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 4 cents and 5 cents. The consensus mark for the same stands at 4 cents per share, implying a robust improvement from the year-ago quarter’s breakeven earnings.The web infrastructure and website security solution provider projects non-GAAP income from operations between $12 million and $13 million. Cloudflare’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 100%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement.Cloudflare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCloudflare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCloudflare, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cloudflare, Inc. QuoteFactors to Note Ahead of Q4 EarningsCloudflare’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the solid demand for security solutions, which became imperative due to aggravated cyberattacks, work-and-learn-from-home policies and a zero-trust approach.The to-be-reported quarter’s top line is likely to have witnessed the impact of the accelerated global footprint expansion outside the United States. It is worth mentioning that the United States, the EMEA and the APAC represented 53%, 27% and 13% of the total revenues, respectively, in the third quarter.Moreover, a diversified customer base is likely to have contributed to NET’s fourth-quarter top line. It added around 4,197 new paying customers in the last reported quarter, bringing the total count to approximately 156,000 across more than 170 countries.Cloudflare added 159 new large customers (annual billings of more than $100,000), taking the total count to 1,908 at the end of the third quarter, up from the 1,749 recorded at the end of the second quarter of 2022. This uptrend, which has prevailed for the past few quarters, is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by the elevated demand for its cloud-based solutions amid the ongoing remote-working trend.Story continuesThe company's recurring subscription-based business model has been providing relative stability to its top line amid post-pandemic disruptions. It expects variability in cash flow margins due to working capital fluctuations, large enterprise business growth and seasonal factors.However, Cloudflare’s significant exposure to small and medium businesses, the worst-hit cohorts by the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, is likely to have weighed on its performance in the quarter to be reported.What Our Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NET this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Though Cloudflare currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.13% at present. ADI’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.8%.

The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 13. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, the average surprise being 3.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Check Point’s fourth-quarter earnings stands at $2.35 per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 4.4%.

Price and EPS SurpriseQualys, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseQualys, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Qualys, Inc. QuoteFactors to Note Ahead of Q4 EarningsQualys offers cloud security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their information technology infrastructures. This helps protect their IT systems and applications from cyberattacks.The company’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the surging demand for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. Accelerated digital transformations by organizations are also expected to have fueled the demand for QLYS’ cloud-based security solutions.Qualys’ sustained focus on broadening its product portfolio and capabilities through acquisitions is anticipated to have aided its overall performance in the fourth quarter. The buyout of artificial intelligence/machine learning assets from Blue Hexagon in October 2022 transformed Qualys Cloud Platform’s massive data lake into a powerful predictive analytics engine to perform real-time zero-day threat detection.The abovementioned acquisition provided the company with a solid competitive differentiation in the IT security market. This is likely to have helped Qualys win new deals in the fourth quarter.Story continuesQualys' recurring subscription-based business model has been providing relative stability to its top line amid post-pandemic disruptions. The company expects to drive durable top-line growth and leverage its highly scalable model to maintain strong cash flow and industry-leading profitability.However, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.

Highways have been blockaded throughout the copper-rich south, threatening production and transport of the metal, hitting some company shares, and boosting already high prices.But the data suggests mining activity has been resilient, at least for now.This includes massive deposit Las Bambas, owned by China's MMG Ltd, which previously said it would have to halt production from Feb. 1, and Glencore's Antapaccay, which stopped production in mid-January but has since resumed.The power data from COES, which represents firms in Peru's energy sector, shows that nearly all major mines are drawing normal or near-normal levels of electricity. The data has traditionally been a reliable indicator of mining activity.GRAPHIC: Peru Mines: Power use (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/zjpqjwqokvx/chart.png)A source close to Las Bambas said the mine, which previously said it faced a production halt from Feb. 1 due to key provisions not reaching the mine, said it had been able to keep operating at a minimum level after getting ""last minute supplies.""The mine, which normally supplies some 2% of global copper, has been hit by regular blockades for years, usually causing its power use to fall sharply during the periods of disruption. This has not yet happened this time around, despite the protests.Story continuesThe person added, however, that the mine risked fully running out of supplies by Wednesday, which would force it to move into a ""care and maintenance"" mode with its machinery that would use half the normal level of power.GRAPHIC: Las Bambas: Power and protest 9https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/gdvzynngzpw/chart.png)The data shows some mines experienced temporary dips in power use in recent months, including Peru's largest mine Antamina, co-owned by Glencore and BHP, and Glencore's Antapaccay around the middle of January.Antapaccay reopened on Jan. 31 after a temporary halt and has been operating again at full capacity.Hudbay Mineral Inc's Constancia mine has seen power use start to decline recently. Others, like Freeport-McMoRan's Cerro Verde are at normal or elevated levels. A combined index of six key mines is near normal.Freeport-McMoRan spokesperson Linda Hayes said: ""We are continuing to operate, but have limited our mill throughput by about 10% to deal with intermittent supply disruptions.""The other firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment about activity at their mines in Peru.The mining activity is key to keeping global copper supply flowing. Brokerage Jefferies said in a Jan. 31 note that some 30% of Peruvian copper supply was at risk from the unrest, a ""potential positive for the copper price.""The protests - which have led to the deaths of 48 people and are the worst violence Peru has seen in over 20 years - could of course soon start to have a greater effect on mining operations. Demonstrators are becoming more determined as lawmakers struggle to agree on calling snap elections, a key protest demand.This week, Peru's Buenaventura suspended operations at a key silver mine after protesters invaded the site.At a blockade on the ""mining corridor"" highway, protester Wilber Toco Aragua Salcedo told Reuters that people felt like the mines took all the wealth and left little for locals.""The south is quite rich, but the mining concessions that we have harm the people,"" he said, adding he had heard mines were stocking up on supplies. ""The people do not get tired, the people won't go away, we will not take a step back.""GRAPHIC: Peru: mines and power 9https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/byvrlkoxave/chart.png)(Reporting by Alex Villegas in Espinar and Adam Jourdan in Buenos Aires; Additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder, Melanie Burton, Valentine Hilaire and Fabian Cambero; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Bernadette Baum)]"

This solution includes full support for coach-to-coach communications on the field and provides the NFL with speed, security and reliability for critical on field coach-to-coach communication. Verizon will showcase this solution in a 30-second commercial spot “Next Season Starts Now,” slated to air immediately following the Super Bowl LVII broadcast on Feb. 12.“In an NFL game, every moment matters – seconds matter – as the margin between winning and losing is miniscule. The backbone of world-class play on-the-field is communication,” said Sowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO, Verizon Business. “The NFL understands and leans into the power of innovation and technology and this Managed Private Wireless solution deployment is a testament to how the NFL uses the latest technology for the game.”This Managed Private Wireless solution was successfully piloted during all five international NFL games this season spanning across the UK, Germany and Mexico. This included deployment and management of the private wireless technology, testing and coordination and in-game operational support.This solution is part of the broader Verizon Business Connected Venue approach, which is rooted in its 5G investment in more than 75 large public venues in the United States, including some of the most iconic major sports and music venues. Verizon brings a mix of public and private network capabilities, a robust technology ecosystem, and 5G partnerships that enable leagues, teams, and stadium operators to create and deliver a first-class fan experience and achieve desired venue operations outcomes.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Verizon Communications is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.092 = US$30b ÷ (US$380b - US$50b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.2%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 7.8% average generated by the Telecom industry. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceIn the above chart we have measured Verizon Communications' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verizon Communications here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Verizon Communications doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 13% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom LineIn summary, Verizon Communications is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And with the stock having returned a mere 3.3% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.Story continuesVerizon Communications does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Verizon Communications  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The Verizon colors first adorned the No. 12 Team Penske Chevrolet in 2009 during Power’s initial, part-time NICS season. The technology, communications, information and entertainment leader has remained the primary sponsor of Power throughout his 15-year career with Team Penske, with this new agreement extending the relationship into the future.“Verizon has been a true partner of Team Penske since our first season together in 2009,” said team owner Roger Penske. “They have been an integral part of our success in INDYCAR competition. Verizon is a terrific fit for our INDYCAR team and the INDYCAR SERIES as one the world’s technological leaders. Their cutting-edge approach means a bright future for our partnership.”Power continues to rise through the ranks of the all-time greatest drivers in the NTT INDYCAR SERIES as he enters his 15th season as part of the Team Penske lineup. After winning races at a prodigious clip early in his career, the Toowoomba, Australia native captured his first series title in 2014. In 2018, he became the first Australian to win “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” with a spectacular drive in the No. 12 Verizon Chevrolet. However, the 2022 season was one in which he fully-cemented his place in INDYCAR SERIES lore. A consistent season was transformed into a historic one as he passed Mario Andretti for the most pole positions in series history in the season-finale weekend at Laguna Seca. A third-place finish in that race lifted Power to his second career title in a season in which he completed all 2,268 laps of competition. Throughout the partnership between Verizon and Penske, Power has raced to 41 wins and 68 pole positions, ranking fifth and second in team history, respectively.Story continues“Very few drivers are lucky enough to have the support of one partner for as long as I’ve had the opportunity to work with Verizon,” said Power. “They have been instrumental in my career, a career that would likely have looked much different without them. I still have things I want to accomplish and I look forward to representing them and having my number 12 car with the Verizon logo in the winner’s circle.”Verizon and Team Penske have a longstanding innovation history. From using Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband to analyze the performance of cars coming in and out of the first turn at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in preparation for the Indy 500 and being able to analyze performance data in near real-time, to race fans being able to share, stream and tweet race moments via Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband at the Penske-owned Indianapolis Motor Speedway, innovation is at the forefront of this partnership.“Team Penske has been a true co-innovation partner since the very beginning of our relationship. They understand the impact that Verizon 5G can have on what they are trying to achieve each season, which is a NTT INDYCAR SERIES title, and the proof is in their performance,” said Massimo Peselli, CRO of Global Enterprise and Public Sector, Verizon Business. “We’re excited to continue this legacy and be a key part of this storied race team’s future.”Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services.

Cars owned and prepared by Team Penske have produced more than 600 major race wins, over 670 pole positions and 43 championships across open-wheel, stock car and sports car racing competition. Over the course of its 56-year history, the team has also earned 18 Indianapolis 500 victories, three Daytona 500 Championships, a Formula 1 win, victories in the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring, along with a win in Australia’s legendary Bathurst 1000 race.

Dismal overall top-line and bottom-line performances, along with a decline in both segments’ reported revenues during the period, are disappointing.

Gross margin contracted 157 basis points to 78.9%.Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 43.9% to $13.2 million. Research and development expenses went up 9.3% year over year to $12.7 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $25.9 million rose 24.6% year over year.Adjusted operating loss totaled $6.3 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million.Financial PositionSurmodics exited first-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $26.4 million compared with $18.9 million at the end of fiscal 2022. The company ended first-quarter fiscal 2023 with total debt of $29.5 million compared with $10 million at the end of fiscal 2022.Net cash used in operating activities at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023 was $10.8 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $7 million a year ago.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceSurmodics has revised its full-year financial outlook.The company now projects fiscal year revenues to be within the range of $102 million-$106 million, representing an increase of 2-6% over the comparable prior-year period. This is lower than the previous outlook of $103 million-$107 million, reflecting an uptick of 3-7% over the comparable prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $105.3 million.Adjusted diluted loss per share for fiscal 2023 is now expected within the range of $2.09-$1.69 compared with the prior outlook of adjusted diluted loss per share of $2.54-$2.14. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at a loss of $2.35 per share.Our TakeSurmodics exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The company registered robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and royalties and license fees. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand. This looks promising for the stock.In October 2022, Surmodics announced its entry into a new, five-year credit agreement with MidCap Financial, which is encouraging. Announcements like the favorable 24-month data from its TRANSCEND clinical trial of the SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB) and positive 12-month data from its SWING first-in-human study of Sundance Sirolimus DCB raise our optimism about the stock.However, the company’s dismal year-over-year bottom-line results in the fiscal first quarter are concerning. Lower revenues from the IVD segment and a decline in research, development and other revenues are discouraging. The gross margin contraction also does not bode well for the stock. Surmodics continued to incur operating losses in the reported quarter, which further raised our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSurmodics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc. HOLX.Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.32, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.8%.

274,bbfe8ec2-0ef8-3735-9c4b-138b10f967be,MCK,2023-02-08,Should Value Investors Buy AmerisourceBergen (ABC) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-buy-amerisourcebergen-abc-144002800.html,1675780802,STORY,"['ABC', 'MCK']","[Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is AmerisourceBergen (ABC). ABC is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 13.16, while its industry has an average P/E of 18.43. Over the past year, ABC's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.90 and as low as 11.77, with a median of 13.20.Investors should also note that ABC holds a PEG ratio of 1.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ABC's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.63. ABC's PEG has been as high as 1.82 and as low as 1.43, with a median of 1.59, all within the past year.Finally, our model also underscores that ABC has a P/CF ratio of 12.86. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 24.76. Within the past 12 months, ABC's P/CF has been as high as 14.86 and as low as 10.91, with a median of 13.35.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Medical - Dental Supplies value stock, take a look at McKesson (MCK). MCK is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of McKesson are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.77 and a PEG ratio of 1.33 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 18.43 and 1.63, respectively.Over the last 12 months, MCK's P/E has been as high as 15.66, as low as 11.65, with a median of 14.02, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.56, as low as 0.99, with a median of 1.43.Furthermore, McKesson holds a P/B ratio of -23.77 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 6.50. MCK's P/B has been as high as -23.77, as low as -59.10, with a median of -34.64 over the past 12 months.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that AmerisourceBergen and McKesson are likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, ABC and MCK feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

275,8652f0b8-0169-37ab-a6fa-a41ad50dcff7,MCK,2023-02-08,Here's Why McKesson (MCK) is Poised for a Turnaround After Losing -6.24% in 4 Weeks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-mckesson-mck-poised-143502167.html,1675780502,STORY,['MCK'],"[McKesson (MCK) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 6.2% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why MCK Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 27.85 for MCK is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for MCKThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for MCK has increased 4.7%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, MCK currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the full year performance. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that, some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.Story continuesJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of 2022, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. Last year was an incredibly exciting one for Cummins and our stakeholders. We made significant strides in our inorganic growth strategy, most notably through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. We also navigated complex global supply chain challenges, advanced our preparation for the separation of our filtration business and transition from Tom to me as the CEO.We accomplished all of this and delivered record revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share in 2022. We did so with the focus on the exciting opportunity in front of us to lead the industry to a broader clean economy and do so in a way that is best for our stakeholders and the planet. Decarbonization is a growth opportunity for Cummins, uniting our business and climate goals. In 2022, we launched our long-term decarbonization growth strategy, Destination Zero, which includes making meaningful reductions in carbon emissions through advanced internal combustion technologies widely accepted by the market today, while continuing to invest in and advance zero emissions technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. As part of our organic growth strategy, we unveiled the industry's first unified fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain platforms, and we continue to see momentum in our electrolyzer technology and green hydrogen production opportunities.Demand for our products remains strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $7.8 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand in many of our North America markets. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance, I'm excluding the Meritor operating results and associated acquisition and integration costs, the costs related to the separation of the filtration business and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia.Mark will provide more detail on the reported results in his comments. With these exclusions considered, EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% of sales in Q4, above our guidance of 15.5% and stronger than the $705 million or 12.1% reported a year ago. EBITDA and percentage improved due to an increase in gross margins with positive pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage costs and some improvement in logistics costs, all of which offset increases in material costs. Gross margin improvement is key to meeting our long-term goals of increasing the returns in our core business while transitioning our New Power business to break even EBITDA by 2027. In the fourth quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement, and we continue to accelerate value capture opportunities across the business.Our employees have done an excellent job in integrating the Meritor operations and people within Cummins and continue to make strides in identifying cost reduction opportunities. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $130 million in pretax synergies we referenced upon completion of the acquisition. And in addition, we expect to deliver incremental tax synergies as we integrate the business. Excluding Meritor, 2022 revenues were a record $26.2 billion, 9% higher than 2021. Also excluding Meritor, the costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and the impact of the indefinite suspension of our Russia operations, full year EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% of sales compared to $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales in 2021.Improved volumes, better price realization and an improved supply chain environment more than offset higher compensation expenses, increased material costs and lower joint venture income for the year. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in Engine, Power Systems, Distribution and Components segments. Leading the way was the Components segment, which delivered 150 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. The Power Systems business finished 2022 with another solid quarter and delivered full year EBITDA of 12.2%, up from 11.2% last year. The improvement in performance in this segment over the past six months is encouraging, and you will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. EBITDA margins in the distribution business increased by 110 basis points.Our reported full year 2022 results include five months of operational performance for Meritor or $1.9 billion of revenue and $26 million of EBITDA, including $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2023 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2023 guidance includes our expected results of the Meritor business and excludes the costs or benefits associated with the separation of the filtration business. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2023 to increase 12% to 17%, compared to 2022 and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales, driven by the inclusion of a full year of sales from Meritor, continued strength in the North American truck market, improved demand in power generation markets, overall pricing improvement and slow improvement in the China on-highway markets.Industry's production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2023, a range of a 5% decline to 2% improvement year-over-year. In medium-duty truck, we expect the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. We expect our deliveries in North America to continue to outpace the market, as the engine partnerships we announced in 2021 continue to phase in. Our Engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 7% in 2023. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy and medium duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in demand in the light duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022.Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 25% to 35% in 2023 as the market adjusts to new emissions regulations and digests inventory on hand. We are watching the situation in China closely, with ensuring the safety and well-being of our people as our first priority. The change in the country's COVID lockdown policy could positively impact our operations in the coming months. The current events make it difficult to gauge. The markets within China are at a low point, as we close out 2022 and our guidance assumes a slow recovery in 2023. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to be up 1% in 2023. We expect the industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023.Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, dependent upon the trajectory of commodity prices and supply chain improvement. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, primarily driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvements in the data center market. In New Power, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, more than doubling our 2022 revenues. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to convert to backlog and to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, we shared that we had reached the milestone of a $100 million in electrolyzer backlog.15 fastest growing industries in the worldChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comThis tripled to $300 million at the end of 2022, demonstrating the strong momentum in this market. With demand continuing to rise, we are focused on adding capacity for electrolyzer production. During 2022 we announced several capacity expansion investments and expect to have more than two gigawatts of scalable capacity in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe across Europe, North America and China. Additionally, we will continue to deliver battery, electric and fuel cell systems along with electric powertrain technologies as adoption continues in the transportation markets. As mentioned, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. We are continuing to drive improvement in our margins post-acquisition and expect Meritor to be accretive to earnings per share in 2023.We will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. Within Components, we expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue in 2023 with EBITDA margins in the range of 10.3% to 11%, an improvement from the comparable 2022 EBITDA margin of 7.2%. The electric powertrain portion of the Meritor business has been integrated within the New Power portfolio with projected 2023 EBITDA losses of $55 million included in the overall guidance for that segment. In 2023 we anticipate that demand will remain strong in most of our key regions and markets, especially in the first half of the year. While some macroeconomic indicators have weakened in recent months, we have not seen a significant change in customer orders at this time.In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 12% to 17% and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales. We have taken a number of actions to improve our EBITDA in 2023 and expect to generate very strong incremental margins within our core business and improve the margins of the Meritor business while continuing to invest in our New Power business. Having effectively managed through the challenges of the past couple years we expect improved performance in 2023 and are well positioned to invest in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. There are four key takeaways from my comments today. First, we delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding our own projections for revenue and EBITDA from three months ago, and we delivered stronger margins Engines, Components, Distribution and Power Systems compared to a year ago. Second, we continue to make good progress on the integration of Meritor and we remain on-track to deliver $130 million of pretax synergies by the end of year three. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, demand for our products remains strong, supporting increased revenues in our core business and New Power and growth in EBITDA and earnings per share in 2023.Now, let me go into more details on the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $7.8 billion and EBITDA of $1.1 billion or 14.2%. For the full year, revenues were $28.1 billion and EBITDA of $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales. Also in the fourth quarter, Meritor generated $1.2 billion of revenue, $60 million of EBITDA, after incurring $27 million of acquisition and integration related costs. Our fourth quarter results also included $19 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Full year 2022 results included five months of operational performance for Meritor, yielding $1.9 billion of revenue, $26 million of EBITDA, reflecting $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs.We will all look forward to a cleaner set of numbers in 2023. Our full year 2022 results also included $81 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance. I am excluding the Meritor results and the separation of filtration and the indefinite suspension of Russia in my following comments. But hopefully, you are clear after my earlier remarks about the magnitude of those -- each of those items. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 25%, driven by continued strong demand in truck markets.International revenues decreased 1% with stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment in most markets, offset by declines in China and, of course, the impact of our suspension of our operations in Russia. Currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% due to a stronger U.S. dollar. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% compared to $705 million or 12.1% a year ago. EBITDA increased by $359 million due mainly to improved pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage expenses, all of which contributed to stronger gross margin performance and more than offset higher material costs. Now, let's go into our income statement, a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 26.3% of sales increased by $420 million or 380 basis points from a year ago.Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $52 million or 6% due to higher compensation and research costs as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly in the Engines and New Power segments. Joint venture income decreased $28 million due to lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $44 million, an increase of $13 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher pension income. Interest expense increased $58 million, largely driven by the financing costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.2%, including $52 million or $0.36 per diluted share -- favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $631 million or $4.43 per diluted share, up from $394 million or $2.73 a year ago.Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $817 million, including Meritor and, $85 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by higher earnings. For the full year 22, revenues were a record $26.2 billion or up 9% from a year ago, with sales in North America up 18% and international revenues down 2%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues for the full year by 2%. EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% for 2022 compared to $3.5 billion of 14.7% of sales a year ago. Improvements in Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Engine margins were partially offset by increased investment in New Power and more than $100 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin some of our nonqualified benefit plans.All of that run through our operating EBITDA. All-in net earnings were $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share compared to $2.1 billion or $14.61 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion, primarily due to higher inventory levels. Capital expenditures in 2022 were $916 million, an increase of $182 million from 2021 as we continue to invest in new products and capacity expansion critical for future growth. We returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders or 63% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends last year. Now, moving on to our guidance for 2023, which includes Meritor, and thankfully, reduces the number of exclusions we'll have to explain each quarter, and I appreciate your patience as we work through that in 2022.We are excluding any separation costs associated with filtration, and for now, we're assuming that the operating results of filtration are in our guidance for the full year 2023, as the timing of that separation is not yet determined. We expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion of revenue in 2023. We currently project 2023 company revenues, including Meritor, to be up 12% to 17% and company-wide EBITDA margins expected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.2%. In 23, we expect revenues for the Engine business will be flat to up 5%, driven by continued strength in North American truck market and a modest recovery in China. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% compared to 14.4% in 2022. We expect distribution revenues this year to be up 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% compared to 10.5% in 2022.Including Meritor, we expect 2023 components revenues to increase 28% to 33% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8% compared to 15.0% in 2022. In 23, we also expect Power Systems revenues to be up 5% to 10% due to higher demand for oil and gas engines and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA there is projected to be between 13% and 13.7%, up from 12.2% of sales last year. And also this year, we expect New Power revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million. We expect New Power net losses to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million as we continue to make targeted investments in capacity, technology to support growing customer demand. Our goal remains to achieve breakeven EBITDA in 2027. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 22%, excluding any discrete items.Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time and have accelerated cash returns to shareholders in recent years above that 50% goal when we have generated more cash than required to support our strategy. In 2023, we will prioritize cash towards dividends and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor while continuing to invest to deliver future profitable growth. Having a strong balance sheet is an important asset as we navigate through economic cycles and sustain our investments in new products for existing and new markets. To summarize, we delivered record sales, strong full year earnings in 2022, while managing through supply chain challenges and a very weak demand environment in China.As we move through 2023, demand for our products remains strong in most of our core markets with good visibility into the first half of the year. We'll continue to focus on raising margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, generating strong cash flow and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies and penetrate new markets through our New Power business.

You're looking at shares closing up just about 1.6% today, 1% up just about 24 hours before the company's expected to release its earnings report tomorrow after the-- after the bell. Allie Canal joining us now with a preview on what we can expect. Allie, there's a lot going into this, Bob Iger is back, there's lots of questions about the tone that he's going to really use on the earnings call, the proxy fight, where do you start?ALLIE CANAL: I think number one is Bob Iger, he's sort of the not-so elephant in the room, he's this larger-than-life force, he's beloved on Wall Street, he's beloved by investors. And the Street is pretty bullish if he's going to come in here, and he's going to strike a very clear tone, prioritize DTC profitability over subscriber gains. And for that reason, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw those 2024 subscriber numbers revised down a little bit because of that emphasis on profitability.And besides just streaming, I think there's a strong emphasis on the theme parks, especially the domestic theme parks. Disney already said that the holidays were particularly strong at the parks, and that should greatly aid Disney's bottom line moving forward. But if you think about Disney+, that is expected to take a little bit of a dip in the quarter due to the absence of the IPL tournament on its Indian brand Disney+ Hotstar. However I think in the medium to long term there is this bullish sentiment, especially as streaming losses are expected to improve to less than $1.3 billion in the first quarter versus a loss of $1.5 billion in Q4. So a lot to track as you said between the parks, between streaming, and then of course, the return of Bob Iger.DAVE BRIGGS: Certainly a loss of subs on the cricket. I understand those aren't as valuable as subs as they would be in other countries such as this one. I'm curious what we might hear about this plan to potentially license content to their competitors, what do we know?Story continuesALLIE CANAL: Yeah. And that was an interesting strategy that they came out with, especially because Disney has always been known for loving their content, keeping it to themselves, right? These streaming exclusives. That's a strategy that Netflix has had really success in with all their Netflix originals. So I think we are going to need more clarification, more information about this strategy.And I think that's priority number one for investors, what is the streaming strategy, what do you do with Hulu, what do you do with ESPN? There is a lot of varying opinions on this on the Street but I think if you look at something like Hulu, which obviously has strong content with shows like ""The Bear,"" ""Only Murders in the Building,"" there is this sense of should Disney sell it to Comcast or maybe another buyer to de-lever some of that balance sheet to help with some of the debt that they have.And then on top of all this, of course, you have Nelson Peltz and the Trian Fund, pushing you know, operational changes to the company overall. So there's going to be a lot of questions on this earnings call. And it will be interesting to see what Bob Iger chooses--DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.ALLIE CANAL: --to address first and set as his really main priority to start the year.DAVE BRIGGS: Disney's board has been pretty clear on the pushback to Trian and to Nelson Peltz. Do you really think they'll address it? And do you think we'll hear anything about layoffs, you're hearing a whisper that Bob Iger may come in with a hatchet.ALLIE CANAL: I definitely think we're going to hear something about layoffs, something about restructuring. I think overall this company is one that needs to cut costs. This could be you know, sort of focused in certain areas of the business, like the linear side of the business for example. NBC Universal just a few weeks ago did the same thing, announcing different cost-cutting strategies for linear specifically. But Disney has been teasing layoffs, teasing this restructuring--DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.ALLIE CANAL: --for a little bit. So I'd be very surprised if we didn't hear anything on that. And in regards to Peltz, I don't think Iger will address it unless he's specifically asked by an analyst on the call. But overall I think he's going to try and stay clear of that.DAVE BRIGGS: And in all likelihood, there's-- I mean, every analyst that comes on wants an answer on Hulu and ESPN to your prior point, just not sure you're going to get anything on either one. We've long been told that Bob Iger is a huge fan of ESPN, strong relationship with Jimmy Pitaro and the sports products there. So in all likelihood, those analysts are going to be disappointed on both. The Hulu relationship will likely extend as well. Won't they both kind of stay as they are?ALLIE CANAL: I agree at least for this quarter, right? And I think maybe what we get on the strategy front could give a little bit of a hint to how they will approach Hulu and how they will approach ESPN, but I think, again priority number one is just laying out the strategy, what are we as a company? Are we want to-- do we want to rely on what we do best, which is family-friendly content, focus on just Disney+, or do we like the fact that we have Hulu, that we have this adult content, that we're a little bit more diversified? I don't think we have that answer yet when it comes--DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.ALLIE CANAL: --to their overall streaming strategy. So there needs to be more clarity there.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly does need to be more clarity there. Of course, we will be watching that, looking at the earnings report, and then also have it covered for everyone after the call special following the earnings call that we will get from Disney tomorrow.]"
291,80299121-9dee-34a4-9153-27056a370e28,EXC,2023-02-08,Earnings Preview: Exelon (EXC) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-exelon-exc-q4-150003734.html,1675782003,STORY,"['EXC', 'EXCVV', 'FE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Exelon (EXC) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -52.2%.Revenues are expected to be $4.52 billion, down 53.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon?For Exelon, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of +4.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Exelon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, FirstEnergy (FE), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.53 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.84 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for FirstEnergy has been revised 7.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FirstEnergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Accordingly, the comparable baseline period is April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022.

Currency-neutral financial information is calculated to exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates. References to adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of the company's litigation reserve, the company's 2020 restructuring plan, and related impairment charges, including goodwill and related tax effects. Where applicable, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share exclude the non-cash amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, any gain or loss on extinguishing the company's convertible senior notes, and related tax effects, and any gain or loss from divestitures (including associated earn-outs and expenses) and related tax effects. Management believes these adjustments are not core to the company's operations. The reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to GAAP is presented in supplemental financial information furnished with this release. All per-share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. In addition, in connection with its change in fiscal year-end from December 31 to March 31, Under Armour is presenting select non-GAAP financial measures for the twelve months beginning on April 1, 2021, and ending March 31, 2022, to provide comparable reference periods against the company's new fiscal 2023 year, which began April 1, 2022, and ends on March 31, 2023. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation. They should be contemplated in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the company's reported results prepared per GAAP. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.About Under Armour, Inc.Under Armour, Inc., headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, is a leading inventor, marketer, and distributor of branded athletic performance apparel, footwear, and accessories.

297,798e40bf-19fe-3fd2-8a97-368542a75e2a,AKAM,2023-02-08,Analysts Estimate Akamai Technologies (AKAM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-akamai-technologies-akam-150003590.html,1675782003,STORY,"['AKAM', 'LYFT']","[Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cloud services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.8%.Revenues are expected to be $903.32 million, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Akamai Technologies?For Akamai Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Akamai Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Akamai Technologies would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.26, delivering a surprise of +2.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Akamai Technologies doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Services industry, Lyft (LYFT) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.10 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +11.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.16 billion, up 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Lyft has been revised 0.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 42.37%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Lyft will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He said the company is still committed to Assurance IQ, an insurance-distribution platform acquired for $2.35 billion in 2019.The charge resulted from a “decline in the fair value of Assurance IQ” driven by lower expected earnings growth, a higher discount rate applied to future cash flows, and lower peer valuations, Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential said in a statement. The Assurance unit reported operating income of $29 million, for its first quarter without a loss.Investment losses at Prudential totaled $1 billion in the quarter.

Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Prudential Financial, Inc.’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements. Certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements can be found in the ""Risk Factors"" and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" sections included in Prudential Financial, Inc.’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements herein are subject to the risk, among others, that we will be unable to execute our strategy because of market or competitive conditions or other factors. Prudential Financial, Inc. does not undertake to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.NON-GAAP MEASURESConsolidated adjusted operating income and adjusted book value are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this release.We believe that our use of these non-GAAP measures helps investors understand and evaluate the Company’s performance and financial position. The presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described below. Adjusted book value augments the understanding of our financial position by providing a measure of net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations separate from the portion that is affected by capital and currency market conditions, and by isolating the accounting impact associated with insurance liabilities that are generally not marked to market and the supporting investments that are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income under GAAP. However, these non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for income and equity determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive these measures are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial position. The schedules accompanying this release provide reconciliations of non-GAAP measures with the corresponding measures calculated using GAAP. Additional historic information relating to our financial performance is located on our website at investor.prudential.com.Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. Adjusted operating income excludes ""Realized investment gains (losses), net,"" as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.Realized investment gains (losses) within certain businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are designated as trading. Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value of equity securities that are recorded in net income.Adjusted operating income excludes market experience updates, reflecting the immediate impacts in current period results from changes in current market conditions on estimates of profitability, which we believe enhances the understanding of underlying performance trends. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of Divested and Run-off Businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations, and discontinued operations and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, each of which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes other items, such as certain components of the consideration for acquisitions, which are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, and goodwill impairments. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP and excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable IRS and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.Adjusted operating income does not equate to ""Net income"" as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described above.Adjusted book value is calculated as total equity (GAAP book value) excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the cumulative effect of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurements and currency translation adjustments corresponding to realized investment gains and losses. These items are excluded in order to highlight the book value attributable to our core business operations separate from the portion attributable to external and potentially volatile capital and currency market conditions.FOOTNOTES(1)Highly liquid assets predominantly include cash, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of other U.S. government authorities and agencies, and/or foreign government bonds.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial (HIG) and Old Republic International ORI.Industry: Insurance - MultilineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2050394/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-multiline-insurance-industryProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., The Hartford Financial and Old Republic International. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With seven hikes in interest rate in 2022, already one this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services.Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products as well as exposure to intangible assets offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas.With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte. However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk.The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bright outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by the analysts for the current year.Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months.

306,c16e3c17-599a-32eb-bf12-e211bf7e69b7,DVN,2023-02-08,Devon Energy (DVN) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-dvn-earnings-expected-150003530.html,1675782003,STORY,['DVN'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Devon Energy (DVN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.65 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Devon Energy?For Devon Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.49%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Devon Energy would post earnings of $2.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of +2.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Devon Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

307,2924212b-fc27-3577-893d-3871c04cf7d1,DVN,2023-02-08,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Baker Hughes Company, EOG Resources and Devon Energy",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-baker-122512811.html,1675772712,STORY,"['EOG', 'DVN', 'BKR']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 7, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Baker Hughes Company BKR, EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corp. DVN.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Permian Oil Drilling Rig Count Up in 4 of Last 10 WeeksIn its weekly release, Baker Hughes Company stated that the U.S. rig count was lower than the prior-week tally. The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Falls: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 759 for the week ended Feb 3. The figure is lower than the prior week’s count of 771. Thus, since June 2020, the upstream energy players have cut the count of oil and gas rigs by the most. The current national rig count is, however, higher than the year-ago level of 613.The onshore rigs in the week ended Feb 3 totaled 745, lower than the prior week's count of 756. In offshore resources, 12 rigs were operating, lower than the prior week’s count of 13.U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls: The oil rig count was 599 in the week ended Feb 3, lower than the prior-week figure of 609. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is, however, up from the year-ago figure of 497.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Decreases: Natural gas rig count of 158 is lower than the prior-week figure of 160. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is, however, higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 116. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.2% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Story continuesRig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 21 units, in line with the prior-week count. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 738 is lower than the prior-week level of 750.Gulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Falls: GoM rig count was 12 units, all oil-directed. The count was lower than the prior-week number of 13.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 345, lower than the prior week's count of 350. The tally increased in four of the prior 10 weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $70-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources and Devon Energy Corp., as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG can reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Devon Energy is a well-known upstream energy firm with a strong multi-basin portfolio. Delaware basin is among the basins that contribute significant oil equivalent production to DVN.The Zacks Rank #3 firm, Devon Energy, has a prolific multi-decade inventory, suggesting a solid production outlook.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.29% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.78%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.94%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the software maker had gained 2.44% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 14.37% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.64% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Oracle as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.19, up 5.31% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $12.39 billion, up 17.9% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.91 per share and revenue of $49.74 billion, which would represent changes of +0.2% and +17.19%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.14% lower. Oracle is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Digging into valuation, Oracle currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.04. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 28.24.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that ORCL has a PEG ratio of 2.26. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.08 at yesterday's closing price.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 145, which puts it in the bottom 43% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

New automated grid management and built-in AI will enable utilities to better orchestrate and control DER and grid-edge devices, boost network visibility with real-time insights, and provide a unified user experience across multiple platforms.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)New Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) alarm triggers also alert staff to critical network information so they can act faster to resolve issues and to commission points and devices quickly to optimize network performance.""Oracle Energy and Water continues to make tremendous investments in its Network Management System (NMS) ADMS platform and complementary solutions,"" said Michael Kelly, associate director for market intelligence and advisory firm Guidehouse Insights. ""In supporting some of the largest IOUs across North America, Oracle is actively demonstrating the reliability and technological sophistication of its ADMS solution.""To see these technologies in action, visit Oracle at DISTRIBUTECH (Booth #1437) or schedule a meeting by emailing energyandwater-events_us@oracle.com.Optimizing grid performanceAn Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS), Oracle Utilities NMS is designed to help utilities meet today's needs and prepare for future needs by monitoring, managing, and effectively optimizing the grid from electric distribution to the edge of the grid. Used by six of the top 10 U.S. utilities, Oracle Utilities NMS supports more than 61 million customers. New features introduced today include:Grid Edge DERMS: Using built-in AI and machine learning, Oracle Utilities NMS now allows utilities to better monitor, control, and optimize behind-the-meter devices. A new web interface with built-in templates allows users to more easily manage strategies and events, such as executing control over load devices including thermostats during high peak load periods.AMI Meter Pinging: It is not uncommon for field crews to restore power following an outage event, only to find that some customers are still without power. This latest release allows crews to ping AMI meters and quickly see if any downstream nested outages remain, avoiding return trips and increasing customer satisfaction.Common Network Viewer: Operations personnel need a consistent user experience to more efficiently view and interact with the distribution network map. This release provides a performant, unified look and feel for touch-enabled map user interaction for Oracle Utilities NMS Flex Operations and Oracle Utilities Operations Mobile Application. This improves the effectiveness of map interactions such as panning and zooming and enhances the display of conductor highlights, phases, text annotations, map backdrops, and other network information.Enhanced Digital Field Enablement: Dispatchers and field supervisors need to have all relevant data at their fingertips as they remotely manage outages and crews. Oracle Utilities NMS Flex Operations also now offers enhanced touch capabilities on tablet-sized devices, enabling workers to more easily swipe and pinch to navigate tables, forms, and maps. Device responsiveness support includes the ability to automatically change the layout to support different screen sizes and screen orientations, such as landscape versus portrait.Open Source Operational Technology Middleware: A new Linux version of Oracle Utilities Live Energy Connect (LEC) provides operations middleware to support fast system and device integrations across all major communications protocols with low integration cost and low complexity. With a field-proven operational message bus and flexible OT architecture, the technology supports extreme scale as a utility's needs grow. For enhanced stability supporting expanding grids, each LEC Server is split into different microservices that can quickly be restarted without bringing down the server. Services also can be clustered—if one fails it is seamlessly replaced by another—with clusters spread across machines to help protect against hardware failure.Story continues""Distribution operators need an integrated ADMS platform that fully models distributed energy resources, expands automated grid management, improves customer service, and reduces costs across operations,"" said Brad Harkavy, vice president of product, Oracle Energy and Water. ""With new features—from stronger control over surging DERs and grid devices to more reliable confirmation of successful restoration efforts—the latest version of Oracle Utilities NMS is fueling grid evolution at scale. As a result, we are enabling dramatic improvements in system stability, efficiency, and safety while driving down operating costs with our focus on productized solutions.""Harmonizing complex distribution networksSeamlessly integrated with Oracle Utilities Live Energy Connect, Oracle Utilities Flex SCADA module is delivered and supported within Oracle Utilities NMS. The latest version includes enhanced alarms to alert staff to critical information on the network and improved limits capabilities to support unlimited limit bands, hysteresis, and temporary limit overrides. Additionally, SCADA engineers can now commission SCADA points and devices faster to help optimize network performance and reduce operational cost.Flex SCADA gives utilities an integrated, real-time grid ADMS platform with a single user interface. It can easily integrate data from existing Distribution Automation, field, consumer and IoT devices, legacy SCADA platforms, DERs, and grid-edge sensor points across a wide array of communications protocols. With the offering, utilities get the core distribution SCADA capabilities required across medium and low voltage networks.About OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud. For more information about Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), please visit us at oracle.comTrademarksOracle, Java, and MySQL are registered trademarks of Oracle and/or its affiliates. CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/utilities-amp-up-grid-performance-with-latest-oracle-network-management-features-301741118.htmlSOURCE Oracle]"

To address these challenges, Oracle today launched Oracle Banking Cloud Services, a new suite of componentized, composable cloud native services.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)The six new services available today provide banks with highly scalable corporate demand deposit account processing; enterprise-wide limits and collateral management; real-time ISO20022 global payment processing; API management; retail onboarding and originations; and new self-service digital experience capabilities. Built on a microservices architecture, they help banks renovate and modernize their business capabilities faster and with less risk.""Banks must innovate to succeed in today's hyper competitive environment,"" said Sonny Singh, executive vice president and general manager of Oracle Financial Services. ""We have built one of the world's most comprehensive suites of cloud-native SaaS solutions so that banks of all sizes can innovate with speed, security, and scale without compromising their existing environments.""The services can run standalone, work seamlessly together, and coexist with existing applications to help banks lower cost and risk while increasing innovation. Banks benefit from faster provisioning and availability – which can be achieved in a matter of minutes – and gain automated patching and reduced disaster recovery switchover times that lower IT costs and burden.""The most recent IDC 2022 Worldwide Industry CloudPath Survey shows that nearly all banks surveyed plan to increase spending on all cloud deployment models,"" said Jerry Silva, Program Vice President, IDC. ""Including private cloud and public cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and software as a service (SaaS), public cloud services are expected to grow at twice the rate of overall IT spending at 15% CAGR over the same five-year period, gaining a larger share of banks' IT budgets.""Story continuesThe new services are built and running on the high performance, scalability, security, and compliance of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, including OCI's Oracle Kubernetes Engine. With most cloud regions available globally, in addition to the most extensive set of distributed options, Oracle Banking Cloud Services can be deployed based on sovereignty or data residency needs. New services include:Oracle Banking Accounts Cloud ServiceCurrent corporate demand deposit account (DDA) solutions are ill-equipped to handle the explosion of ecommerce and digital payments that have caused a massive increase in global banking transactions. PwC estimates the global volume of cashless payments is expected to increase by more than 80% between 2020 and 2025, to reach nearly 1.9 trillion transactions. Oracle Banking Accounts Cloud Service provides highly scalable demand deposit account processing on Oracle Coherence Datagrid Infrastructure. The service has been tested for extreme performance and recorded over 200 TPS per CPU on commodity hardware. It also integrates with a bank's existing process flows and technology so they can modernize their core banking DDA systems to deliver new offerings to the market without disrupting their operation.Oracle Banking Payments Cloud Service Legacy systems can't scale and manage the growing volume and velocity of digital payments from ecommerce and new transaction types. Oracle Banking Payments provides a single engine for real-time payment processing, including cross-border, high-value, bulk, retail, and 24x7 payments. The service is built from the ground up based on an ISO20022 canonical data model and more than 15 leading global payment schemes such as SWIFT, SEPA, and others out of the box.Oracle Banking Enterprise Limits and Collateral Management Cloud ServiceWith the absence of an enterprise-wide system, inefficient monitoring, and poor controls, corporate banks are struggling to manage the influx of defaults. McKinsey estimates that banks using improved models could see a 20-40% decrease in their credit losses. Oracle Banking Enterprise Limits and Collateral Management enables banks to gain a holistic view of their exposure by centralizing the limits definition process and collateral management. The service reduces risk by providing banks with a real-time solution for exposure tracking, credit underwriting, decisions, and approvals.Oracle Banking Origination Cloud Service Today, instant gratification is redefining banking, as customers now expect accounts to be opened quickly, loans to be processed in minutes, and cash disbursed in a matter of hours, all with a high level of process transparency. Oracle Banking Origination offers streamlined processes and automated decisioning that helps bankers deliver tailored onboarding and originations experiences for retail and small business customers. With the service, banks can quickly scale originations across retail asset and liability business lines to efficiently drive higher deposit and credit volumes.Oracle Banking Digital Experience Cloud Service Oracle Banking Digital Experience Cloud Service is a digital banking solution that provides ready-to-go corporate and retail banking experiences that enhance customer service. The solution offers customer and product acquisition in addition to omnichannel contextual digital experiences supported by video, chatbot, AI, and natural language processing (NLP)-based engagement tools. The service also works with the bank's existing technology and third-party services to drive seamless processes.Oracle Banking APIs Cloud Service With more than 1,800 ready-to-deploy business and foundational banking APIs, Oracle Banking APIs Cloud Service empowers banks to establish an open banking platform to accelerate innovation while complying with regulations. The solution equips banks to improve the customer experience and revenue opportunities by embedding their services across a growing ecosystem of partners including ecommerce portals, enterprise software, and more.About OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

And some of that is no doubt due to trade down into our brands,"" Yum's Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said on an earnings call.Taco Bell also relaunched the cult-classic Mexican Pizza in September. That helped same-store sales surge 11%, crushing analysts' estimate for a 6.8% rise.Yum's shares were last up marginally in choppy trading.Investors are watching consumer behavior for signs of pressure that could foretell a recession. Persistently high inflation has caused even some affluent diners to look for cheaper options such as McDonald's, while Chipotle on Tuesday missed profit estimates despite its wealthier core customers eating there more often.Yum is ""able to serve customers at any part of the economic strata"" in the United States, Chief Financial Officer Chris Turner said in an interview.Higher-income customers ordered items like Taco Bell's Double Steak Grilled Cheese Burrito or Pizza Hut's Big New Yorker pizza with six extra-large, foldable slices, he said.Turner declined to provide details about Taco Bell's U.S. traffic levels or how much menu prices rose over the year. He would not say how much of the chain's comparable sales growth was due to higher prices.A soft taco at one New York City Taco Bell location was priced at $2.39 on Wednesday, up 14% from February 2022, according to a Reuters tracker of fast-food prices.Story continuesMost restaurants raised prices last year to offset soaring costs for food and labor. This year, Yum's food inflation costs should moderate into the low- to mid-single digits, Turner said.The launch of ""Melts"" - an individual-sized meal consisting of two slices of pizza and dipping sauce - at Pizza Hut and value deals on wraps at KFC also helped drive traffic. Both brands reported a rise in U.S. same-store sales but weak China sales led to a miss on Wall Street estimates.""In what could be a tough macro for restaurants this year ... Yum should continue to benefit from trade-down (from consumers),"" said UBS analyst Dennis Geiger.Total same-store sales at Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum rose 6% for the three months ended Dec. 31. Analysts had expected a 4.57% increase.Yum also took a 2-point hit to profit from the move to exit Russia.Excluding items, the company earned $1.31 per share in the fourth quarter, beating estimates of $1.26, according to Refinitiv IBES data.(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Hilary Russ in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Jonathan Oatis)]"

Brands, Inc. YUM may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Yum Brands is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for YUM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.27 per share for YUM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for YUM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.85% heading into earnings season.Yum! Brands, Inc.

It can devastate people's lives and create a toxic working environment for all.""We are determined to crack down on workplace cultures of sexual harassment, whether in restaurants or hotels, sports clubs or offices.""We are pleased that McDonald's has signed this agreement to signal their intent to make their restaurants safe places to work.""The improvements they put in place can set an example for others to follow, whether in the hospitality industry or elsewhere.""]"

If customers pare spending, it could be a sign that the United States is headed toward a recession.Persistently high inflation across product categories has caused even some affluent diners to look for cheaper options such as McDonald's.Comparable sales at California-based Chipotle rose 5.6% in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, while analysts on average expected a 7.1% rise, according to Refinitiv IBES.The chain reported profit of $8.29 per share, an increase of 48.6%. Analysts on average expected profit of $8.90.Visits to Chipotle restaurants fell 10.2% in the fourth quarter, according to data from Placer.ai. McDonald's visits rose 29.4% in the same period.Even so, Chipotle continued to enjoy steady demand for its pricier menu items from its relatively wealthier customer base, Chipotle Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol said during a call with investors.""We continue to see the higher-income consumer, the individual that earns over $100,000, coming more often,"" Niccol said. ""We made the decision not to go chasing people with discounts. That's not what our brand is.""Traffic also turned positive at the end of the quarter and continued to grow in January, he said.Niccol said the chain's Garlic Guajillo Steak provided a ""lower-than-expected benefit"" during the fourth quarter after it expanded across the United States and Canada.Delivery transactions also tumbled 15% as in-store orders surged, and Chipotle restaurants ""didn't see that pop"" that they normally get in December around the holidays, Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said on the call.Story continuesChipotle forecast comparable sales growth in the high-single digits for the current quarter and said it expects to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023.It did not provide longer-term projections because ""we don't know what's going to happen in the economy. We think inflation will be reasonably tame,"" Hartung said, adding that the company had not yet decided whether to raise menu prices further in 2023.Revenue rose to $2.18 billion from $1.96 billion in the quarter, missing estimates of $2.23 billion.Falling prices for avocados, along with higher menu prices, helped the chain reduce food, beverage and packaging costs to 29.3% of total revenue in the quarter, a decrease of 230 basis points - despite higher costs for cheese, tortillas, beans, rice and salsa.Despite losing some lower-income customers, ""the trade-off of modestly lower transactions, but significantly higher margins, is something investors should readily accept,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh wrote in a note.In a survey of 1,000 Chipotle customers, BTIG found that 45% of customers earning $75,000 or more visited one of the chain's restaurants a few times per month or more.Its price hikes ""had little impact on Chipotle's typical, most loyal consumer,"" Saleh wrote.In 2022, Chipotle's rewards program grew 20% to 31.6 million members, the company said.

While most people don’t need to worry about their jobs being replaced in the short term, AI could mean that people are expected to do more with less. AI platforms like ChatGPT still need human input and direction, so it won’t completely wipe out every job. Right now, it's a tool to be used to increase output and efficiency. But the future could be different.MarketingAt its core, marketing is storytelling, and many aspects of idea creation and storytelling can be generated by AI, including what to say and how to target an audience.RAD AI is a startup that spent $20 million developing a platform that does just that. The technology, which claims to be the “world’s first AI marketing platform built to understand emotion,” is already being used by some of the largest companies in the world. RAD raised over $2.6 million on Wefunder, a platform used by retail investors to invest in startups.In case studies posted on its website, RAD says it increased the return on investment (ROI) of a marketing campaign by 2x on average and increased the productivity of a marketing campaign by 300%.RestaurantsFast food jobs often have high turnover rates and low pay, making them ripe for conversion to AI.McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD), the largest restaurant chain in the world, integrates AI into many of its stores. McDonald's recently launched its first-ever robot restaurant, which is almost completely automated. While self-checkouts and robotic implementation have slowly crept into its stores, this restaurant marks the first completely automated experience.McDonald’s isn’t alone. Dozens of major brands are experimenting in the sector. Jamba Juice has seven robotic kiosk locations where customers can order a smoothie made and delivered by a robot. Jamba, partnering with the startup Blendid, created an adaptable robotics platform where brands like Jamba can lease kiosks to deliver fresh foods autonomously to consumers with a smaller, cheaper retail footprint. Blendid has contracted for 500 more kiosks. It is currently raising on StartEngine, which means anyone can invest in Blendid for a limited time.Story continuesTo stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterWriting, SEO and GhostwritersChatGPT, an AI writing platform, threatens writing jobs. The program was built for the purpose of creating conversational-sounding content. It’s so convincing that schools worry that students will use it to cheat.Buzzfeed’s stock nearly doubled when it announced plans to implement ChatGPT into its content plans. While this action doesn’t necessarily translate to people being fired, it does mean that companies will expect the current workforce to do more with less and will probably slow hiring in fields like writing where AI use is an expected part of the job.It's likely to make a dent in the ghostwriting and search engine optimization (SEO) writing markets. When a story is written by one person and published under someone else's name (like a company blog post), AI could write the post just as well and much more cost-effectively.While using AI could potentially hinder a post's SEO ranking, ChatGPT uses knowledge collected from SEO posts, making it almost perfect at the task. You can ask ChatGPT to optimize a post for SEO for a specific word, which it can do better than a human writer.Customer ServiceChatGPT and similar AI platforms are designed to be responsive, conversational chatbots, and customer service is a logical implementation of the technology. Several startups are already creating customer service products using ChatGPT APIs.One company, Certainly, says anyone can “create a support bot in minutes that generates explainable, brand-compliant responses.” Certainly, like many others, is built on the ChatGPT platform. In fact, it's such an easy process to create a chatbot that people can find beginner guides on creating their own ChatGPT chatbots on YouTube and Medium.While human customer service agents may respond too slowly or tarnish your brand if they are having a bad day, ChatGPT responds instantly and never behaves in anger or frustration.Security GuardsChatGPT will likely have a harder time replacing security guards. But robots are already replacing or supplementing existing security forces around the U.S.A few companies and startups in this sector are already making this happen. Knightscope Inc. (NASDAQ: KSCP) has a suite of robots that patrol, monitor, report and perform security tasks and functions. Its robots are being used by police departments, casinos, apartments and other facilities around the U.S.The only other major player in the industry is SMP Robotics, which creates similar types of robots.CouriersAmazon first decided to use drones in 2013, and a decade later, it rolled out its drone delivery program. Prime Air is available in a handful of cities and is largely underutilized by the delivery giant, but business is likely to pick up the pace in the future.From a self-driving Tesla Semi to Starship’s Food Delivery robot fleet, robots powered by AI are beginning to dominate the delivery sector. The industry will soon see exponential change.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.No Wheelchair Fit This Founder's Needs so He Built His Own and Now It's Backed by TechStars and an XTC Global FinalistNever Lose Your Things Again — The Startup Pouring Gasoline on the Apple AirTagDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis travel website operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +600%.Revenues are expected to be $343.79 million, up 42.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TripAdvisor?For TripAdvisor, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +112.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that TripAdvisor will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TripAdvisor would post earnings of $0.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.28, delivering a surprise of -28.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TripAdvisor appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsExpedia (EXPE), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.85 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +74.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.68 billion, up 17.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Expedia has been revised 28.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 7.34%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggests that Expedia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

337,8e0ac41c-0c11-3dff-80a3-bbf112e3518d,BSX,2023-02-08,A Look At The Fair Value Of Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-boston-scientific-140031284.html,1675778431,STORY,['BSX'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.12bUS$2.76bUS$3.25bUS$3.42bUS$3.83bUS$4.13bUS$4.38bUS$4.59bUS$4.77bUS$4.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.77%Est @ 6.06%Est @ 4.86%Est @ 4.03%Est @ 3.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$2.0kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$91bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$91b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$44bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$68b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$47.7, the company appears about fair value at a 0.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.934. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Boston ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

This compares to earnings of $3.37 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.52%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drugmaker would post earnings of $3.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.01, delivering a surprise of 8.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Vertex , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $2.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.50%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.07 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Vertex shares have added about 5.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.1%.What's Next for Vertex?While Vertex has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Vertex: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.61 on $2.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $15.44 on $9.45 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Biomedical and Genetics is currently in the top 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Non-GAAP financial measures for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 have been recast to reflect this change.Full Year 2022 ResultsProduct revenue increased 18% to $8.93 billion compared to 2021, primarily driven by the rapid uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and the continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. Net product revenue in 2022 increased 8% to $5.70 billion in the U.S. and increased 41% to $3.23 billion outside the U.S., compared to 2021.Story continuesGAAP and Non-GAAP net income increased by 42% and 53%, respectively, compared to 2021, primarily due to strong product revenue growth and lower acquired in-process research and development expenses (""Acquired IPR&amp;D""). Increased revenues were partially offset by increased investments in our mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline, the costs to support the launches of Vertex’s therapies globally, and higher income taxes. Acquired IPR&amp;D in 2021 included a one-time $900 million payment Vertex made in connection with the amendment of the collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics in the second quarter of 2021.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 were $10.8 billion, compared to $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2021.

The program does not have an expiration date and can be discontinued at any time. Please refer to Note 2 for further details.Full Year 2023 Financial GuidanceVertex today provided full year 2023 financial guidance. Vertex’s CF product revenue guidance includes expectations in the U.S. for continued performance of TRIKAFTA in ages 6+ and approval and launch of TRIKAFTA in the 2-5 age group, as well as continued uptake of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in ages 6+ in countries outside the U.S., including those with recent reimbursement agreements. This guidance includes an approximately 150-basis-point negative impact from changes in foreign currency rates, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. Vertex’s combined Non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense guidance includes expectations for continued investment in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs, commercial and manufacturing capabilities, and approximately $300 million of upfront and milestone payments from existing collaborations and our anticipated transaction with Entrada Therapeutics.Vertex’s guidance is summarized below:FY 2023CF product revenues$9.55 to $9.7 billionCombined GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses (3)$4.35 to $4.6 billionCombined Non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses (3)$3.9 to $4.0 billionNon-GAAP effective tax rate21% to 22%Key Business HighlightsCystic Fibrosis (CF) Marketed ProductsVertex anticipates the number of CF patients taking our medicines will continue to grow, including through new approvals for the treatment of younger patients. Recent progress includes:Updated estimates of the number of people living with cystic fibrosis from 83,000 to 88,000 people in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Canada.Filed a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom for the use of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in children 2 to 5 years of age. The FDA granted Priority Review designation and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of April 28, 2023.Filed an sNDA with the FDA and an MAA with the EMA for the use of KALYDECO in children from 1 month to &lt;4 months of age. The FDA granted Priority Review designation and assigned a PDUFA date of May 3, 2023.Potential Near-Term Launch OpportunitiesVertex is preparing for the following potential near-term new product commercial launches:Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), formerly known as CTX001, in severe sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT): In December 2022, Vertex completed regulatory submissions for exa-cel with the EMA and MHRA in the EU and the U.K., respectively. Both the EMA and the MHRA have validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), indicating acceptance of the marketing applications and initiation of the review. Exa-cel has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation in the EU and Orphan Drug designation in the EU and the U.K. Vertex initiated the rolling submission of its biologics licensing application (BLA) in the U.S. in November 2022 and expects to complete the submission by the end of Q1 2023. In the U.S., exa-cel has been granted Fast Track, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations.VX-548 in acute pain: Vertex continues to enroll the Phase 3 pivotal program for its lead compound, VX-548, for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain and expects to complete the pivotal program in late 2023 or early 2024. VX-548 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations in the U.S. for moderate to severe acute pain.Vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, the next-in-class triple combination, in cystic fibrosis: Vertex completed enrollment in the pivotal SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 trials, which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor relative to TRIKAFTA in patients with CF 12 years of age and older. Vertex expects to complete the SKYLINE studies by the end of 2023. In parallel, Vertex has also initiated a study of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with CF 6 to 11 years of age, known as the RIDGELINE study.R&amp;D PipelineVertex is delivering on a diversified pipeline of potentially transformative small molecule, mRNA, cell and genetic therapies aimed at serious diseases. Recent and anticipated progress for programs in clinical development is summarized below.Cystic FibrosisVertex continues to pursue next-in-class, small molecule CFTR modulator therapies as well as an mRNA therapy for the approximately 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators alone.In December, the FDA cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for VX-522, a CFTR mRNA therapeutic, which Vertex is developing in collaboration with Moderna. The goal of this therapy is to treat the underlying cause of CF by programming cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein, and it is aimed at the treatment of the approximately 5,000 people with CF who do not produce any CFTR protein. Vertex has initiated a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial for VX-522 in people with CF, which is active and enrolling patients. Vertex expects to complete the SAD and initiate the multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in 2023. In the U.S., the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for VX-522.Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell DiseaseExa-cel is a non-viral ex vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy, which is being developed as a potential functional cure for TDT and SCD. Vertex is developing exa-cel in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics.The Phase 1/2/3 CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 studies and the CLIMB-131 long-term follow-up study are ongoing in patients 12 years of age and older.Two additional Phase 3 studies of exa-cel in pediatric patients with TDT and SCD continue to enroll patients.Neuropathic Pain (NaV1.8)Vertex has discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 with the objective of creating a new class of pain medicines that have the potential to provide effective pain relief, without the limitations of opioids and other currently available medicines.In the fourth quarter, Vertex initiated a Phase 2 dose-ranging study of VX-548 in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain.APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD)Vertex has discovered multiple oral, small molecule inhibitors of APOL1 function, pioneering a new class of medicines that target an underlying genetic driver of kidney disease.Vertex continues to enroll the pivotal program for its lead compound, inaxaplin, in a single Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with AMKD and expects to complete the Phase 2B dose-ranging portion of the study in 2023.Inaxaplin was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for APOL1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), as well as Orphan Drug and PRIME designations by the EMA for AMKD.Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)Vertex is evaluating cell therapies using stem cell-derived islet cells to replace the endogenous insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of developing a potential functional cure for this disease.Vertex completed enrollment in Part B of the Phase 1/2 study of VX-880 and expects to present updated clinical data from the VX-880 study at a scientific congress in 2023. After Part B of the study is complete, Vertex intends to begin Part C of the study, with concurrent dosing, in 2023.In December 2022, Vertex submitted an IND in the U.S. and a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in Canada, for VX-264, the cells plus device program. The CTA has been cleared, and Vertex plans to begin screening, enrollment and dosing in Canada in the coming months. In the U.S., the IND has not cleared, and the program is on hold.In September 2022, Vertex closed the acquisition of ViaCyte, a regenerative medicine company focused on delivering novel stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies as a potential functional cure for T1D. A Phase 1/2 study of VCTX-211, a hypoimmune cell program that Vertex is developing in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics, is active and enrolling patients.Alpha-1 Antitrypsin DeficiencyVertex is working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency by developing novel small molecule correctors of Z-AAT protein folding, with a goal of increasing the secretion of functional AAT into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of AAT deficiency.Vertex initiated a 48-week Phase 2 study of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on polymer clearance from the liver, as well as the resultant levels of functional AAT (fAAT) in the plasma.Additionally, Vertex continues to enroll a first-in-human clinical trial for VX-634, a small molecule AAT corrector in healthy volunteers. VX-634 is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties compared to previous Vertex AAT correctors, allowing potential exploration of the full dose response.Other Internal Innovation and Pre-Clinical DevelopmentConsistent with its overall strategy, Vertex takes a portfolio approach to all of its programs, with additional assets in CF, SCD, TDT, AMKD, T1D, pain and AATD in earlier stages of development.Vertex is also bringing forward preclinical assets in new disease areas, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Additionally, Vertex is working on preclinical molecules with the potential to expand our leadership in existing disease areas, including assets targeting gentler conditioning for exa-cel and NaV1.7 in pain.Investments in External InnovationConsistent with its strategy to develop transformative medicines for serious diseases, Vertex previously announced a global research collaboration with Entrada Therapeutics focused on therapeutics for DM1. The collaboration includes Entrada’s program for DM1, ENTR-701, which is in late preclinical development. Under the terms of the agreement, upon closing, which is anticipated to occur this month, Vertex will make an upfront payment of approximately $224 million to Entrada, as well as an equity investment of approximately $26 million.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results and guidance exclude from Vertex's pre-tax income (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) gains or losses related to the fair value of the company's strategic investments, (iii) increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) an intangible asset impairment charge and (vi) other adjustments. The company's non-GAAP financial results also exclude from its provision for income taxes the estimated tax impact related to its non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income described above and certain discrete items. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for the company’s GAAP results and are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position that the company believes is helpful to an understanding of its ongoing business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally, to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. The company’s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures likely differs from the calculations used by other companies. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.The company provides guidance regarding combined R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. Unless otherwise noted, the guidance regarding combined GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses does not include estimates associated with any potential future business development transactions, including collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights. The company does not provide guidance regarding its GAAP effective tax rate because it is unable to forecast with reasonable certainty the impact of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the possibility of certain discrete items, which could be material.Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedConsolidated Statements of Operations(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months EndedDecember 31,Twelve Months EndedDecember 31,2022202120222021Revenues:Product revenues, net$2,302.7$2,072.6$8,930.7$7,573.4Other revenues———1.0Total revenues2,302.72,072.68,930.77,574.4Costs and expenses:Cost of sales283.3247.41,080.3904.2Research and development expenses694.1567.82,540.31,937.8Acquired in-process research and development expenses (3)22.6126.5115.51,113.3Selling, general and administrative expenses267.4255.2944.7840.1Change in fair value of contingent consideration1.8(2.0)(57.5)(3.1)Total costs and expenses1,269.21,194.94,623.34,792.3Income from operations1,033.5877.74,307.42,782.1Interest income86.01.2144.64.9Interest expense(11.6)(15.1)(54.8)(61.5)Other (expense) income, net(31.1)7.1(164.8)4.9Income before provision for income taxes1,076.8870.94,232.42,730.4Provision for income taxes257.9100.8910.4388.3Net income$818.9$770.1$3,322.0$2,342.1Net income per common share:Basic$3.19$3.02$12.97$9.09Diluted$3.15$3.00$12.82$9.01Shares used in per share calculations:Basic256.9254.6256.1257.7Diluted260.3257.0259.1259.9Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income and Operating Income(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months EndedDecember 31,Twelve Months EndedDecember 31,2022202120222021GAAP net income$818.9$770.1$3,322.0$2,342.1Stock-based compensation expense111.5118.6491.3441.4Decrease (increase) in fair value of strategic investments(5)6.0(12.1)149.1(17.1)Increase (decrease) in fair value of contingent consideration (6)1.8(2.0)(57.5)(3.1)Intangible asset impairment charge (6)——13.0—Acquisition-related costs (7)3.52.838.811.3Total non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income *122.8107.3634.7432.5Tax adjustments (1) *36.3(100.8)(101.7)(261.9)Non-GAAP net income *$978.0$776.6$3,855.0$2,512.7Net income per diluted common share:GAAP$3.15$3.00$12.82$9.01Non-GAAP *$3.76$3.02$14.88$9.67Shares used in diluted per share calculations:GAAP and Non-GAAP260.3257.0259.1259.9Three Months EndedDecember 31,Twelve Months EndedDecember 31,2022202120222021GAAP operating income$1,033.5$877.7$4,307.4$2,782.1Stock-based compensation expense111.5118.6491.3441.4Increase (decrease) in fair value of contingent consideration (6)1.8(2.0)(57.5)(3.1)Intangible asset impairment charge (6)——13.0—Acquisition-related costs (7)3.52.838.811.3Non-GAAP operating income *$1,150.3$997.1$4,793.0$3,231.7Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Expenses(in millions, except percentages)(unaudited)Three Months EndedDecember 31,Twelve Months EndedDecember 31,2022202120222021GAAP cost of sales$283.3$247.4$1,080.3$904.2Stock-based compensation expense(2.4)(1.7)(9.4)(6.3)Non-GAAP cost of sales$280.9$245.7$1,070.9$897.9GAAP research and development expenses$694.1$567.8$2,540.3$1,937.8Stock-based compensation expense(68.0)(71.9)(297.9)(268.3)Intangible asset impairment charge (6)——(13.0)—Acquisition-related costs (7)(2.8)(2.8)(24.9)(11.3)Non-GAAP research and development expenses *$623.3$493.1$2,204.5$1,658.2Acquired in-process research and development expenses *$22.6$126.5$115.5$1,113.3GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses$267.4$255.2$944.7$840.1Stock-based compensation expense(41.1)(45.0)(184.0)(166.8)Acquisition-related costs (6)(0.7)—(13.9)—Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses$225.6$210.2$746.8$673.3Combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses *$871.5$829.8$3,066.8$3,444.8GAAP other (expense) income, net$(31.1)$7.1$(164.8)$4.9Decrease (increase) in fair value of strategic investments(5)6.0(12.1)149.1(17.1)Non-GAAP other expense, net$(25.1)$(5.0)$(15.7)$(12.2)GAAP provision for income taxes$257.9$100.8$910.4$388.3Tax adjustments (1) *(36.3)100.8101.7261.9Non-GAAP provision for income taxes *$221.6$201.6$1,012.1$650.2GAAP effective tax rate24.0%11.6%21.5%14.2%Non-GAAP effective tax rate18.5%20.6%20.8%20.6%*Starting in the first quarter of 2022, Vertex no longer excludes research and development charges resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights from its Non-GAAP financial measures.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.29%.

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $9.98 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.43% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?For Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Coke will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coke would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of +7.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Coke appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPepsiCo (PEP), another stock in the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.64 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $26.85 billion, up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for PepsiCo has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.15%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend capture strategy and past performance of high dividend stocks, and go directly to read Dividend Capture Strategy: 5 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in February. Dividend capture strategy is one of the most popular techniques employed by short-term investors. The strategy involves buying dividend stocks before their ex-dividend dates and selling them after receiving the payouts. Investors often follow this technique because it offers the potential for price appreciation. If the stock price increases after the payout, the investor can sell the stock for a profit. Moreover, this strategy can be a source to generate stable income in a short time, especially if the dividends are above-average.Dividend stocks’ returns over the years have shown their solid performance during inflationary periods. According to a report by AMG Funds, dividend payments of the S&amp;P 500 Index have grown at an annual average rate of 6% over the past five decades, which is well above the inflation rate in the US. The report cited data from Ned Davis Research and mentioned that since 1979, dividend-payers outplayed non-dividend companies in periods where 10-year Treasury was rising.When following a dividend investment strategy, investors seek stocks with healthy yields in order to supplement their income. Moreover, these securities also have a potential for capital appreciation and can help investors diversify their portfolios. In 2021, high-yield dividend stocks in the US Total Cap outperformed non-dividend payers by 39.6%, as reported by IHS Markit. Similarly, high-dividend stocks performed better than non-dividend stocks in developed Europe during the same year. In addition to dividend yields, shareholders also evaluate these stocks in light of the respective company’s financial health, growth prospects, and future dividend policy. With decades-long dividend growth streaks under their belt, dividend growers become investors’ top choices when the market is uncertain. Some examples of such stocks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

Recovery across markets and channels, a nag for innovative products, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, market share growth, and improved pricing have been the key trends in the Beverage industry, which are expected to have bolstered the performances of participants in the fourth quarter of 2022.Beverage companies have been putting their best foot forward to spice up their product lines. The companies have been continually developing products by blending the best qualities of different drinks, which has been blurring the lines between product categories. Notably, the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol category since 2018.Beverage companies are also expected to have gained from accelerating digital investments. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers to expand their digital capabilities. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sales of beverage companies.However, players in the beverage industry are anticipated to have witnessed higher advertising and promotional expenses, and SG&amp;A costs. These are expected to have hurt margins in the quarter under review. Elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, are expected to have resulted in increased costs of sales and higher operating costs, denting the gross and operating margins in the to-be-reported quarter.How to Identify Potential Outperformers?With the fourth-quarter earnings season in full swing, it is worthwhile to invest in companies with earnings beat potential, as a stock generally rallies on an earnings beat.A strategy to arrive at the potential winners is by picking stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

(NYSE:WM) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-ownership-shares-waste-management-120101387.html,1675857661,STORY,['WM'],"[A look at the shareholders of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Waste Management. View our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Waste Management does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Waste Management's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Waste Management is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 7.5% of the stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Waste Management, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$125m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Waste Management. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Waste Management , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.02%, on average.Factors to NoteVeriSign’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from continued healthy growth across .com and .net domain name registrations. The company is expected to have gained from growing Internet consumption globally.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVeriSign, Inc. price-eps-surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteVRSN ended third-quarter 2022 with 174.2 million .com and .net domain name registrations, up 1.2% year over year.Per the company, domain name registrations increased 11.5 million or 3.4% year over year. However, it decreased 1.6 million or 0.4% sequentially to 349.9 million across all top-level domains at the end of third-quarter 2022.The growth is likely to be affected due to higher domain name registrations witnessed in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, which has slowed down in 2022. Also, further weakness in registrations from China may have acted as a headwind.Escalating operating expenses related to cybersecurity and infrastructure spending are likely to have weighed on the company’s fourth-quarter operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Also, ongoing uncertainty prevailing over the global macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability in Europe remain concerns.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for VeriSign this time around.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Trane Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Evoqua Water has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TT is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.68, while AQUA has a forward P/E of 52.05. We also note that TT has a PEG ratio of 2.06. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AQUA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.47.Another notable valuation metric for TT is its P/B ratio of 6.98. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AQUA has a P/B of 8.15.These metrics, and several others, help TT earn a Value grade of B, while AQUA has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesTT sticks out from AQUA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that TT is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

380,d1ed60f4-2545-3524-8a8d-db645b0db811,GE,2023-02-08,Checkout.com’s CFO will become president and COO with a plan to disrupt payments in the U.S.—and take on Stripe,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/checkout-com-cfo-become-president-120128741.html,1675771288,STORY,['GE'],"[Good morning,“I think 2023 is definitely going to be about payments efficiency and acceptance rates and optimization for the bottom line,” Céline Dufétel of Checkout.com, a London-based online payments company, told me.Dufétel was promoted from CFO to president of the company last week; she'll retain her COO function. She is based in New York and leading the expansion into the U.S. to become a disruptor of legacy systems in the payments industry. Checkout.com plans to take on fintech competitors like Stripe. But meeting a challenge isn't something new to Dufétel. While studying applied mathematics, economics, and finance at the École Polytechnique in Palaiseau, France, she served in the French navy and was the only woman serving on a 200-person oil tanker.Some of Checkout.com’s global customers include Sony, Alibaba, and the crypto exchange company Binance. In the U.S., Checkout.com has launched a partnership with GE HealthCare to standardize its global payments. Through a single API integration, the company can accept payments across all of its key markets, offering the local payment methods, according to Checkout.com.GE HealthCare is an independent company following its recent spin-off from General Electric. “The digital layer is becoming more and more important in our industry,” GE HealthCare CFO Helmut Zodl told me in December.Dufétel, who joined Checkout.com in August 2021, will keep the COO responsibilities under her umbrella, including all operational and go-to-market teams (like finance and marketing). While in her previous post—as COO and CFO of T. Rowe Price—she earned a spot on Fortune’s 2020 40 Under 40 list. Nirupam Sinha, SVP of corporate finance and strategy at Checkout.com, was promoted to CFO. Sinha, joined the company in November 2021, also coming from T. Rowe Price.But fintechs have cooled off somewhat, at least in the eyes of investors. In early 2022, Checkout.com announced it raised $1 billion in its Series D funding round at a valuation of $40 billion. By the end of the year, the company reduced its internal tax valuation to around $11 billion. Similarly, Stripe, which was valued by private investors at $95 billion in 2021, cut the internal value of its shares by 28% in July.Story continues“When you compare us to Stripe, the common point is both provide end-to-end proprietary technology, where you’ve got direct integration into local payment methods, as opposed to legacy incumbents that have been cobbled together through M&amp;A,” Dufétel explains. And that has “created a very disjointed experience for merchants,” she says. But that's where the similarities end, as Checkout.com is focused on enterprise merchants, and ""Stripe has its roots in the SMB [small and midsize business] world,"" Dufétel says.In this macroenvironment, Checkout.com is providing services “we really think a CFO or a chief product officer needs right now,” Dufétel says. An example? “We give you much more transparency into the fees and help you remediate any declines,” she explains. And the company engages with merchants to proactively help them optimize their payments, she says. “If you think about very sophisticated, large enterprise clients, that's the kind of white-glove service that they're looking for,” Dufétel says.Payment services provider Stripe is being watched closely at the moment. It’s reportedly in talks to raise new funding at a steep discount from its last valuation, Fortune reported. However, leadership change is on the horizon. Dhivya Suryadevara, CFO at Stripe since 2020, announced Feb. 2 in a LinkedIn post that she will step away from her role at the company to attend to family matters. As is the case with many tech companies, Stripe announced a round of layoffs in November, about 14% of its workforce.Checkout.com has been building the marketing, sales, and customer success teams in the New York office, Dufétel says. Along with Dufétel, part of the finance, legal, and HR teams are also represented. “It takes time to hire and to train people, so it’s part of the multi-year effort,” she says.In her new role, Dufétel is looking forward to continuing to drive growth for Checkout.com. She no longer wears a CFO hat, but her finance know-how is a mainstay.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Valero Energy's shares before the 13th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.02 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.92 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Valero Energy has a trailing yield of approximately 2.9% on its current stock price of $134.52. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Valero Energy has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 13% of its income after tax.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Valero Energy has grown its earnings rapidly, up 27% a year for the past five years. Valero Energy looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Valero Energy has lifted its dividend by approximately 21% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Valero Energy for the upcoming dividend? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. Valero Energy ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Valero Energy that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. We think most investors would be happy with the 108% return, over that period. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.Although UnitedHealth Group has shed US$19b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, UnitedHealth Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 16% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for UnitedHealth Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 124%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that UnitedHealth Group returned a loss of 3.0% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 9.3%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 18%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN, LKQ Corp LKQ, Rivian Automotive RIVN.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:3 Auto Stocks Poised to Deliver Q4 Earnings BeatsWe are entering the peak of the fourth-quarter earnings season for the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the picture thus far looks pretty decent despite supply chain issues and economic worries that the space is grappling with. So far this earnings season, five S&amp;P sector components — namely Tesla, PACCAR, General Motors, Ford and Cummins have come up with quarterly numbers.Tesla, PACCAR and General Motors not only managed to pull off a comprehensive beat but also witnessed year-over-year growth in the top and the bottom lines. Meanwhile, Ford and Cummins missed earnings estimates but witnessed year-over-year growth in profits and sales.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified a few auto players — Allison Transmission Holdings, LKQ Corp, Rivian Automotive — which are positioned to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings.What’s Shaping the Q4 Earnings Season for Auto Stocks?The fourth quarter of 2022 was a mixed bag for the auto space, with some automakers witnessing a year-over-year increase in the number of vehicles sold while others saw a decline. In general, what aided the industry was the gradual abatement of chip woes and a slight improvement in supply chain systems. As such, inventory levels were on the rise. Inventory levels in December were more than one million units for the third consecutive month, per J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. Per TrueCar, the total new light-vehicle inventory, including fleet and commercial vehicles, totaled 1.8 million in December 2022, up from 1.1 million recorded in December 2021.Story continuesDespite economic uncertainty, demand for vehicles largely managed to show resilience during the last three months of 2022. The rising deliveries of new energy vehicles (including all-electric, hybrids and fuel-cell) are expected to have fueled revenues. However, for the less-affluent and subprime consumers, the rising cost of financing is expected to have played spoilsport.Per estimates of J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, average interest rates for new vehicle loans were up around 250 basis points from the year-ago levels. High interest rates eat away vehicle buyers' willingness and ability to purchase. This may have limited revenues to some extent.As for the average price of vehicles, used car prices are on a decline, while new car prices during the quarter under discussion have remained high. High new vehicle prices are likely to have offset commodity cost inflation partially. High costs of raw materials, manufacturing inefficiency, rising freight and fuel costs may have limited margins.Per the latest Earnings Trend report dated Feb 1, the auto sector’s earnings for Q4 are expected to grow 62.1% on a year-over-year basis. As for revenues, they are estimated to rise 21.4% year over year.Picking Potential WinnersWhile it is not possible to be sure about which companies are well positioned to beat earnings estimates, our proprietary methodology — Earnings ESP — makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with the abovementioned combination, the chances of an earnings beat are as high as 70%.Our ChoicesBelow we list three auto stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off a beat this earnings season.Allison: Strategic buyouts and frequent product launches are likely to aid Allison’s upcoming results. FracTran, TerraTran and 3414 Regional Haul Series along with Allison’s eGen Power portfolio are likely to have secured business wins, thereby aiding fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from ALSN’s North America On-Highway segment is pegged at $327 million, up from $281 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company’s upbeat 2022 projections also spark optimism for the upcoming quarter’s results.Allison has an Earnings ESP of +3.06% and a Zacks Rank #3.

QuoteLKQ: The increase in the average age of vehicles (12.2 years according to IHS Markit data) is likely to have positively impacted sales of LKQ’s products.

You can skip our detailed analysis on dividend capture strategy and past performance of high dividend stocks, and go directly to read Dividend Capture Strategy: 5 High-Yield Stocks to Buy in February. Dividend capture strategy is one of the most popular techniques employed by short-term investors. The strategy involves buying dividend stocks before their ex-dividend dates and selling them after receiving the payouts. Investors often follow this technique because it offers the potential for price appreciation. If the stock price increases after the payout, the investor can sell the stock for a profit. Moreover, this strategy can be a source to generate stable income in a short time, especially if the dividends are above-average.Dividend stocks’ returns over the years have shown their solid performance during inflationary periods. According to a report by AMG Funds, dividend payments of the S&amp;P 500 Index have grown at an annual average rate of 6% over the past five decades, which is well above the inflation rate in the US. The report cited data from Ned Davis Research and mentioned that since 1979, dividend-payers outplayed non-dividend companies in periods where 10-year Treasury was rising.When following a dividend investment strategy, investors seek stocks with healthy yields in order to supplement their income. Moreover, these securities also have a potential for capital appreciation and can help investors diversify their portfolios. In 2021, high-yield dividend stocks in the US Total Cap outperformed non-dividend payers by 39.6%, as reported by IHS Markit. Similarly, high-dividend stocks performed better than non-dividend stocks in developed Europe during the same year. In addition to dividend yields, shareholders also evaluate these stocks in light of the respective company’s financial health, growth prospects, and future dividend policy. With decades-long dividend growth streaks under their belt, dividend growers become investors’ top choices when the market is uncertain. Some examples of such stocks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

This compares to FFO of $0.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.92%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shopping center real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.47 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.46, delivering a surprise of -2.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Macerich , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $228.23 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $229.4 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Macerich shares have added about 22.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.1%.What's Next for Macerich?While Macerich has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Macerich: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.43 on $213.58 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.84 on $890.29 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Don't Ignore These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002170.html,1675778402,STORY,['ORLY'],"[Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) earns a Zacks Rank #3 one day from its next quarterly earnings release on February 8, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.82 a share.O'Reilly Automotive's Earnings ESP sits at 1.38%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $7.82 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.71.ORLY is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Tapestry (TPR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on February 9, 2023, Tapestry holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.30 a share two days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tapestry is $1.26, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.82%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ORLY and TPR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

ORLY may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because O'Reilly is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORLY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $7.82 per share for ORLY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.71 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORLY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.38% heading into earnings season.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. price-eps-surprise | O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ORLY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for O'Reilly, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Eaton is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ETN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.06 per share for ETN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ETN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.55% heading into earnings season.Eaton Corporation plc Price and EPS SurpriseEaton Corporation plc Price and EPS SurpriseEaton Corporation plc price-eps-surprise | Eaton Corporation plc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

""The American Fork junior broke course records in his final six races last fall, vanquishing an unprecedented slate of elite challengers made up of national record-holders and multiple sub-4 milers to take silver at Nike Cross Nationals.

405,ff11426d-f3c4-3805-b585-64b8950a32d0,PEP,2023-02-08,Coca-Cola (KO) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-ko-expected-beat-150003522.html,1675782003,STORY,"['KO', 'PEP']","[Coca-Cola (KO) is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $9.98 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.43% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?For Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Coke will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coke would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of +7.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Coke appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPepsiCo (PEP), another stock in the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.64 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $26.85 billion, up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for PepsiCo has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.15%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recovery across markets and channels, a nag for innovative products, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, market share growth, and improved pricing have been the key trends in the Beverage industry, which are expected to have bolstered the performances of participants in the fourth quarter of 2022.Beverage companies have been putting their best foot forward to spice up their product lines. The companies have been continually developing products by blending the best qualities of different drinks, which has been blurring the lines between product categories. Notably, the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol category since 2018.Beverage companies are also expected to have gained from accelerating digital investments. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers to expand their digital capabilities. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sales of beverage companies.However, players in the beverage industry are anticipated to have witnessed higher advertising and promotional expenses, and SG&amp;A costs. These are expected to have hurt margins in the quarter under review. Elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, are expected to have resulted in increased costs of sales and higher operating costs, denting the gross and operating margins in the to-be-reported quarter.How to Identify Potential Outperformers?With the fourth-quarter earnings season in full swing, it is worthwhile to invest in companies with earnings beat potential, as a stock generally rallies on an earnings beat.A strategy to arrive at the potential winners is by picking stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

If you want to explore some of Ken Fisher's top dividend stock picks, you can go to 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher.Ken Fisher is an American billionaire investor, author, and philanthropist. He is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a Washington-based money management firm. Fisher is the author of eleven books, six of which are best-sellers. Fisher has received wide coverage for his analysis and investment philosophy and is also a noted philanthropist. As of February 6, 2023, Ken Fisher has an estimated net-worth of  of $7.2 billion.Ken Fisher's Market Outlook For 2023: ""The Midterm Miracle"", Recession, and InflationKen Fisher also runs a YouTube channel where he debunks investing myths and also offers his analysis of capital markets. On January 20, Ken Fisher shared his market outlook for 2023 and why he thinks the year may be good for stocks. Ken Fisher said that ""everything about 2022, makes 2023 look like it's going to be a pretty good year"" for stocks and he believes this because ""third years of U.S. presidents' terms, which is what 2023 is, tend to be overwhelmingly positive"". Ken Fisher said that in the history of the stock market, we have only had two instances of when the third years of U.S. presidents' terms were down years for the markets. Ken Fisher has a strong belief about ""the midterm miracle"" which he defines as the fourth quarter of the prior year, and the first two quarters of the next year. According to Ken Fisher's estimates, ""those nine months collectively are the most consistently profitable nine-month span in U.S. stock market history, positive 92% of history with an overall 20% positivity"". Ken Fisher backed his views by explaining that historically whenever the second year of the president's term was negative, the third year was surprisingly positive with ""big returns"". Here are some comments from billionaire Ken Fisher:Story continues""When you look at the first year of presidents' terms, they're positive about half the time and negative about half the time, in history. And when they've been positive, they've been pretty big most of the time. The second year, similarly so, not quite as much. (Positive) about half the time, often pretty big when they're positive, half the time not. But when that second year is negative,  the third year is like a spring board and the returns have been even higher, the average third year of presidents' term has returns that have averaged about 20%. The third-year returns when the second year is negative are over 30%, on average. These are big numbers and I don't want you to underestimate the power of that.""Ken Fisher also noted that ""there is this endless fear of recession"". Fisher said ""we're either in one, or we're not"" and explained why he thinks we are currently not in a recession. He said that the stock market is a prominent indicator of recession and noted that after the market bottomed at the close of Q3 2022, it ""has been rising through the fourth quarter"". Fisher said that ""if we're in recession now, it's got to be a mild one since sales, corporate revenue, and GDP are moving along just fine"". Moreover, ""lending remains robustly strong"" on a domestic and global basis, noted the billionaire. Ken Fisher believes that we cannot be in recession with ""robust lending"". Here are some comments from Ken Fisher about why he believes we are not in recession:""When businesses and people borrow short to intermediate term funds, they tend to spend them pretty quickly, they tend not to sit on them.  And that robust lending does not speak to a weak economy immediately ahead, it speaks to  sentiment being dour now. And sentiment being dour now is because the stock market was weak in 2022, and dour sentiment is a bullish feature looking forward.""Finally, Ken Fisher spoke his thoughts about inflation and why he believes it will continue to decelerate. According to Fisher, inflation is ""output pricing"". Fisher said that inflation is ""the final price you are paying to buy something in a store or wherever you buy it"". Ken Fisher made a distinction that inflation is the ""output price"" and not the price of raw materials or ""input prices"". Here are some comments from Ken Fisher about inflation:""The inflation war, no thanks to the Federal Reserve or other central banks, has largely already been won. Grain prices are down, crude oil prices are down, most metals are down, lumber prices are down, the prices of most of the inputs of things that we later buy as finished goods, those inputs have been falling. It only takes time for that to translate into a positive inflation effect. When I say positive inflation, winning the inflation war is not going back to the price of the final input prices that used to exist, it's returning to the kind of low-levels of inflation that we lived with for a very long time that nobody complained about. And that is not terribly far ahead in 2023, and is a terribly positive surprise for most everyone"".Ken Fisher believes that 2023 should be a positive year for capital markets and that ""the surprises should end up on the positive side"".This article will look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher, some of which include Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:JPM)Fisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,088,792,000Percentage of Fisher Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 0.73%Dividend Yield as of February 6: 2.84%On January 17, Citi analyst Keith Horowitz raised his price target on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Trading at about a TTM PE ratio of 11x and offering a forward dividend yield of 2.84%, as of February 6, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the best cheap dividend stocks in Ken Fisher's 13F portfolio.On January 13, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced strong earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $34.55 billion, up 18.08% year over year and ahead of consensus by $320.96 million. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”10.

CVX is a leading integrated oil company with exploration, production, and refining operations. It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

410,69e73b26-a5df-3362-aa7d-e65b7f75ed1e,AMP,2023-02-08,Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) Is Up 2.80% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-2-170005901.html,1675789205,STORY,['AMP'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ameriprise Financial Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AMP that show why this financial services company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor AMP, shares are up 2.8% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry is up 2.49% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.28% compares favorably with the industry's 5.66% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Ameriprise Financial Services have risen 9.51%, and are up 12.54% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 9.44% and -7.24%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to AMP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. AMP is currently averaging 506,154 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AMP.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AMP's consensus estimate, increasing from $29.09 to $30.66 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AMP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A.

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Cisco Systems'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:29% = US$12b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.29 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 29% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Cisco Systems has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 10% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 20% net income growth seen by Cisco Systems over the past five years. growthNext, on comparing Cisco Systems' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 24% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CSCO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Cisco Systems Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cisco Systems has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 54%, meaning that it is left with only 46% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Additionally, Cisco Systems has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Cisco Systems' performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Cisco Systems (CSCO) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.87 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 15, 2023.Cisco Systems' Earnings ESP sits at 1.66%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.87 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86.CSCO is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Texas Instruments (TXN) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Texas Instruments, which is readying to report earnings on April 25, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.76 a share, and TXN is 77 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesTexas Instruments' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.36% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CSCO and TXN could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

QuoteFactors to Note Ahead of Q4 EarningsCloudflare’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the solid demand for security solutions, which became imperative due to aggravated cyberattacks, work-and-learn-from-home policies and a zero-trust approach.The to-be-reported quarter’s top line is likely to have witnessed the impact of the accelerated global footprint expansion outside the United States. It is worth mentioning that the United States, the EMEA and the APAC represented 53%, 27% and 13% of the total revenues, respectively, in the third quarter.Moreover, a diversified customer base is likely to have contributed to NET’s fourth-quarter top line. It added around 4,197 new paying customers in the last reported quarter, bringing the total count to approximately 156,000 across more than 170 countries.Cloudflare added 159 new large customers (annual billings of more than $100,000), taking the total count to 1,908 at the end of the third quarter, up from the 1,749 recorded at the end of the second quarter of 2022. This uptrend, which has prevailed for the past few quarters, is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by the elevated demand for its cloud-based solutions amid the ongoing remote-working trend.Story continuesThe company's recurring subscription-based business model has been providing relative stability to its top line amid post-pandemic disruptions. It expects variability in cash flow margins due to working capital fluctuations, large enterprise business growth and seasonal factors.However, Cloudflare’s significant exposure to small and medium businesses, the worst-hit cohorts by the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, is likely to have weighed on its performance in the quarter to be reported.What Our Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NET this season.
