0,4b755a5d-ad13-35c5-9c50-0e5b83b2efe8,SCHW,2023-09-12,Should Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF (SCHX) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-u-large-cap-etf-102007142.html,1694514007,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[Launched on 11/03/2009, the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF (SCHX) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $33.92 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.45%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 28.10% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.96% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 28.06% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHX seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market measures all U.S. equity securities with readily available prices. The index includes approximately the largest 750 stocks and is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted.Story continuesThe ETF has added about 18.43% so far this year and was up about 11.67% in the last one year (as of 09/12/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.25 and $54.21.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 18.19% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 757 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHX is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $350.62 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $413.19 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Per a Bloomberg report, the company intends to eliminate hundreds of jobs across its trading and investment bank (IB) divisions, while separately, Reuters reported that BCS is considering trimming approximately 400 jobs in its retail banking business as part of its broader strategic review.Persons familiar with the matter noted that Barclays plans to eliminate around 5% of its client-facing employees in the trading business, along with a number of dealmakers globally, and restructure teams within its U.K. consumer-banking business.This is part of Barclays’ annual evaluation of performance and this round of cuts were unrelated to the one in the retail banking operation. The sources knowing the matter stated that some retail employees could be transferred or made redundant on a voluntary basis.The performance of the capital markets business has been discouraging since the past year. Even in the first half of 2023, the company's Global Markets income and Investment Banking fees decreased 25% and 11%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.On the second-quarter earnings call, C.S. Venkatakrishnan, CEO of Barclays, said, “We have delivered on our cost guidance this quarter and remain committed to driving a lower cost-to-income ratio over time.” Over the medium term, the cost to income ratio is targeted to be below 60%.Over the past six months, shares of BCS have gained 2.5% compared with the industry's upside of 7.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, Barclays carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

5,85d2af6c-99e9-33ee-b6ab-69346706fb84,SCHW,2023-09-12,Trex and MasterCraft have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trex-mastercraft-highlighted-zacks-bull-121400094.html,1694434440,STORY,"['TREX', 'GSBD', 'SCHW']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 11, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Trex Company TREX as the Bull of the Day and MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. MCFT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, UBS Group AG UBS and The Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Trex Company is seeing resilient consumer demand in 2023. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has beat on earnings 3 quarters in a row.Trex is a manufacturer of high-performance, low maintenance and eco-friendly wood-alternative decking and railing. Its products are stocked in more than 6,700 retail locations worldwide, including at Home Depot and Lowe's.A Big Earnings Beat in the Second QuarterOn July 31, 2023, Trex reported its second quarter results and easily blew by the Zacks Consensus, reporting earnings of $0.71 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.54. That's a 31.5% beat.It was the third consecutive earnings beat in a row. Trex has only missed twice in the last 5 years.Revenue was $357 million, which was down 5% from last year's revenue of $386 million as the channel was building inventory. It saw margin expansion, however, with gross margin of 43.9% compared to 40.7% a year ago.Trex saw mid-single digit growth in the channel sell through as consumer demand remained resilient.The company also launched Trex Select T-Rail system, a value priced composite railing that rounds out its portfolio at the entry level. It is designed to compete with PVC vinyl railing.Announced Full Year GuidanceTrex has improving visibility so it was finally able to provide full year 2023 revenue guidance. It expects revenues to range from $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion. This is below last year's revenue of $1.11 billion. It's still rebounding from last year's inventory build.The analysts are more bullish, however, as the Zacks Consensus is calling for $1.08 billion, above the company's guidance range.Story continuesThe analysts are also bullish on earnings as well. 9 estimates were revised higher in the last 2 months which pushed the Zacks Consensus up to $1.76 from $1.61. This is still 2.2% below last year's earnings of $1.80, however.But looking forward, the analysts are even more bullish on 2024 as the Zacks Consensus has jumped to $2.11, which is earnings growth of 19.7%.Trex Was a Big Pandemic WinnerAs we stayed home during the pandemic, what did we do? We put on new decks. Trex was a huge pandemic winner as its shares soared.But in 2022, the stock sold off along with the other growth stocks, only to rally again in 2023. Shares of Trex are up 59% year-to-date as the consumer has kept spending and the US has avoided a recession. But on a 2-year stack, it's still down 40%.Timing matters.Trex saw an opportunity while its shares were lower. In the second quarter, Trex repurchased 264,896 shares for $16 million.On a P/E basis, Trex is not a ""cheap"" stock. It trades with a forward P/E of 39.1.But for those investors who believe that the consumer will continue to spend on their home, Trex is one to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:The boom times are over for MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expecting to see a dramatic decline in earnings and sales in Fiscal 2024.MasterCraft designs and manufactures recreational powerboats through three brands: MasterCraft, Crest and Aviara. It has two segments of the powerboat industry, performance sport boats and pontoon boats, while also entering the luxury day boat segment.Retail Sales Slowed in Fiscal Q4 2023On Aug 30, 2023, MasterCraft reported its fiscal fourth quarter 2023 and full year 2023 results. The pandemic was a catalyst for the boating industry as consumers bought boats during the lock downs to be outdoors.Fiscal 2023 was the third consecutive record year for earnings and sales for the company. It was also the most profitable fiscal year in the Company's history as net sales rose to $662 million, up 3.2% over the prior year.It saw the highest cash flow in the company's history at $134 million. Times were good.MasterCraft also beat on the fiscal fourth quarter for the 13th time in a row. It reported earnings of $1.37 versus the Zacks Consensus of $1.08.It has an excellent earnings surprise track record with just one miss in the last 5 years.But as the fourth quarter progressed, MasterCraft saw retail sales slow significantly. It reduced production plans but dealer inventories at the end of fiscal 2023 were at higher levels than the company would consider optimal.Fiscal 2024 Guidance Was Below Consensus“Macroeconomic factors, including elevated interest rates as well as tightening credit standards and availability, are creating significant uncertainty which is limiting our retail demand visibility,"" said Fred Brightbill, CEO.""In addition, the general expectation for an economic downturn during fiscal 2024 will likely be a headwind for the industry.""As a result, it guided net sales to be between $390 million and $420 million, well under the $662 million it made in fiscal 2023.The earnings guidance was in the range of $1.46 to $1.88, well below the consensus of $4.03.As a result, the analysts have had to slash their earnings and sales estimates. 5 earnings estimates have been cut since the Q4 earnings report which has pushed the Zacks Consensus down to $1.81.That's at the high end of the company's guidance range, but it is still 66.2% below the record $5.35 the company made last year.Shares Plunge in the Last MonthWith earnings and sales expected to fall sharply in fiscal 2024, it's not surprising that the shares fell on the news. They're down 22.4% in the last month.Over the last year, they're up, but just 0.7%. Will they re-test the Sep 2022 lows soon?Shares are cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.8.With the record free cash flow, the company has been buying back shares. MasterCraft bought back $22.9 million in shares in fiscal 2023.But with the possibility of a recession looming, investors should probably stay away from this boat manufacturer until there is visibility on the consumer.Additional content:Goldman Sachs Plans New Round of Job CutsThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is planning another wave of job cuts that could take place as soon as next month, per Financial Times article.This is a part of its yearly practice of letting go of those employees who are deemed to be the lowest performers.The expected move usually affects between 1-5% of GS’ total staff. It is aiming to cut jobs at the lower end of the range, primarily in its main business divisions like investment banking and trading.Markedly, GS has undergone a minimum of three phases of layoffs since last September. These initiatives are part of the company's deep cost-savings drive amid slump in deal making activity.Reportedly, in June 2023, Goldman announced job cuts of more than 30 IB positions across the Asia region and considered firing around 125 managing directors across the globe.Further, during the first quarter of 2023, GS trimmed its headcount by 3,200, marking its biggest round of layoffs since 2008 financial crisis. In September last year, the company also announced an employment reduction of about 500 jobs.Goldman’s shares have lost 4.2% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 2.6%.GS presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereSimilar to Goldman, UBS Group AG and The Charles Schwab Corp. have been reducing their workforce.Reportedly UBS is expected to cut around 3,000 jobs in Switzerland in the upcoming period. It had been planning on workforce reduction at Credit Suisse post its acquisition in order to save costs. UBS expects that during the integration of Credit Suisse more staff would leave on their own accord.Such job cuts are being planned by UBS as it aims to achieve gross cost reductions of more than $10 billion by the end of 2026.SCHW announced a business streamlining plan as part of its cost-saving measures. Per the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company will slash jobs and close or downsize its corporate offices with an aim to achieve at least $500 million in annual cost savings.In addition to cost efficiencies associated with the integration of TD Ameritrade (acquired by SCHW in October 2020), the above-mentioned action is a step taken to simplify its business to better prepare for the post-integration period.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

6,4c60171b-aa04-395c-bf6c-8e6e4c7dd775,NUE,2023-09-12,Nucor Insiders Sold US$14m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-insiders-sold-us-14m-120203076.html,1694433723,STORY,['NUE'],"[The fact that multiple Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Nucor Nucor Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Leon Topalian, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$168 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$165. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Nucor insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Nucor Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Nucor. Specifically, insiders ditched US$11m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Nucor Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Nucor insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$242m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Nucor Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Nucor (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Of course Nucor may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

However, thanks to interest rates, the Federal Reserve, and growing fears of a recession, we’ve seen some cracks in the armor. In fact, according to Forbes, we could see a recession in the first half of 2024, or possibly later this year. While that’s the last thing any of us want to hear, we can’t ignore the potential. That being said, you may want to start protecting your portfolios – which we can start doing by getting rid of risky bets, including these top S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell.S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Sell: Royal Caribbean (RCL)Serenade of the Seas cruiseSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.comRoyal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is one of the world’s prominent cruise companies. It’s also one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell.In July, the company revenues of $3.5 billion – a 61% jump year over year. Operating income jumped $772 million from an operating loss of $219 million, year over year. Demand still looks solid for the company, as well. Even better, the cruise industry could see a massive pick up in passenger volumes. All could lead to double-digit growth for Royal Caribbean.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, while its stock has since recovered, Royal Caribbean is still struggling with debt. At the end of the second quarter, the company had long-term debt of just over $18.7 billion. Debt it owes within a year is up to $1.7 billion. All of which carry sky-high interest rates. Worse, as noted by Motley Fool contributor Brett Schafer, “Every year from 2023 to 2027, the company will need to pay back at least $2 billion in loans, which will need to be funded by free cash flow. Royal Caribbean has only ever generated more than $2 billion in free cash flow one year in its history, 2017.”PulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comIt’s no secret that rising interest rates are making life more difficult for the housing market. Mortgage rates have surged back to levels not seen in 20 years, which has negatively impacted housing affordability and demand.Story continuesGranted, housing stocks, such as PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) have been strong, up 103% over the past year. However, that upside may not last. All thanks to soaring interest rates, and homeowners – with low-rate mortgages – refusing to move. For people with a locked-in 4% mortgage, it’s just too expensive to sell their property and get a 7% mortgage on a new house.For the foreseeable future, sustained high-interest rates are going to slam the market for both new and existing homes. That being said, investors should take their wins in PHM before they disappear.S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Sell: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been a popular semiconductor stock this year thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). It’s also another one of the top S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell.While AMD is seen as strong competition to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), it won’t dethrone the tech giant just yet. Even with its new AI chip, AMD has to contend with Nvidia’s significant lead in the AI race, as noted by CNBC.And, unlike Nvidia, AMD hasn’t been able to turn its AI ambitions into cold hard cash as of yet. Perhaps AMD will start making serious dough in AI in 2024. In any case, AMD stock is awfully risky after its 70% year-to-date rally despite its sharply weaker earnings results.Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL)ODFL logo on the side of a trainSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comOld Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a leading Less-than-Truckload (LTL) cargo operator.Investors generally associate trucking with volatility and low profitability. It’s not a great industry for long-term returns. However, Old Dominion has bucked this trend by focusing on the less-than-truckload niche. This is a specialty business that allows for higher profit margins and more predictable cash flows from operations. We can see its progress in the stock’s 50% move over the last year.Unfortunately, Old Dominion’s earnings haven’t kept up with the stock price. While the ODFL stock trades at about 34x forward earnings, that’s a bit rich for a trucking company. Worse, with a potential recession on the horizon, ODFL stock could be heading for a major breakdown.S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Sell: Nucor (NUE)Nucor logo close-up on website page. NUE stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockSteelmaker Nucor (NYSE:NUE) is a bargain at less than 15x forward earnings.However, there’s a good argument that the steel industry is dramatically overvalued due to the pandemic-induced buying boom. As people bought new appliances, cars, and other steel-hungry durable goods, this caused demand to surge and profit margins to soar.When buying patterns return to normal — let alone when a recession hits — Nucor’s profits will likely slump dramatically. Nucor’s revenues jumped from $22.6 billion in 2019 to $41.5 billion last year. It’s reasonable to assume much of that revenue surge won’t last as economic conditions cool off.Similarly, Nucor’s peak earnings per share (EPS) prior to 2020 was $7.42 per share, which it earned in 2018. Needless to say, the $18/share or so that Nucor will earn this year is unlikely to be a sustainable figure. As the economy slows down, Nucor’s profits will plunge, and the share price is likely to follow suit.American Airlines (AAL)American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flightsSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Airlines (NYSE:AAL) is one of the United States’ biggest air carriers. As we saw with Royal Caribbean, American Airlines also had a rough go during the pandemic. It had to issue tons of new debt and stock to stay afloat. In fact, American Airlines’ long-term debt load surged from $7 billion in 2012 to $21 billion prior to the onset of the pandemic and up to more than $30 billion today. If you count leases, pensions, unearned revenues, and other obligations, the firm’s total long-term liabilities climb well past $45 billion.Many traders may look at American Airlines with its market capitalization of just $9.3 billion and think there’s a bargain here. But American Airlines’ troubles are just the tip of the iceberg compared to the firm’s far larger debt and other obligations.With this context in mind, American Airlines is not cheap at all today as it makes perhaps $2 billion or $3 billion in annual profits during an economic expansion. Profits will be much less — or perhaps return to red ink entirely — during the next recession. AAL stock may seem cheap at first glance, but once you consider the balance sheet, it actually turns out to be frightfully expensive.Iron Mountain (IRM)Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truckSource: ShutterstockMost REITs have struggled over the past year. There are two primary reasons for this. First, rising interest rates make it more expensive to service a REIT’s debts. And in a world where risk-free fixed income pays higher and higher interest, dividend stocks have to offer higher yields to remain competitive.Despite the heavy selling across the REIT industry, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) has so far proven immune. In fact, IRM stock is surprisingly up 28% year-to-date, making it a standout among its peers. Iron Mountain’s business of document storage and security is a better one than many REITs. It isn’t facing the same structural issues as, say, office or shopping mall owners. However, the results still haven’t been that great. Earnings this past quarter slightly missed expectations, and funds from operations (FFO) declined a bit year-over-year.Granted, Iron Mountain’s results aren’t terrible by any means. But it’s rather odd that IRM stock is up so much while having flat-to-slightly down earnings.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

STT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of STTState Street Corporation (STT): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 5/103. Growth rank: 4/104. GF Value rank: 6/105. Momentum rank: 7/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned State Street Corporation the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.State Street Corporation: A SnapshotState Street Corporation, with a market cap of $23.26 billion, is a leading provider of financial services, including investment servicing, investment management, and investment research and trading.

The financial strength rank of 3/10 suggests that the company might be facing some financial difficulties or risks, which could affect its ability to meet its financial obligations.Profitability AnalysisState Street Corporation's low Profitability rank of 5/10 can also raise warning signals. This rank indicates that the company's profitability might be weaker compared to other companies in its industry. This could potentially impact the company's earnings and its ability to generate returns for its shareholders.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where State Street Corporation seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank of 4/10. This suggests that the company's growth rate might be slower than its peers, which could limit its potential for future earnings growth.State Street Corporation (STT): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.67% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.25%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.14%.Coming into today, shares of the company had lost 8.49% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector lost 3.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.73%.Investors will be hoping for strength from U.S. Bancorp as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.08, down 8.47% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.05 billion, up 11.97% from the year-ago period.USB's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.44 per share and revenue of $28.33 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -0.22% and +17.16%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for U.S. Bancorp. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.8% higher.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the animal healthcare market, you can go directly to see 5 Most Owned Dog Breeds in America.In one of our previous articles about the best dog foods, we mentioned that pet ownership around the world is increasing and that having a pet comes with a lot of health benefits for humans. The article also mentions that dogs are by far the most popular pets in the US.The increase in pet ownership is driving growth in the animal healthcare sector. Many people consider pets to be members of their families, and they are willing to invest in their health. As a result, the veterinary healthcare market is becoming a growing field with many opportunities for professionals and businesses in the space.An Analysis of The Growing Animal Healthcare MarketPreviously, during the COVID-19 crisis, temporary lockdowns of manufacturing sites, export bands, and increased focus on treatments for COVID-19 led to supply disruptions and shortages of veterinary medicines in several countries around the world. The pandemic had a negative impact on the animal healthcare market. However, the growing rate of pet ownership and the trend of pet humanization has helped the market recover in a short time.According to a report by Global Market Insights, the global animal healthcare industry was valued at $150.6 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% during 2023-2032, propelling the global animal healthcare sector to reach around $238 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The growing rate of pet adoption for companionship is expected to help the market grow significantly during the forecast period. The increasing importance of the production of livestock animals is also expected to augment growth in the global animal healthcare market. Growing availability of animal healthcare products at supermarkets and hypermarkets is expected to help the market expand in the coming years.Story continuesIn a recent article about the smartest dog breeds, we discussed that a large percentage of cats and dogs as pets in the US were classified as obese or overweight in 2022. Moreover, animals and pets are currently being affected by a number of new diseases, and the animal health sector is positioned to be a leading force for positive change during the forecast period. There has been an increase in new diseases in animals. And as the global population swells, there has been an increase in global consumption of meat and milk. Some of these novel diseases have potential to be transmitted to humans through animal product consumption and companionship. The need for developing treatments, medications and vaccines have provided some of the top players in the market with lucrative opportunities.A Look at the Major Players in the Animal Healthcare MarketThe COVID-19 crisis created new opportunities for market growth, and now eHealth applications and telehealth are becoming more popular, with Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) jumping on the bandwagon too. On May 22, Reuters reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has signed a deal with pet telehealth provider Pawp to offer the retailer's subscribed members access to veterinary professionals, without the need for an appointment, through video or text. According to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Walmart+ customers can use Pawp's services for a year as it looks to tap growing demand for pet telehealth from inflation-hit customers looking for low-priced alternatives. Additionally, the report by Reuters mentions that Petco Health and Wellness Company Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) has also been expanding their telehealth offerings. The well-known health and wellness company for pets pegged the value of the pet industry at $119 billion in 2021.On August 17, Petco Health and Wellness Company Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) also announced an expanded partnership with DoorDash Inc. (NYSE:DASH) to make Petco's (NASDAQ:WOOF) collection of products available nationwide through the DoorDash Inc.'s (NYSE:DASH) DoorDash Marketplace. Pet Parents will now have greater access to Petco's (NASDAQ:WOOF) curated selection of pet health products for on-demand delivery through the DoorDash's (NYSE:DASH) mobile app and website.As the demand for veterinary services rises with new diseases, top market players in the animal healthcare industry are developing and launching new treatments and vaccines in order to enhance their market presence. On May 2, Reuters reported that Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN) received a conditional license from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for its antibody to treat canine parvovirus, making it the first approved therapy. Parvovirus, which is a highly contagious disease and can spread by direct dog-to-dog contact and contact with contaminated feces, causes acute gastrointestinal illnesses such as diarrhea and vomiting. The therapy is a one-shot intravenous treatment and belongs to a class of treatments known as monoclonal antibodies. It is Elanco Animal Health Incorporated’s (NYSE:ELAN) first monoclonal antibody therapy. Jeff Simmons, CEO of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN), said:""This will be the second product that goes into a major global market with blockbuster potential up to $100 million.""On August 7, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.18, beating the EPS estimates by $0.13. The company reported a revenue of $1.06 billion and surpassed revenue estimates by $17.47 million. Here are some comments from Elanco Animal Health Incorporated’s (NYSE:ELAN) Q2 2023 earnings call:“In the U.S., we launched our canine parvovirus monoclonal antibody, a highly anticipated treatment for one of the most contagious and deadly dog viruses. The supply chain is enabling responsiveness and the product is already saving dogs' lives, driving reorders. As expected, in 2023, demand is outpacing supply due to the anticipated capacity limitations in our facility at launch.We are on track to ramp up our capacity to 10x today's volume to support the expected increase in demand in the coming years. This year, we expect revenue contribution of $5 million to $7 million. However, we see this product as an important growth driver to both the top- and bottom-line starting in 2024 and expect blockbuster contribution as we expand outside the U.S. over time.”Investments in research and development projects by key players is also expected to influence the animal healthcare market positively while also contributing to the market’s growth in the coming years. On September 7, Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), the world's largest producer of medicine and vaccinations for pets and livestock, reported that the Zoetis Foundation has allocated $2.6 million in grants to advance opportunities for veterinarians and livestock farmers. The grant will be used towards commitments made to support veterinary scholarships and debt relief, mental well-being, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and livestock farmers and veterinary livelihoods around the world.Now that we have looked at the latest trends in the animal healthcare sector as well as what some of the key market players are up to, let’s take a look at the 30 most owned dog breeds in America.30 Most Owned Dog Breeds in AmericaPhoto by Joel Moysuh on UnsplashMethodologyIn this article, we have ranked the 30 most owned dog breeds in America.

Goldman found stores with lower-income consumers (those with household incomes from $62,000 to $85,000) saw same-store sales increase 5.6% compared to last year in the second quarter. Those stores include the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Ross Stores (ROST), as well as dollar store chains Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Five Below (FIVE).On the other end, retailers with higher-income consumers (median income between $96,000 and $128,000) saw same-store sales decline 2.2%. Those stores included Bloomingdale's (M), RH (RH), Lululemon (LULU), and Nordstrom (JWN).The analysis fell in line with credit card data Goldman Sachs tracks that showed consumer spending has increased 25% since the start of the pandemic in lower-income zip codes. Meanwhile, spending in middle-income (+22%) and higher-income zip codes (+16%) has increased at a slower pace.Goldman Sachs expects this gap to narrow a bit during the current quarter and through the end of the year as other macro headwinds weigh on the consumer.""One key question is whether management guidance appropriately embeds the expected drag from resuming student loan payments, which we expect will weigh on upcoming retail sales and consumer spending reports,"" Hill wrote.Same-store sales in lower-income stores have been more resilient than those in higher-income stores this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs. (Goldman Sachs)In August, Bank of America released an analysis of its card spending data from the start of the year through July. The data showed higher-income spending had been weaker than lower-income spending on a month-over-month basis for four of the first seven months of the year. BofA attributed part of that divergence to the labor market where higher-income individuals are seeing wages increase at a slower pace while more of the cohort is applying for unemployment benefits.Story continuesInvestors will get another update on consumer spending Thursday with the August retail sales report slated for release. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect retail sales increased 0.1% in August, a noted decrease from the 0.7% jump seen in July.CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MAY 18: Customers shop at a Walmart store on May 18, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.

The deal will also involve Kroger divesting the Debi Lilly Design, ReadyMeals, Primo Taglio, Open Nature and Waterfront Bistro private label brands. It will also include the selling of QFC, Mariano's and Carrs brand names.As noted, the deal will include the divestiture of 104 and 66 stores in Washington and California, respectively. In Colorado, 52 Albertsons stores and in Oregon, 49 Albertsons and Kroger stores will be divested. Other stores included in the divestiture agreement are located in several states, including Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Illinois and others.With regard to the divestiture, Kroger will receive about $1.9 billion in cash from C&amp;S, subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory clearance, other customary closing conditions and the completion of the Kroger-Albertsons merger.Kroger may also require C&amp;S to acquire up to another 237 stores in certain geographies to secure FTC and other governmental clearance related to the proposed merger. If these stores are acquired, Kroger will receive an additional cash consideration from C&amp;S.Story continuesWhat’s More?Separately, Kroger also announced its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line beat the same. In the quarter, Kroger posted adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents and increased from 90 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Including a $1.4 billion charge related to a nationwide opioid settlement framework, the company reported a loss of 25 cents per share.Total sales of $33,853 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34,251 million.

A resilient business model enables it to gain market share and generate profits. This operator of membership warehouses has exhibited a decent run on the bourses and has outpaced the industry year to date. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have appreciated about 20.7% year to date compared with the industry’s rise of 2.2%.With a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.8% and a VGM Score of B, Costco has ample scope to attain new highs. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.7% and 9.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.Striking the Right Chord With ConsumersCostco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. A customer-centric approach, strategic pricing, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on memberships have helped Costco post consistent sales growth.Costco’s net sales increased 5% to $18.42 billion for the retail month of August from $17.55 billion last year. This followed an improvement of 4.5% witnessed in July. Comparable sales for the retail month of August — the four-week period ended Aug 27, 2023 — increased 3.4%. This followed an increase of 2.5% registered in July.Costco has emerged as a viable option for bargain hunters looking for essentials and other discretionary purchases amid soaring inflation. We believe a growing customer base and high renewal rates should fuel sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSteadily Adopting the Omnichannel MantraCostco is gradually adopting the omnichannel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics — has boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.Story continuesEnhancing FootprintCostco’s expansion strategy looks pretty impressive. The company remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. In our view, Costco’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets.As of Aug 30, 2023, Costco operates 861 warehouses, including 591 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 33 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 18 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, five in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.We foresee improvement in membership fees as new warehouse openings ramp up. Membership fees increased 6.1% to $1,044 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Costco ended the quarter with 69.1 million paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders.Enough LiquidityCostco’s sturdy balance sheet equips it to deal with cyclical downturns and tap growth opportunities. Solid cash flow generation allows it to raise dividends consistently. The company’s cash &amp; cash equivalents (including short-term investments of $1,215 million) were $13,708 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Costco has always been a favorite pick for investors who are seeking both steady income and growth. This Issaquah, WA-based company, with a strong history of dividend payments as well as sound fundamentals, provides a hedge against any odd swings in the stock market.3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Grocery Outlet GO, Ross Stores ROST and Walmart WMT.Grocery Outlet, an extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products, currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

""Whenever people feel visible, they invest in their appearance.""Prior to COVID-19, the global beauty industry was a $532 billion business, with the US being its largest market, according to the Brazilian industry organization ABIHPEC. Driven by skin care, the US prestige beauty industry amassed a total of $18.8 billion in sales throughout 2019.Today, revenue for the beauty and personal care market amounts to $579 billion and is expected to grow by 3.53% annually, according to Statista estimates.""There's a lot more experimentation,"" Brown added. ""It used to be that you'd have a few products sold for newness. And I think especially with Gen Z, there's a lot more search for newness, and trial and experimentation. The trends cycled through much quicker than they used to.""A shop attendant applies lipstick on her hand for a customer to check the shade at a store in Peshawar, Pakistan, May 22, 2019. (Fayaz Aziz/REUTERS) (Fayaz Aziz / reuters)'The big gorilla': L’OréalThe leaders of the US beauty space include Unilever (UL), Estée Lauder (EL), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Shiseido (SSDOY), LVMH (LVMUY), Beiersdorf (BDRFY), Chanel, Natura &amp; Co, and Coty (COTY).And then there is L’Oréal (LRLCY), which is the largest cosmetics and beauty company in the world.Like many companies, the French conglomerate took a revenue hit in 2020 as COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions weighed on sales. Yet it remained the leader and gained market share as Unilever and Estée Lauder battled for the No. 2 spot. In 2021, L’Oréal's sales rebounded to 32.29 billion euros.""In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic ... triggered a crisis of supply due to the widespread closure of points of sale which led to an unprecedented, if temporary, decline of the beauty market,"" L’Oréal chairman Jean Paul Agon said following the company's Q4 2020 results. ""L’Oréal has traversed this crisis in the best possible condition and has even grown stronger.""Story continuesOne reason for L’Oréal's dominance has been its edge in the hair care category: It's ""the big gorilla in hair"" compared to rivals, Brown told Yahoo Finance.Estée Lauder, meanwhile, has lost market share in the US to L’Oréal. In the company’s recent earnings call, Estée Lauder president Fabrizio Freda said, “We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior-year period.”Despite losses, Estée Lauder is looking to reaccelerate growth across the globe. The cosmetics giant is looking to innovate across its skin care category, enter new markets, and sell inventory to licensees.However, smaller brands are now starting to enter the fray.""The brands that are innovating and marketing effectively behind that innovation will succeed at it,"" Raymond James senior analyst Olivia Tong told Yahoo Finance. ""And that's the [more] important point rather than the size of the company.""Beauty trends driving the industryA few emerging trends in the beauty industry accelerated during the pandemic.When the demand for cosmetics changed suddenly, brands were forced to adapt and many started offering new products.Entrepreneurs Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloe Kardashian took advantage of the shift in consumer demand and used their influence to manufacture and distribute hand sanitizers through Kylie Cosmetics and face masks through SKIMS and Good American brands.

(David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) (David Dee Delgado via Getty Images)Then, throughout the pandemic, millions of consumers took to online shopping.Consequently, e-commerce has become a major factor for the beauty industry, nearly quadrupling between 2015 and 2022, a McKinsey report found, with its share accounting for more than 20%.According to projections, e-commerce will grow at 12% per year between 2022 and 2027, making it the fastest-growing sales channel for the beauty industry.Another element that gained traction is social media, which played a major role in the pivot to e-commerce.""I think social media has been a big game changer for beauty in general,"" Canaccord Genuity managing director Susan Anderson told Yahoo Finance Live in May. ""I think it's really gotten the consumer engaged in the category.""Although beauty sales are dominated by a handful of players, including prestige and private label collections from retailers such as Sephora and Ulta (ULTA), smaller brands such as ColourPop and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) have been able to remain competitive and amass their own loyal followings, in part due to product innovation and social media.E.l.f. cosmetic products are seen for sale in a store in New York City, June 29, 2022. (Andrew Kelly/REUTERS) (Andrew Kelly / reuters)""What I would say about brands like e.l.f., [and] to a lesser extent ColourPop, is what they’ve really, really done well, is they've taken the innovation and the kind of fashion-forward appeal of Sephora brands and they made it very, very affordable,"" Brown said. ""So they move quickly. They're basically fast fashion for beauty.""Others point out that e.l.f. has created value for consumers beyond its price point by offering quality and convenience.""They are not relying just on being the most inexpensive,"" Tong explained. ""They are spending money behind it. … They care about product quality, advertising, partnering with the retailer, all the things that a lot of companies do, and building an audience for that.""That innovation has been an engine for the industry by leading to incremental sales.""When it comes to cosmetics, it's a lot harder to saturate,"" she said. ""Because I may have 10 lipsticks, but if I love the new formulation or I love the new packaging, I can always find space for 11.""Niko Lopez and Mahi Chaurasia attend Sephora At Kohl's VIP Event at Valley Ranch Kohls on Aug. 8, 2022 in Irving, Texas. (Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images for Sephora at Kohl's) (Richard Rodriguez via Getty Images)'Lipstick effect' props up beautyWhile the US has so far been able to stave off a recession coming out of the pandemic, industry execs have been eyeing consumer spending closely for any signs of weakening.""I think the word of the last 18 months has been resilient to describe the consumer,"" Avondale Asset Management founder Scott Krisiloff told Yahoo Finance in July. ""But still the consumer is very resilient, continues to spend, continues to want to have the experiences that the consumer wants to have.""That has especially been the case in the beauty industry, which historically holds up better than other industries during economic downturns due to what experts call ""the lipstick effect.""According to Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research, the lipstick effect occurs when consumers continue to spend on small luxuries, even as they pull back on spending in other areas.Lipstick represents ""an affordable luxury for consumers that may not be experiencing gains in other places,"" Kodali said. ""It's a way to indulge yourself in an affordable way, and it's something that we see happen in almost any type of economic hardship.""The relative strength of consumers has given companies the confidence to make major M&amp;A deals even in an uncertain economic environment, a positive sign for the industry overall. ""The growth in beauty has been built on effective or strategic acquisitions,"" Brown said.In recent decades, M&amp;A has become a core part of L’Oréal’s growth strategy.In April, L’Oréal acquired Australian skin care brand Aesop in a deal that valued Aesop at $2.5 billion. It marked L’Oréal's largest acquisition to date aimed at helping the beauty giant expand its presence in the luxury market and in China, the second-largest beauty market behind the US.In addition to M&amp;A, more beauty brands have looked to expand through brand partnerships with major retailers.In the second quarter, Target (TGT) executives highlighted double-digit growth in the beauty category, driven by in-store Ulta locations, known as shop-in-shops. Department stores such as Macy’s (M) continued to see outperformance from prestige beauty brands such as Estée Lauder. And Sephora locations in Kohl's (KSS) stores offered a bright spot for the retailer.""Sephora at Kohl's continues to exceed our expectations, driving a total beauty sales increase of nearly 90% year over year,"" Kohl's CEO Thomas Kingsbury said in the company's second quarter earnings call. ""We opened nearly 200 Sephora shops in the quarter, and momentum in our existing Sephora shops continues to accelerate with greater than 20% comparable beauty sales growth in the Sephora shops opened in 2021 and 2022.""While some retailers warned that consumers may be growing more cautious, shoppers are still invested in spending across beauty, hair, and skin care.""There isn’t really a slowdown in sight,"" Brown said. ""I don't see the appetite for beauty products changing.""—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top Upgrades: Morgan Stanley upgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $400, up from $250. The firm views Tesla as both an auto and tech company but sees the biggest value driver from here being its software and services revenue.Jefferies upgraded DoorDash (DASH) to Hold from Underperform with a price target of $90, up from $70, saying consensus expectations underappreciate the company's tailwinds to EBITDA from further advertising penetration and enhancements to underlying unit economics.JPMorgan upgraded Tenable Holdings (TENB) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $56, up from $51. The firm sees an ""attractive opportunity"" for better growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow moving through the back half of the year into fiscal 2024 for the company.Deutsche Bank upgraded Kenvue (KVUE) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $27.

While the company's shift to emphasize profitability is understandable, the ""stark"" slowdown in revenue and subscriber growth is concerning, the firm says.JPMorgan downgraded Brunswick (BC) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $79, down from $109. The firm's fieldwork is ""flagging increasingly cautious"" dealer sentiment into the second half of 2023, driven by elevated inventory levels notably in the value-segment, delayed consumer purchases on higher interest rates, and greater reliance on incentives to drive conversion.Wolfe Research downgraded Evergy (EVRG) to Peer Perform from Outperform without a price target.

The stock's valuation is ""compelling"" when set against the company's growing sales and potential for both margin expansion and de-levering in the years ahead, the firm says.Barclays initiated coverage of Blue Bird (BLBD) with an Overweight rating and $25 price target. The firm believes a slowdown in the rate of change of orders and backlogs compressing likely keeps the stock's risk/reward more balanced than the opportunity set ahead of the industry.Jefferies initiated coverage of SharkNinja (SN) with a Buy rating and $67 price target.

Goldman found stores with lower-income consumers (those with household incomes from $62,000 to $85,000) saw same-store sales increase 5.6% compared to last year in the second quarter. Those stores include the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Ross Stores (ROST), as well as dollar store chains Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Five Below (FIVE).On the other end, retailers with higher-income consumers (median income between $96,000 and $128,000) saw same-store sales decline 2.2%. Those stores included Bloomingdale's (M), RH (RH), Lululemon (LULU), and Nordstrom (JWN).The analysis fell in line with credit card data Goldman Sachs tracks that showed consumer spending has increased 25% since the start of the pandemic in lower-income zip codes. Meanwhile, spending in middle-income (+22%) and higher-income zip codes (+16%) has increased at a slower pace.Goldman Sachs expects this gap to narrow a bit during the current quarter and through the end of the year as other macro headwinds weigh on the consumer.""One key question is whether management guidance appropriately embeds the expected drag from resuming student loan payments, which we expect will weigh on upcoming retail sales and consumer spending reports,"" Hill wrote.Same-store sales in lower-income stores have been more resilient than those in higher-income stores this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs. (Goldman Sachs)In August, Bank of America released an analysis of its card spending data from the start of the year through July. The data showed higher-income spending had been weaker than lower-income spending on a month-over-month basis for four of the first seven months of the year. BofA attributed part of that divergence to the labor market where higher-income individuals are seeing wages increase at a slower pace while more of the cohort is applying for unemployment benefits.Story continuesInvestors will get another update on consumer spending Thursday with the August retail sales report slated for release.

The last hike of 3.3% to 15.5 cents per share was announced in October 2021. Over the past five years, it increased dividends thrice, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 2.25%.Considering last day’s closing price of $10.87 per share, the company’s current dividend yield is 5.7%. This is impressive compared with the industry’s average of 3.53% and attracts investors as it represents a steady income stream.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Dividend Yield (TTM) Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Dividend Yield (TTM)Huntington Bancshares Incorporated dividend-yield-ttm | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteHBAN also has a steady share repurchase program in place. In January 2023, the company’s board authorized the repurchase of common shares worth $1 billion till Dec 31, 2024.However, it did not repurchase shares under the current authorization in the first half of 2023. Also, management does not expect to utilize this program in the current year as part of its 2023 plan to improve its capital position.As of Jun 30, 2023, Huntington had cash and due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits at Federal Reserve Bank of $11.08 billion and total debt (comprising of long-term debt and short-term borrowings) of $16.39 billion. The company’s largest source of liquidity is core deposits, a source of stable funding. Core deposits were $142.9 billion at June 2023-end and comprised 97% of the total deposits. Given its decent liquidity, dividend payments seem sustainable.Story continuesHuntington, one of the top 30 bank holding companies in the United States, remains focused on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise. The company’s total deposits saw a four-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.6% in 2022. The rising trend continued in the first half of 2023.The company’s loan balance rose in 2022, seeing a four-year CAGR of 16.6%. The uptrend continued in the first half of 2023. Given the strength in loans and deposits, the balance sheet is poised to grow. Management expects average loans to grow 5-6% in 2023, while average deposits are expected to increase 1-3%.With expectations of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates high in the near term, Huntington’s net interest income (NII) and the yield on interest-earning assets are expected to witness decent growth. The company projects 2023 NII (excluding Paycheck Protection Program or PPP and Purchase Accounting Accretion) to grow 3-5%, aided by higher earning assets.On the flipside, weak mortgage business due to higher rates is expected to ail fee income in the near term. Further, rising costs may hinder bottom-line growth. Also, loan concentration, comprising 56% of commercial loans in the total loan portfolio, is concerning.Over the past six months, shares of HBAN have lost 2.3% compared with the industry’s fall of 7.4%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research HBAN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And they found that cashing out of slot machines involved handwritten vouchers and long lines at the cashier’s window. Even paying for lunch was a struggle.“They couldn’t take credit cards,” he said. “These are all First World problems, but it was a pretty frustrating morning.”Miller’s annoyance stemmed from an online attack on MGM Resorts International, which disclosed the breach on Monday. The company said in a statement posted on social media that it took “prompt action to protect our systems and data, including shutting down certain systems.” A message on MGM’s website, which lists numbers for concierges at 19 hotels across the country, said the site “is currently unavailable.”A spokesperson said the attack started Sunday night and affected properties companywide. Some slot machines were taken offline, and staff were operating in “manual mode,” the spokesperson said.In an emailed statement later Monday, the company stressed its casino gaming floors were “operational” but said it was working to resolve the outages.The Las Vegas-based company said it has notified law enforcement and began an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts. The FBI in Las Vegas didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Shares of MGM Resorts fell 2.4% in New York on Monday.It wasn’t immediately clear who was behind the attack, and many details of the breach weren’t known.A receptionist who answered the phone at Mandalay Bay, an MGM resort in Las Vegas that hosts the annual Black Hat cybersecurity conference, said guests had been unable to check in for a short time earlier in the day because the hotel couldn’t get into its system. They were now able to check in, said the employee, who declined to provide his name.Story continuesSeveral accounts on the social media platform X provided further details of the fallout from the attack, though the reports couldn’t immediately be substantiated.One, attributed to John Brennan at the handle @qpr01, said he was in the Borgata casino. “All computer systems are down. Slots will not accept tickets, and anyone trying to cash out is getting the Handpay message regardless of amount,” he said in his post on X.A receptionist who answered the phone at the Borgata confirmed his account, saying she was told when she got into work at 4 p.m. Monday that the office internet had gone down around four hours earlier.“The system is still down,” she said on Monday evening, adding that slot machines were only taking cash as a result. She said most guests were understanding but that “a couple are angry.”Miller, who is from New York City, said the first clue that there was a problem happened on Sunday, when he and his wife used the MGM app for pre-check-in. Normally, he said, they would receive a digital key, but that didn’t happen, so they checked in manually when they arrived in Atlantic City.The next day, Starbucks and other food establishments wouldn’t accept credit cards, and slot machines wouldn’t take pay vouchers, which they spit out to winners to play in other machines or cash out at the window, he said. Casino employees were handwriting vouchers at slot machines, creating long lines at the cashier’s window, he said.Miller said they had checked in under his name on Sunday and went to switch to check in again on Monday under his wife’s name, but temporarily couldn’t because the systems were down. They finally got into their room about 4:30 p.m. and plan to stay three more nights.“We haven’t seen any charges on our credit card yet,” he said. “I’m assuming we are going to be able to stay.”MGM Resorts was the victim of a July 2019 data breach that exposed the personal information of as many as 10.6 million customers.In 2014, Iran waged a cyberattack against Las Vegas Sands Corp., whose chief executive officer and majority owner at the time, Sheldon Adelson, had made comments a few months before suggesting he would get tough with Iran in negotiations over its nuclear program.The FBI has warned of the rise of threats against both physical and online casinos. Earlier this month, the FBI said a North Korean outfit known as Lazarus Group had hacked Stake.com, an online casino and betting platform, stealing $41 million in virtual currency.The Nevada Gaming Commission, which regulates the casino industry in the state, this year introduced new cybersecurity regulations that require casinos to evaluate hacking risks and protect information systems. The aim was to set forth the importance for gaming operators to take necessary steps to protect their information systems, the commission said.Casinos must also inform the Nevada Gaming Control Board of a cyberattack no later than 72 hours of becoming aware of it.--With assistance from Christopher Palmeri.(Updates with MGM’s statement from the sixth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Sam Bankman-Fried’s Elite Parents Enabled His Crypto EmpireADHD Drug Shortages Worsen as Makers Say Production Is Maxed OutGoodbye, California.

According to the latest data from MetLife’s Employee Benefit Trends Study, 76% of workers who understand their benefits are happy and 82% believe their benefits give them a greater sense of overall stability—versus only 47% and 52%, respectively, who don’t.This comes as employees say ""being happy"" is the most important aspect of their work experience (73%), followed by doing meaningful work and being successful. As the workforce transitions into the era of ""The Big Stay""—with 77% of employees now saying they intend to be with their employer in a year—the research indicates employees may increasingly become more intentional about their benefits selection at open enrollment as a means of improving their overall job satisfaction.""Employee benefits play a massive role in employees’ lives both at and outside of work—and a big part of this is not just the benefits themselves, but also the awareness of how they are used,"" said Jamie Madden, senior vice president of Workforce Engagement and Benefits Connectivity at MetLife. ""Understanding benefits leads to more informed open enrollment decisions, better utilization, and a happier, more stable, and generally more satisfied workforce.""Overcoming Enrollment BarriersDespite the positive impact benefits have on employees, the research identified several barriers that frequently hinder comprehension:Education: 62% of employees say understanding how to use their benefits would give them a greater sense of overall stability while 50% say having a better understanding of their benefits—what’s offered and what’s covered—would make them more loyal.Procrastination: Nearly one-third of employees (31%) procrastinated when selecting their benefits last year and 37% wish they’d had more time to make the right choices. This comes as one in six employees regret their benefits elections from last year.Consultation: Nearly half of employees (44%) didn’t consult others before enrolling in benefits last year. This group was also less likely to fully understand their benefits and more likely to worry about unexpected health and financial issues.Story continuesHowever, the research found that when employees take the time to understand and engage in conversations about benefits, they increase their comprehension, make more informed decisions, reduce anxiety, and improve their happiness in stride.Enabling an Engaged and Loyal WorkforceEmployers can help their workforce make more confident open enrollment decisions by using multiple channels and incorporating personalization into benefit communications strategies. For employers, this yields not only a happier, healthier, and more engaged workforce, but also a more loyal one: 50% of employees say having a better understanding of their benefits would make them more loyal to their employer.""With two-thirds of today’s workforce saying open enrollment is more important this year given the current economic situation, it’s critical that employers take steps to empower their employees to make more confident open enrollment decisions and ultimately, have a happier experience at work,"" said Madden.To learn more about open enrollment and access MetLife resources, visit https://www.metlife.com/open-enrollment/Research MethodologyWave 2 of MetLife’s 21st Annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study was conducted in July 2023 and was fielded by Rainmakers CSI – a global strategy, insight and planning consultancy.

One ultra-low sulfur diesel cargo was a split delivery to three locations and another was imported into the Everglades terminal in Fort Lauderdale, the data showed.A 50,000-barrel cargo of diesel exported from Chevron's Nigeria gas-to-liquids plant is also en route from the Escravos plant in Nigeria to New York Harbor this month, traders said and shipping data showed.Besides Canadian imports, those are the first foreign diesel cargoes imported into the U.S. East Coast for four months.The U.S. normally receives diesel cargoes from other countries such as India and Qatar during high demand autumn months to stockpile for winter, which is why it is so unusual for so few imports to be arriving days before major refiners are set to be turning off distillate producing units, Smith added.The northeast will need to secure even more supplies from elsewhere, Kpler's Smith said.LOWEST STOCKPILES IN THE COUNTRYLow feedstock supply and refinery outages have hit distillate stocks across the U.S. East Coast distillate stocks stood at 28.9 million barrels as of Sept. 1, less than 8 million barrels above the record low hit last year, according to the EIA.Northeast distillate inventories were 33% below their five-year seasonal average as of Aug. 25, while the West Coast and Gulf Coast were 28% and 6% below their historical levels, respectively. Midwest stocks were up 2%.Reflecting that tightness, spot market spreads between distillate and crude oil in New York Harbor are likely to surpass their record highs set in 2022, which topped $120 per barrel according to energy economist Philip Verleger.Shippers have also increased distillate volumes on the Colonial Pipeline, which moves fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast refining hub to New York Harbor, traders said, but declined to say by how much.U.S. Gulf Coast exporters have seen the economics for selling to Europe weaken, making the East Coast market look more attractive, according to Sparta Commodities analyst James Noel-Beswick.Record Russian fuel supplies to Latin America are also eating into U.S. Gulf refinery export markets, traders and shipping data show, potentially freeing up more fuel within the U.S.(Reporting by Laura Sanicola, Additional reporting by Shariq Khan Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

(ATSI), a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), has begun upgrading four miles of a high-voltage transmission power line in Portage County, Ohio, a project that will strengthen the regional transmission system and enhance service reliability for nearly 2,000 Ohio Edison customers.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The four miles of 69-kilovolt power line run from the West Ravenna substation to the Ravenna Substation, through Ravenna and Franklin townships. ATSI will replace the existing wires, hardware and structures with new steel poles, wires and equipment and will also enhance equipment at both substations.The new wires can carry more electrical load and will be able to accommodate greater customer demand. They will also be able to carry increased power flow in the event of unplanned service interruptions on other lines in the area. The project will enhance reliability for 1,900 Ohio Edison customers served by the Ravenna Substation and is on track to be completed by early 2024.The project is part of Energizing the Future, a multi-year initiative designed to upgrade FirstEnergy's transmission system with advanced equipment and technologies that will reinforce the power grid and help reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Since 2014, FirstEnergy has upgraded or replaced existing power lines, incorporated smart technology into the grid and upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features.

When the projects are complete, the ash will instead be ground into smaller pieces and fall onto conveyor belts for removal. The new process will create less wastewater, which must undergo careful treatment before it can be safely discharged back into the river to ensure the protection of aquatic ecosystems.""Moving the ash in a mechanical manner will reduce the amount of water that touches ash and then therefore needs to be processed at each plant,"" said Adam Hoalcraft, a consulting engineer at Harrison Power Station. ""The project aligns with FirstEnergy's mission to protect and preserve the natural environment and to promote a sustainable future for the customers and communities we serve.""The upgrades include construction of conveyor belts that will transport coal ash to a new three-sided concrete structure on each plant's grounds. From there, the dry ash will be loaded into trucks to be taken to the companies' existing licensed disposal site nearby. The companies plan to finish the projects by the end of 2025.Story continuesThe Public Service Commission of West Virginia approved the projects in 2022 as part of a $142 million, multi-year environmental compliance program. The cost of the improvements is to be funded through a customer surcharge that will begin next year when the first project is completed.The upgrades support the continued operation of Fort Martin and Harrison until their anticipated retirement dates of 2035 and 2040, respectively. The two plants generate 3,080 megawatts of power combined.Mon Power serves about 395,000 customers in 34 West Virginia counties.

A trusted AI platform for customer companies, the Einstein 1 Platform gives companies the ability to safely connect any data to build AI-powered apps with low-code and deliver entirely new CRM experiences.""A company’s AI strategy is only as good as its data strategy,"" said Parker Harris, Co-Founder and CTO, Salesforce. ""We pioneered the metadata framework nearly 25 years ago to seamlessly bridge data across applications. It's the connective tissue that fuels innovation. Now, with Data Cloud and Einstein AI native on the Einstein 1 Platform, companies can easily create AI-powered apps and workflows that supercharge productivity, reduce costs, and deliver amazing customer experiences.""Why it matters: Customer data is highly fragmented. On average, organizations use 1,061 different applications, yet only 29% of them are integrated. Enterprise data stacks have grown more complex, and prior computing revolutions – cloud, social, and mobile – have generated massive, siloed islands of customer data.Salesforce’s original metadata framework helps companies organize and understand data across Salesforce applications – the equivalent of having a common language so different applications built on the core platform can communicate with each other. It now creates a unified view of the data across an enterprise regardless of how that data is structured in disparate systems by mapping it to the Salesforce metadata framework.Story continuesThis allows organizations to customize every user experience and action their data using a variety of low-code platform services – including Einstein for AI predictions and content generation; Flow for automation; and Lightning for user interfaces. These customizations are instantly available to the rest of the organization’s core applications without having to write costly and brittle integration code.Additionally, Salesforce delivers automatic upgrades three times per year, and the metadata framework prevents any integrations, customizations, or security models from breaking. Organizations can easily add, extend, and build on top of Salesforce as the platform evolves.Einstein 1 Data Cloud Supports Big Data Scale and High Speed Automation to Power a New Wave of Data-Driven AI ApplicationsData Cloud – Salesforce’s real-time hyperscale data engine – unifies and harmonizes customer data, enterprise content, telemetry data, Slack conversations, and other structured and unstructured data to create a single view of the customer. The platform is already processing 30 trillion transactions per month, and connecting and unifying 100 billion records every day.With the new Data Cloud now natively integrated with the Einstein 1 Platform, companies can unlock siloed data in entirely new ways; create rich, unified customer profiles; and deliver entirely new CRM experiences.Data at Scale: The Einstein 1 Platform has expanded to support thousands of metadata-enabled objects per customer, each capable of having trillions of rows. In addition, Marketing Cloud and Commerce Cloud, consumer-scale technology stacks that joined Salesforce’s Customer 360 portfolio via acquisitions, have been re-engineered onto the Einstein 1 Platform.Automation at Scale: Now massive volumes of data can be brought into the Einstein 1 Platform from other systems and immediately made available as actionable Salesforce objects. Flows can be triggered by any change on any object at scale, whether it’s an event coming from an IOT device, a computed insight, or an AI prediction – up to 20,000 events per second – and can interact with any system in the enterprise, including legacy systems, through MuleSoft.Analytics at Scale: Salesforce offers a variety of insights and analytics solutions for different use cases — including Reports and Dashboards, Tableau, CRM Analytics, and Marketing Cloud Reports. With the Einstein 1 Platform’s common metadata schema and access model, all of these solutions can work on the same data at scale — providing rich insights for any use case.Salesforce also announced that every customer with Enterprise Edition or above can now get started with Data Cloud at no cost. Customers can start ingesting, harmonizing, and exploring their data with Data Cloud and Tableau to extend the power of their data across every line of business and jumpstart their AI journey.Einstein Delivers a Generative AI-powered Conversational Assistant – Baked Seamlessly Into the Flow of Work To Drive Significant Productivity GainsSalesforce’s next generation of Einstein brings a conversational AI assistant to every CRM application and customer experience, including:Einstein Copilot: A new and trusted out-of-the-box conversational AI assistant built into the user experience of every Salesforce application. Einstein Copilot will drive productivity by assisting users within their flow of work, enabling them to ask questions in natural language, and receive relevant and trustworthy answers that are grounded in secure proprietary company data from Data Cloud. In addition, Einstein Copilot proactively takes actions and offers additional options beyond the user’s query – such as providing a recommended action plan after a sales call, checking a consumer’s order status, or changing the shipping date.Einstein Copilot Studio: An easy new way for companies to build an entirely new generation of AI-powered apps with custom prompts, skills, and AI models to close sales deals faster, streamline customer service, auto-create websites based on personalized browsing history, or turn natural language prompts into code, as well as hundreds of other business tasks. Einstein Copilot Studio also provides configurability to make Einstein Copilot available for use across consumer-facing channels like websites to power real-time chat, or integrate with messaging platforms like Slack, WhatsApp, or SMS.Einstein Copilot and Einstein Copilot Studio will operate within the Einstein Trust Layer, a secure AI architecture built natively into the Einstein 1 Platform that allows teams to benefit from generative AI, while preserving their company’s data privacy and security standards.The Einstein 1 Platform’s metadata framework offers a fast, trusted path to AI by enabling a flexible, dynamic, and context-rich environment for machine learning algorithms to operate within. Since metadata describes the structure, relationships, and behaviors of data in the system, AI models can better understand the context of customer interactions, business processes, and the outcomes of certain interactions. And, those outcomes can then be used to further fine-tune large language models to deliver results that continually improve over time.Customer Stories""FedEx is data-rich as our global transportation network continues to expand.

This partnership will deliver new bidirectional integrations that allow customers to bring together context from Salesforce and Google Workspace, including Google Calendar, Docs, Meet, Gmail, and more, to power generative AI experiences across platforms.With these integrations, users will be able to seamlessly work across platforms through Salesforce and Google Workspace's generative AI assistants, Salesforce’s Einstein Copilot, and Duet AI in Google Workspace. Customers can use their own account, contact, and opportunity data from Salesforce to generate customized Google Slides and Docs while Google Meet summaries and context from Gmail and Google Calendar can be brought into Salesforce to update records and trigger workflows, such as saving a signed contract to Salesforce and closing the opportunity with a win-loss report generated in Docs.As part of this collaboration, Salesforce and Google have worked together to make their generative AI assistant offerings extensible and each will be the first partners to integrate with the other's newly available third-party platforms.Story continuesSignificance: Generative AI is reshaping the way businesses and people work. In fact, 77% of senior IT leaders say generative AI will help their organization serve customers faster, and 64% of businesses expect AI to increase their workforces’ productivity.This expanded partnership will help drive increased productivity by providing the right data and context at the right time, and unlocking generative AI benefits in the flow of work. With this integration, users will be able to:Generate personalized content across Google Workspace and Salesforce: Users will be able to generate personalized and contextual Workspace content, including emails in Gmail, content in Google Docs, and more, from Workspace or Salesforce, by seamlessly accessing relevant Salesforce information on prior meetings, customer interactions, and sales outcomes.Keep Salesforce records up-to-date with context from Google Workspace: Users will be able to leverage Google Workspace data to automatically keep Salesforce records up-to-date, increasing productivity and eliminating manual tasks—like moving an opportunity stage forward in Salesforce based on context from Gmail.Drive automation at scale: Users will be able to automate processes and eliminate the need for context switching by automatically generating interaction and meeting summaries, scheduling follow-ups and assigning tasks, and more, based on context from Salesforce and Google Workspace. For example, after a successful sales call, a summary from Google Meet can trigger assignment of tasks to owners in Salesforce, schedule follow-up meetings in Google Calendar, and move a deal stage to closed.Go deeper: Salesforce is the first partner to integrate with Google Workspace’s new Duet AI extensions framework and Google Workspace is the first extensibility partner for Salesforce’s new Einstein Copilot. Einstein Copilot will be able to access relevant context in Google Workspace to enrich workflows across sales, service, marketing, commerce, and more. Each of these integrations are backed by the robust privacy and user data protections already in place across Salesforce and Google Workspace.Broader AI Momentum: In addition to Google Workspace integrating with Einstein Copilot, today Google and Salesforce announce the ability for customers to bring their LLMs deployed on Vertex AI, including Google's PaLM family of models, and use them within the Einstein 1 Platform to build generative AI powered experiences across the Customer 360. This continued momentum around Data and AI builds upon partnerships announced earlier this year between Salesforce Data Cloud, Google BigQuery, and Google Vertex AI to help businesses utilize data and AI to deliver more holistic customer data strategy and drive personalized customer experiences.The Google perspective: ""Our partnership with Salesforce is an example of why an open and extensible ecosystem for generative AI will create the most value for customers. Together, Salesforce and Google Workspace will empower organizations to redefine how work is accomplished with generative AI, help foster innovation and productivity at scale, and make common tasks more efficient and purposeful."" – Thomas Kurian, CEO at Google CloudThe Salesforce perspective: ""Our partnership with Google empowers organizations to unlock the full potential of AI and data, grounded in trust.

Einstein now includes:Einstein Copilot: A new and trusted out-of-the-box conversational AI assistant built into the user experience of every Salesforce application. Einstein Copilot will drive productivity by assisting users within their flow of work, enabling them to ask questions in natural language, and receive relevant and trustworthy answers that are grounded in secure proprietary company data from Salesforce Data Cloud. In addition, Einstein Copilot proactively offers options for additional actions beyond the user’s query – such as a recommended action plan after a sales call, or creating a new service knowledge article.Einstein Copilot Studio: An easy new way for companies to build an entirely new generation of AI-powered apps with custom prompts, skills, and AI models to close sales deals faster, streamline customer service, auto-create websites based on personalized browsing history, or turn natural language prompts into code, as well as hundreds of other business tasks. Einstein Copilot Studio also provides configurability to make Einstein Copilot available for use across other consumer-facing channels like websites to power real-time chat, Slack, WhatsApp, or SMS.Coming in pilot this fall, Einstein Copilot and Einstein Copilot Studio will operate within the Einstein Trust Layer, a secure AI architecture natively built into Salesforce that allows teams to generate higher-quality AI results by grounding responses with customer data, while preserving their company’s data privacy and security standards.Story continuesWhy it matters: 45% of executives are increasing AI investments and early adopters are already reaping the benefits, freeing over 30% of employee time to drive revenue growth, cut costs, and deliver high-quality customer experiences and interactions. Salesforce's new advancements put AI to work for millions of CRM users, and are fundamentally reshaping how people build and interact with business applications to achieve higher performance and job satisfaction.""The reality is every company will undergo an AI transformation to increase productivity, drive efficiency, and deliver incredible customer and employee experiences,"" said Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce. ""With Einstein Copilot and Data Cloud we’re making it easy to create powerful AI assistants and infuse trusted AI into the flow of work across every job, business, and industry. In this new world, everyone can now be an Einstein.""Einstein Copilot in Action: A Conversational AI Assistant Driving Massive Productivity GainsEinstein Copilot will generate trusted and accurate recommendations and content to accomplish specific tasks like building digital storefronts, drafting custom code, creating data visualizations, or providing sales associates with recommended steps to close deals fast. It is securely grounded with customer data from Salesforce Data Cloud, including customer data, enterprise content, telemetry data, Slack conversations, and other structured and unstructured data to ensure that Einstein Copilot makes well-informed and accurate decisions.Before Einstein Copilot, other generative AI copilot solutions had to be run as separate applications that were not integrated within the flow of work, and could not easily or securely use trusted company data to generate relevant or consistent results from large language models. Einstein Copilot will be natively integrated within the world’s #1 AI CRM, and tap into data from any Salesforce application to generate more accurate AI-powered recommendations and content.Using natural language prompts, Einstein Copilot will complete any of the following tasks, and more:Sales: Research accounts, prep for meetings, and automatically update account information in Salesforce. Automatically summarize highlights, surface customer sentiment, and extract next steps from video calls. Explore and search for specific details in customer calls rather than reading through transcripts. Auto-generate sales emails to fit tone and style and align to customer context. Automatically draft clauses and embed them directly within customer contracts.Service: Automatically respond to customers with personalized, relevant answers grounded in trusted company knowledge, across any preferred channel including email, SMS, live chat, or social media. Empower service teams to resolve customer issues faster using generative answers, seamlessly integrated into their flow of work, and autonomously compete tasks like auto-summarizing intricate support cases and field work orders.Marketing: Automatically generate email copy for marketing campaigns. Create smarter campaign segmentation with Data Cloud. Create website landing pages based on personalized consumer browsing and buying preferences. Create contact forms that automatically populate each customer’s unified profile in Salesforce. And automatically generate surveys following online actions to increase long-term engagement and purchasing.Commerce: Provide step-by-step assistance to build high-converting digital storefronts. Automate complex tasks like managing multi-product catalog data. Create product descriptions in multiple languages, personalized product promotions, and SEO metadata generation that drive conversions. Customize and design storefront components with natural language prompts.Developers: Turn natural language prompts into Apex code, suggest more effective and accurate code, and proactively scan for code vulnerabilities – all from within the developer environment.Tableau: Quickly go from raw data to actionable insights in a conversational interface. Increase data analyst productivity with a natural language assistant to perform faster data exploration, build relevant visualizations based on best practices, automate repetitive tasks, and promote efficient data curation.Industry-specific: Einstein Copilot assists industry professionalsA financial advisor can analyze client spending and savings history to offer personalized coaching and create tailored plans and goals.A healthcare administrator can automatically reduce patient scheduling no-shows and generate appointment summaries.An automotive service provider can glean predictive insights from vehicle data and proactively schedule service.A college administrator can personalize the student experience by more efficiently mapping relevant individual skills and interests to specific courses that improve workforce readiness.Introducing Einstein Copilot Studio: Build and Customize a Trusted AI AssistantCompanies that want to customize Einstein Copilot will use the new Einstein Copilot Studio to build and tailor AI assistants with relevant prompts, skills, and AI models to accomplish specific sales, service, marketing, commerce, and IT tasks.Companies will not only be able to use Einstein Copilot within Salesforce applications, but also across consumer-facing channels. This will enhance customer interactions by embedding AI assistants into websites to power real-time chat, or integrating with messaging platforms like Slack, WhatsApp, or SMS.Einstein Copilot Studio will include:Prompt Builder: Prompt Builder will let users build, test, and deploy generative AI prompts that match their company’s brand and communication style, all without requiring deep technical expertise. For example, a marketer could ask Prompt Builder to generate a personalized message and discount for a new product based on the customer's purchase history and location. Einstein Copilot will then auto-generate personalized messages that align with individual customer preferences, reference past purchases, and demographic information. Unlike other prompt engineering tools that require integration and specific skills, Prompt Builder will be a low-code experience that rapidly delivers grounded prompts across any CRM app or workflow, with the Einstein Trust Layer included.Skills Builder: Skills Builder will enable companies to create custom AI-driven actions that complete specific tasks. For example, with Skills Builder, a company will be able to create a ""Competitor Analysis"" skill for meeting preparation. This skill will analyze current market data, sales figures, and send API calls to external databases, resulting in a comprehensive competitor overview. As the meeting date approaches, the sales rep simply prompts the Einstein Copilot, which then swiftly picks the ""Competitor Analysis"" skill to provide crucial insights and talking points.Model Builder: Companies require the flexibility to select their own AI models (BYOM) for their specific business needs. Model Builder will let customers select one of Salesforce's proprietary LLMs, or seamlessly integrate preferred predictive and generative partner AI models, and train or fine-tune them on data in Data Cloud without moving or copying data. This will equip Einstein Copilot with more accurate insights and content tailored to unique employee or customer dynamics. Model Builder will support ""bring your own model"" integrations with Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, Google Cloud's Vertex AI, and OpenAI.The Einstein Trust LayerThe Einstein Trust Layer is a secure AI architecture, natively built into the Salesforce Platform. Designed for enterprise security standards, the Einstein Trust Layer allows teams to benefit from generative AI without compromising their customer data, while at the same time letting companies use their trusted data to improve generative AI responses:Integrated and grounded: Built into every Einstein Copilot by default, the Trust Layer grounds and enriches generative prompts in trusted company data through an integration with Salesforce Data Cloud.Zero-data retention and PII protection: Companies can be confident their data will never be retained by third-party LLM providers, and customer personal identifiable information (PII) masking delivers added data privacy.Toxicity awareness and compliance-ready AI monitoring: A safety-detector LLM will guard against toxicity and risks to brands by ""scoring"" AI generations to provide confidence that responses are safe. Additionally, every AI interaction will be captured in a secure, monitored audit trail, giving companies visibility and control of how their data is being used.Customer Stories:""Our teams have spent the past five years transforming our digital architecture and this next chapter of our journey has a clear focus on generative AI to assist our employees in being efficient and cost-effective. We see a ton of value in implementing Salesforce's conversational AI assistants across our entire business to drive greater customer engagement, and help every employee make better decisions that drive our organization forward."" – Shohreh Abedi, EVP, Chief Operations Technology Officer, and Member Experience at AAA - The Auto Club Group""Heathrow Airport uses digital technologies to create personalized experiences that increase customer engagement and revenue.

54,75ab08ff-6c47-3ac7-af09-e6ead941cbc1,FLS,2023-09-12,Here's Why 3M (MMM) Stock Should Grace Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-3m-mmm-stock-163300169.html,1694449980,STORY,"['MMM', 'FLS', 'GHM']","[3M Company MMM is poised for growth on the back of its cost-control actions, portfolio reshaping actions and improving supply chains.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that make investing in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a smart choice now.Business Strength: Within the Safety and Industrial unit, strength in the automotive aftermarket business bodes well for 3M. Growth in the auto OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) business should aid the Transportation and Electronics segment. Organic sales growth in the medical solutions and oral care business is benefiting the Healthcare segment, while muted growth in home, health and auto care should aid the Consumer unit. With improving supply chains, the company anticipates improvements in organic growth, operating margins, earnings and cash flow in due course of the year.Restructuring Actions: 3M is undertaking restructuring actions to reduce costs and improve margins and cash flow in the long term. The organizational restructuring has impacted approximately 6,000 positions globally. This is in addition to the reduction of 2,500 global manufacturing roles announced this January. MMM expects these actions to yield annual pre-tax savings of $700 million-$900 million, approximately half of which is expected to be realized in 2023. The company’s pricing actions (to mitigate the adverse impact of raw material and logistics cost inflation), restructuring savings and spending discipline should support its margins.Rewards to Shareholders: 3M is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first half of 2023, MMM rewarded its shareholders with $1,655 million in dividend payments and $29 million in buybacks. Strong free cash flow generation supports its shareholder-friendly measures. Adjusted free cash flow at the end of the second quarter was $2409 million, up 35.3% year over year. The company anticipates an adjusted operating cash flow of $5.9-$6.3 billion for 2023. In February 2023, MMM hiked its quarterly dividend by 0.7% to $1.50 per share.Story continues3M Company Price and Consensus3M Company Price and Consensus3M Company price-consensus-chart | 3M Company QuotePortfolio Reshaping Actions: 3M’s portfolio reshaping actions are expected to enhance its shareholder value over time. In August, the company sold certain assets from its dental local anesthetic portfolio (formerly part of the dental materials business within the Oral Care Solutions division) to Pierrel. The divestment will help 3M divert resources to the Health Care business' core Oral Care technologies. In October 2022, MMM completed the sale of its Neoplast and Neobun brands to Selic Corp. The company also divested the manufacturing assets of its Ladlumkaew, Thailand, facility to Selic Corp.Northbound Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 3M’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 3.5% in the past 60 days.Other Stocks to ConsiderBelow we discuss some other stocks worth considering within the Industrial Products sector:Flowserve Corporation FLS presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

57,073285ad-4a3c-3af5-8e17-c9149aad8dd7,PCG,2023-09-12,PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-nyse-pcg-reinvesting-125213464.html,1694436733,STORY,['PCG'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for PG&amp;E:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.027 = US$2.9b ÷ (US$121b - US$13b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, PG&amp;E has an ROCE of 2.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.5%. Check out our latest analysis for PG&amp;E roceIn the above chart we have measured PG&amp;E's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PG&amp;E here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For PG&amp;E Tell Us?In terms of PG&amp;E's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 2.7% from 4.8% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Our Take On PG&amp;E's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by PG&amp;E's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 64% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think PG&amp;E has the makings of a multi-bagger.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for PG&amp;E   (of which 2 are significant!) that you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $4.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Marathon Oil shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Marathon Oil is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 56 cents per share to 59 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Marathon Oil right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

63,91aa13c2-ff6e-3729-a7b5-4ac3c633ef7f,MRO,2023-09-12,"With 78% institutional ownership, Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/78-institutional-ownership-marathon-oil-122402544.html,1694435042,STORY,['MRO'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Marathon Oil's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Marathon Oil, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marathon Oil?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Marathon Oil. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Marathon Oil's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Marathon Oil is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.2% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 6.8% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Marathon OilThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Marathon Oil Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$38m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Marathon Oil. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Marathon Oil better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Marathon Oil (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

VZ recently hiked its quarterly dividend payout by about 2% to 66.50 cents per share or $2.66 on an annualized basis. This portrays the company’s solid balance sheet position on the back of a faster 5G rollout across the country and healthy fixed wireless broadband momentum.Based on the closing price of $33.45 as of Sep 8, the proposed dividend affirms a yield of 7.95%. A steady dividend payout is part of VZ’s long-term strategy to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. Additionally, healthy dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of its key strengths.This is the 17th consecutive year the company has increased its quarterly dividend. The current hike reflects its inherent financial strength and strong cash flow generated from continued focus on high-margin businesses and healthy execution of operating plans. Verizon has a dividend payout rate of 52.8%. The rate has increased steadily over the past few quarters, indicating that the company is sharing more of its earnings with stockholders.To boost its liquidity, Verizon has been looking to slash costs through employee reduction, active management of near-term maturities, optimization of overall funding footprint and lowering the cost of capital. It currently has a debt-to-capital ratio of 0.61 compared with 0.57 of the sub-industry.Verizon is likely to benefit from a disciplined network strategy backed by a customer-centric business model and diligent execution of operational plans. In addition, the company is focused on making necessary capital expenditures to support the increased demand for network traffic. The continued build-out of OneFiber and C-Band spectrum expansion will expand the reach and capacity of its 5G Ultra Wideband network.Verizon is offering various mix-and-match pricing in wireless and home broadband plans, which has led to solid customer additions with increased adoption of 5G devices and premium unlimited plans. Moreover, in the enterprise and wholesale business, Verizon is changing its revenue mix toward newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services.The company has further expanded Fios Forward to support digital inclusion and provide opportunities for underserved households to thrive in the digital world. With no data caps, Fios customers can experience faster upload and download than comparable plans. The company’s focus on online content delivery, mobile video and online advertising should drive growth.The stock has lost 21.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 15.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The sources said it has not launched a formal investigation, suggesting it may be waiting for a CMA decision before making any move.It was not clear which companies were asked for their comments. Companies typically prefer not to disclose dealings with the Commission because of the sensitive nature of its investigations.An EU investigation looks unlikely, other sources said, citing the structuring of Microsoft's CMA proposal to ensure compliance with its EU remedies.The Commission declined to comment on the email, reiterating that it was following developments in the UK closely and assessing any potential impact on its own case.(Reporting by Foo Yun CheeEditing by Jason Neely and David Goodman)]"

While the company avoided being broken up in the legal battle, which centred around its dominance of the PC market, the years of litigation have been cited as a key reason why the company missed out on a new generation of technology such as internet search, social media and smartphones.This week, starting on Tuesday, a courtroom in Washington DC will host the biggest tech monopoly case since the US government came close to breaking up Microsoft a quarter of a century ago. Its subject is Google, one of the companies that took the innovation crown from Gates’ business.Bill Gates' reputation took a hit in the late 1990s after a recording of his deposition in a monopoly court case were made public - JESSICA PERSSON/AFP via Getty ImagesWhy is Google on trial?Google is being sued by the US Justice Department under the same 19th century law used to go after Microsoft, and is accused of using similar tactics. In this case, prosecutors allege that the company used a web of illegal deals to freeze out competitors to its search engine, cementing its own vice-like grip over the web.The agency is seeking an order forcing Google to stop its behaviour, but a judge could go as far as a breakup of the company.Like Microsoft at the turn of the millennium, Google is also reckoning with a changing tide in the tech industry. For the first time in decades, its search engine is under threat, not from a traditional competitor, but from artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT that could replace the cascade of links that Google’s search engine offers with concise and precise answers.Story continuesThe US case against Google is the culmination of more than a decade of growing regulatory pressure against the company, which last week celebrated its 25th birthday.The European Union has repeatedly fined Google billions of euros and ordered it to make changes to its constellation of services, from price comparison to its Android phone software and internet advertising business.The UK’s competition regulator has launched multiple investigations into the company, and forced it to make changes to its web browser.The US case was first launched almost three years ago under the Trump administration but has been taken forward by Biden’s Justice Department. The case gets to the gravitational centre of the company’s power: its all-conquering search engine.How did Google break antitrust laws?The Justice Department argues that Google’s dominance – accounting for nine in 10 search queries in the US – is not the result of having the best search engine, but the consequence of a series of exclusivity agreements signed with phone manufacturers and software makers that made it the primary search engine for almost all consumers and froze out potential rivals.“It’s not about the tech anymore, it’s about the moat they put around themselves,” says Colin Hayhurst, who runs the British search engine Mojeek. “It’s the fact they have these agreements with the other big players.”In particular, the Justice Department’s case zeroes in on a deal with Apple to be the iPhone browser’s default search engine, a contract believed to be worth up to $15bn (£12bn) a year.According to the complaint, one Apple employee told their Google counterpart: “Our vision is that we work as if we are one company.”The regulatory focus on Google's search prevalence on iPhones has drawn in deputies of Apple boss Tim Cook - Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesApple has produced more than on million pages of evidence to prosecutors. Three executives, all of whom report directly to chief executive Tim Cook, are scheduled to appear in the witness box after the iPhone maker lost an attempt to block legal demands that they testify. (Apple says it makes Google the main search engine on its phones because it considers it to be the best on the market, not because of the billions that flow the other way as a result.)Google’s top lawyer, Kent Walker, has called the case “deeply flawed” and says people use its search engine “because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives”.The trial is scheduled to take just over two months, with a string of high-powered decision makers, including Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai, expected to give evidence.The American government’s chances of success are unclear. The courts have been dealt a series of setbacks to efforts to rein in Big Tech. Regulators’ attempts to block deals such as Microsoft’s purchase of games company Activision Blizzard and Meta’s purchase of virtual reality company Within have been overruled.Last week, a group of US states that had sued Google for breaking monopoly laws with its app store, settled with the company. The terms of the deal were kept private.Google chief Sundar Pichai is expected to give evidence when the US Justice Department's case goes to court - Kyle Grillot/BloombergMaurice Stucke, a former Justice Department prosecutor and law professor at the University of Tennessee, says the outcome of the case is hard to call.“The problem today is that the courts are a moving target and it’s very hard to predict how they will rule,” he says. “There haven’t been many monopolisation cases brought by the agency, the last really was the Microsoft one.”What happens if Google loses the antitrust trial?Even if the Justice Department’s case ultimately fails, it may not matter. The barrage of evidence and testimony will be its own form of punishment. Gary Reback, one of the government lawyers who took on Microsoft in the Nineties, is fond of saying “the trial is the remedy”, meaning the public scrutiny itself is punishment enough.Google’s lawyers have attempted to prevent the case from being broadcast over Zoom, which opponents say is an attempt to suppress the amount of attention it receives.Meanwhile, the distraction of a major court case is also likely to have an impact on day-to-day operations.Former Microsoft executives say its own battle with the US government meant the company became bureaucratic and slow, with every product update having to go through layers of legal reviews before it would be released to the public.Google’s case comes as its search engine faces a growing threat from AI. The company has declared an internal “code red” over the rise of ChatGPT. Engineers have warned that the company has “no moat” against the rise of free, open source models, and many of its AI experts have quit, citing a stuffy culture that impedes innovation.Even if Google wins its battle with the US government, the encounter may do lasting damage.Shivaun Raff, the co-founder of the price comparison service Foundem, who has campaigned against Google in Europe for over a decade, says of the US court battle: “This is the first step. I believe that there’s several arrows in their quiver, but it’s only just getting started.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The computer mogul left long gaps between his answers and said ""I don’t recall"" so many times even the judge laughed. The case ended with the court ruling that Microsoft was indeed a monopoly. The final result was a settlement restricting predatory behavior but not requiring an AT&amp;T-style breakup.Google circa 2023 is very different from Microsoft circa 2004. The introduction of ChatGPT last fall has changed the conversation from whether Google’s search dominance is unassailable to whether it is already in inevitable decline—as Jeremy Kahn’s deep dive earlier this summer, which you should read here, explored. Google’s disruptive moment may be imminent. In comparison to Microsoft, this case seems almost anticlimactic.The trial is scheduled to continue into late November, and another round of court filings and arguments will likely follow. If the judge determines Google has been breaking the law, there will be another trial to determine remedies. All of which underscores the fundamental problem with using antitrust law to regulate the tech industry. The first moves far too slowly to have a meaningful impact on the second, which evolves at warp speed. The best that can be said is that threat of antitrust action forces companies like Microsoft and Google to be more responsible in exercising their market power—which is not a bad outcome.Story continuesMore news below.Alan Murray@alansmurrayalan.murray@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

(AP) — An explosion and fire at a soybean processing facility in Illinois injured eight employees over the weekend and sent a tower of smoke into the air, officials said Monday.The explosion occurred at the east plant in the Archer Daniels Midland processing complex shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday in Decatur, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, the agricultural company said in a statement on its website.Six of the eight injured workers were taken from the scene by ambulance with the “extent of injuries unknown,” Battalion Chief Wade Watson with the Decatur Fire Department said in a statement Monday morning.ADM said in a statement early Monday afternoon that five employees remained in hospitalized “receiving treatment for their injuries” and added that the company's “priority is providing our injured colleagues and their families support.”The explosion was followed by a large plume of dark smoke high above the facility in a video posted by WCIA-TV.The Chicago-based company said the plant where the explosion occurred produces soybean oil and white flake for soybean protein production. That plant is currently idle and ADM's adjacent corn processing plant is “also temporarily down until we can safely resume operations,"" the company said.“The main fire was extinguished overnight, and we are continuing to closely monitor and assess the extent of the damage to the complex as we investigate the cause of the incident,” ADM said.The Decatur Fire Department said a fire crew remains on the scene monitoring hot spots and the cause of the explosion and fire remains under investigation.The explosion is the second episode at the plant in less than a month, the (Decatur) Herald &amp; Review reported.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Synopsys (SNPS) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 15.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 24.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.7%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Synopsys is 25.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.7% over the past month.Bottom LineSynopsys has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Synopsys is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PM, Altria Group, Inc. MO, Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB and 22nd Century Group, Inc. XXII.Industry: TobaccoLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2147034/4-tobacco-stocks-worth-watching-despite-industry-concernsPlayers in the Zacks Tobacco industry have been bearing the brunt of the inflationary environment, which has affected Adult Tobacco Consumers’ (“ATC”) spending patterns. The cost inflation of direct materials has also raised margin concerns for companies in the space.However, pricing power has been a major upside. Strength in the smoke-free product arena as a response to consumers’ changing preferences has also been working well for players. Such upsides keep Philip Morris International Inc., Altria Group, Inc., Turning Point Brands, Inc. and 22nd Century Group, Inc. well-placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products, such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some companies also offer RRPs, such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products.Most products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco IndustrySoft Cigarette Volumes: The overall cigarette industry has been bearing the brunt of the inflationary environment, which has affected ATC spending patterns. As the external landscape remains dynamic, economic factors like elevated inflation, higher interest rates, global supply-chain hurdles and ATC dynamics, such as purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products and disposable income, are likely to have an impact on cigarette volumes.Story continuesFurther, cigarette volumes have been affected by strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. Since cigarette sales account for the majority of revenues for companies in the tobacco industry, dwindling sales volumes in this category are a concern.Cost Inflation: Cost inflation has been hurting the performance of many industry players. Global inflationary headwinds associated with direct materials, tobacco leaf, energy and wages have been a concern. Increased costs associated with smoke-free product research, development and marketplace activities also pose threats to margins.Pricing Power: Players in the tobacco industry have been capitalizing on the robust pricing power of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and soft cigarette sales volumes. Given that smokers are generally undeterred by price increases due to their addiction, this strategy is expected to remain effective for companies operating in the tobacco sector. The high pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues and the operating income of players in the tobacco industry.Smoke-Free Products Gain Prominence: Growing health awareness and stringent government regulations aimed at reducing cigarette smoking have driven many consumers toward low-risk and reduced-risk products (RRPs). These products are promoted as having a less adverse impact on health due to their scientific composition and way of consumption. An increasing number of consumers are turning to these alternatives as a means to quit smoking traditional cigarettes.Major players in the tobacco industry have been allocating resources to expand their presence in this category, including investing in innovations to make these products more user-friendly and energy-efficient. Companies have been experiencing significant revenue growth in the RRP or smoke-free product space.A notable example is the tobacco giant, Philip Morris, which is actively working toward transitioning into a predominantly smoke-free company by 2025. We anticipate that the strength of these products will continue to yield positive results for industry participants as they undergo business transformations toward RRPs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

89,bf522f33-3c1a-3325-8eb4-e24b4b45bce0,PM,2023-09-12,4 Tobacco Stocks Worth Watching Despite Industry Concerns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-tobacco-stocks-worth-watching-134900802.html,1694440140,STORY,"['PM', 'MO', 'TPB', '^GSPC']","[Players in the Zacks Tobacco industry have been bearing the brunt of the inflationary environment, which has affected Adult Tobacco Consumers’ (“ATC”) spending patterns. The cost inflation of direct materials has also raised margin concerns for companies in the space.However, pricing power has been a major upside. Strength in the smoke-free product arena as a response to consumers’ changing preferences has also been working well for players. Such upsides keep Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Altria Group, Inc. MO, Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB and 22nd Century Group, Inc. XXII well-placed.About the Industry The Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products, such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some companies also offer RRPs, such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products. Most products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco IndustrySoft Cigarette Volumes: The overall cigarette industry has been bearing the brunt of the inflationary environment, which has affected ATC spending patterns. As the external landscape remains dynamic, economic factors like elevated inflation, higher interest rates, global supply-chain hurdles and ATC dynamics, such as purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products and disposable income, are likely to have an impact on cigarette volumes. Further, cigarette volumes have been affected by strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. Since cigarette sales account for the majority of revenues for companies in the tobacco industry, dwindling sales volumes in this category are a concern.Cost Inflation: Cost inflation has been hurting the performance of many industry players. Global inflationary headwinds associated with direct materials, tobacco leaf, energy and wages have been a concern. Increased costs associated with smoke-free product research, development and marketplace activities also pose threats to margins.Pricing Power: Players in the tobacco industry have been capitalizing on the robust pricing power of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and soft cigarette sales volumes. Given that smokers are generally undeterred by price increases due to their addiction, this strategy is expected to remain effective for companies operating in the tobacco sector. The high pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues and the operating income of players in the tobacco industry.Smoke-Free Products Gain Prominence: Growing health awareness and stringent government regulations aimed at reducing cigarette smoking have driven many consumers toward low-risk and reduced-risk products (RRPs). These products are promoted as having a less adverse impact on health due to their scientific composition and way of consumption. An increasing number of consumers are turning to these alternatives as a means to quit smoking traditional cigarettes. Major players in the tobacco industry have been allocating resources to expand their presence in this category, including investing in innovations to make these products more user-friendly and energy-efficient. Companies have been experiencing significant revenue growth in the RRP or smoke-free product space. A notable example is the tobacco giant, Philip Morris, which is actively working toward transitioning into a predominantly smoke-free company by 2025. We anticipate that the strength of these products will continue to yield positive results for industry participants as they undergo business transformations toward RRPs.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

93,4882d9c0-81c2-3604-a557-23cd49bdbdf0,HCA,2023-09-12,35 Countries that Need Nurses the Most,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/35-countries-nurses-most-154541178.html,1694447141,STORY,"['ATGE', 'HCA']","[In this article, we will look at the 35 countries that need nurses the most. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of nursing shortages in the US, head straight to the 10 Countries that Need Nurses the Most. Nursing Shortages: A Global ConcernThe International Council of Nurses (ICN) has sounded a global alarm about the critical shortage of nurses with staggering statistics. Drawing on data from over 100 studies, the ICN report reveals that between 40% to 80% of nurses across the world fell victim to psychological distress during the pandemic. This distress, fueled by the pandemic's relentless pressures, eventually led to a surge in nurses' intentions to leave their profession. Moreover, the annual turnover rate in hospitals has soared to more than 10%. This global shortage of nursing staff poses a severe threat to healthcare systems globally. The pandemic has exposed the fragility of these systems, making it clear that immediate and heavy investments are required to support and retain nurses. Failure to act decisively could further plunge the world into a healthcare crisis. Nursing Shortages in the USThe picture of nurse shortages is even darker in the US. As of May 2023, the nursing workforce in the United States continues to grapple with huge challenges, particularly in the face of persistent turnover. A recent survey of 368 frontline nurses revealed that 31% of respondents still express an intent to leave their current direct patient care positions within the next year. This percentage, while showing signs of stabilization, remains considerably higher than the 22 percent reported in February 2021. The impact of this attrition can not be ignored, as the actual hospital and staff RN turnover has been increasing from 18 percent in fiscal year 2020 to 27 percent in fiscal year 2021. Even though turnover reduced to 23 percent in fiscal year 2022, it remains high compared to pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, the RN workforce declined by approximately 100,000 by the end of 2021. While the reasons for leaving the profession vary, 35% of surveyed nurses who intend to leave stated they will remain in direct patient care but with a different employer or role, while others plan to exit the workforce entirely or pursue alternative career paths. To read more about nursing shortages and its impact, check out our article on highest paying countries for nurses. Story continuesIt is worth noting that Denmark is the European country that needs nurses the most. However, European country that pays the highest salaries to nurses is Switzerland with an annual average salary of $105,347. How are Nursing Shortages Being Addressed?To address the challenges of nursing shortages, Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) is employing the Social Determinants of Learning (SDOL) framework. With the US nursing shortage expected to reach hundreds of thousands, Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) recognizes that success in nursing is 70% influenced by psychosocial factors, while only 30% depends on academic abilities. By prioritizing holistic admissions and personalized support, Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) helps students overcome barriers like financial instability and transportation issues. It is also worth noting that Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) is the largest grantor of bachelor of science in nursing degrees to underrepresented minority students in the US, with approximately 38,000 students across 23 campuses and online programs.The success of Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) is not just limited to its social impact, it is also translated into its financials. Adtalem Global Education Inc (NYSE:ATGE) reported total revenue of $1.45 billion for 2022 which is a 5% increase from the previous year. The company's gross profit reached $802.34 million in the same year. On the other hand, HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) is addressing the shortage of nurses through their increased financial investments and innovative initiatives. They have committed over $300 million towards nurse education and training, with $200 million allocated to expanding Galen College of Nursing and approximately $136 million for the establishment of new Centers for Clinical Advancement.Since 2019, HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) has already opened 12 Centers for Clinical Advancement, and they plan to invest an additional $90 million to open 20 more in the next three years. These centers serve as vital training hubs and offer practice-based instruction while utilizing advanced technology like simulation rooms and more than 145 manikins. Due to their unwavering commitment to quality services, HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) also owns most of the best for profit hospitals in the US. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) is also poised for financial growth as Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in its Q2, 2023 investor letter:“The flip side of higher medical utilization trends is that health care providers and medical device companies will benefit. We own HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s largest providers of health care services, with 182 hospitals and 2,300 ambulatory sites of care in 20 states and the U.K. We own several medical device companies that should benefit in the short term from procedure recovery and in the long term from new product innovation and increasing demand driven by an aging global population and a higher disease burden from chronic diseases. For the most part, our investments are in companies addressing non-elective procedures, which makes them less likely to be deferred in a recession.”Minerva Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo rank the countries that need nurses the most, we have relied on the data from WHO about the number of registered nurses per 10,000 people in respective countries. The 35 countries with the lowest number of nurses per 10,000 people have been selected. The list is presented in descending order. Note: In case of similar number of nurses, the country with a higher population has been ranked higher. 35. AustraliaNurses Per 10,000: 150Australia is facing nursing shortages owing to the travel restrictions for overseas nurses, reallocation to COVID-19 efforts, and decreased nursing course enrollments. Nevertheless, recent data indicates a demand for nurses, particularly registered ones. 34. IrelandNurses Per 10,000: 148Nursing in Ireland has problems as there aren't enough nurses, and the ones there are, are overburdened. Moreover, housing is expensive in Ireland which makes it even harder for nurses to pay for with their current salaries. 33. New ZealandNurses Per 10,000: 117Nursing shortages in New Zealand are a critical issue. As the demand for nurses exceeds the available workforce, it does not only affect patient care but also substantially increases the workload on practicing nurses. New Zealand is one of the countries that need nurses the most. 32. DenmarkNurses Per 10,000: 105Denmark is facing a huge nurse shortage as approximately 14% of nurses, around 4,600 individuals, left the Danish public health system within a year. This loss occurred between November 2021 and 2022. The departure rate has been over 10% annually since 2017, which has been increasing by 2.5% since 2020. Denmark is one of the European countries that need nurses the most. 31. CanadaNurses Per 10,000: 100In Ontario, the total number of nurses employed increased from 155,018 in 2022 to 158,430 in 2023. This includes more than 15,000 new nurse registrations this year. However, around 9,000 nurses chose not to renew their registrations. The proportion of actively working nurses decreased from 90.6% in 2020 to 88.9% in 2023, while the proportion of nurses taking leaves or moving out of the province rose from 3.3% in 2016 to 5.8% in 2023. 30. United KingdomNurses Per 10,000: 92Nurse shortages in the UK result from a combination of factors, like increased patient demand, inadequate staffing levels, high turnover, and Brexit-related immigration restrictions. These challenges have strained the healthcare system and made it challenging to recruit and retain qualified nursing professionals. However, owing to the high standard of living in the UK along with high salaries, UK is one of the best countries for nurses to work and live. 29. ParaguayNurses Per 10,000: 90Paraguay is faced with severe healthcare staffing challenges with a serious shortage of healthcare personnel. The primary healthcare system serves only 30% of the population, and the country has limited healthcare resources, particularly in rural areas, with most services concentrated in urban regions.28. United Arab EmiratesNurses Per 10,000: 62The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is projected to experience severe nursing shortages by 2030, and will require over 33,000 additional healthcare workers, including nurses and other healthcare professionals. It is one of the countries to work as a nurse without IELTS. 27. Saudi ArabiaNurses Per 10,000: 56Saudi Arabia requires an additional 175,000 healthcare workers by 2030 to address the healthcare workforce shortages. This includes 69,000 doctors, 64,000 nurses, and 42,000 other health professionals. Saudi Arabia is one of the countries the need nurses the most. 26. ArgentinaNurses Per 10,000: 52Argentina is faced with serious understaffing of nurses, especially in its provinces. With varying densities of nursing personnel in different provinces, this issue undermines healthcare capacity and quality in Argentina. 25. ChileNurses Per 10,000: 46Despite Chile's economic growth and government investments in education and healthcare, a nursing shortage persists due to low salaries and the allure of better-paying careers. While education opportunities have also expanded, many opt for more high paying professions, and as most find nursing less attractive. 24. NepalNurses Per 10,000: 35Nepal has a shortage of nurses because many are leaving for jobs in countries like the UK. This is a problem for Nepal's healthcare system. However, it's also important to know that working conditions for nurses can be tough in these destination countries as well. So, while Nepal has a nurse shortage, it's not always easy for nurses who go abroad to work either.23. Costa RicaNurses Per 10,000: 32Interestingly, in Costa Rica, there is a surplus of newly graduated nurses compared to the available job openings in both public and private healthcare sectors. This means that more nurses are being trained than there are positions available for them to work. However, it's important to note that even with this surplus, Costa Rica still has a lower number of nurses per population when compared to the average in countries belonging to the OECD.22. PeruNurses Per 10,000: 26Nurse shortages in Peru can be attributed to low wages, inadequate working conditions, and a lack of educational opportunities for nurses. These challenges have led to difficulties in recruiting and retaining nursing professionals. Peru is one of the countries that need nurses the most. 21. Sri LankaNurses Per 10,000: 25In Sri Lanka, the nursing shortage has a direct impact on patient care quality and nurses' job satisfaction. A study conducted at Polonnaruwa District General Hospital found a positive correlation between nurse shortage and workload. Workload, in turn, significantly affects patient care quality. However, the study also highlighted the role of emotional intelligence in moderating nurses' job outcomes, helping them manage stress in their duties.20. BhutanNurses Per 10,000: 22Bhutan has a serious shortage of nurses, with a density of nursing and midwifery personnel at just 2.1 per thousand population in 2020. This shortage poses huge challenges to the country's healthcare system.19. LiberiaNurses Per 10,000: 19While Liberia faces a critical shortage of nurses and midwives, Partners In Health (PIH) established the Nursing Center of Excellence in 2019 to address the nursing shortages. This center aims to recruit, train, and empower healthcare professionals, with a focus on nursing specialists. 18. ZambiaNurses Per 10,000: 18In rural Zambia, a severe shortage of healthcare workers, particularly nurses and midwives, is exacerbated by rapid population growth. Zambia is one of the countries that need nurses the most. 17. UgandaNurses Per 10,000: 17In Uganda, only 2,000 nurses are employed in government hospitals, as reported by Africa News. Low job prospects and insufficient salaries drive many nurses to seek work overseas and thus, creates concerns about healthcare staffing shortages and the ability to provide care for the population.16. Timor LesteNurses Per 10,000: 16.5Timor-Leste's healthcare system faced severe shortages after gaining independence in 2002, as over 70% of their facilities were destroyed and were only left with 20 doctors. While improvements have occurred, shortages of doctors, specialists, nurses, and midwives persist, which has severely impacted the coverage and quality of healthcare. Timor Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world.15. BoliviaNurses Per 10,000: 16Nursing shortages in Bolivia are primarily due to several factors. First, limited educational opportunities and low salaries discourage individuals from pursuing nursing careers. Many Bolivian nurses also seek higher-paying positions abroad which results in a brain drain. Additionally, challenging working conditions and inadequate resources in healthcare facilities contribute to job dissatisfaction and attrition. The country's geographic disparities also exacerbate the issue, as healthcare access is often unevenly distributed, with rural areas experiencing acute shortages. 14. IndiaNurses Per 10,000: 16India has currently a severe nursing crisis with only 1.7 nurses per 1000 people, far below the WHO recommendation of three nurses per 1000. Despite having over three million registered nurses, the country requires at least 4.3 million more by 2024 to meet international standards. Factors contributing to the crisis include low salaries, poor working conditions, and a lack of respect for the profession. 13. NicaraguaNurses Per 10,000: 15One major reason for nurse shortages in Nicargua is low salaries, which fail to attract and retain qualified nursing professionals. Additionally, there's a lack of adequate education and training facilities to produce a sufficient number of nurses to meet the growing healthcare demands. Emigration plays a role as well, as many nurses seek higher-paying opportunities abroad and leave the domestic healthcare system understaffed. 12. Dominican RepublicNurses Per 10,000: 14The Dominican Republic faces a projected nurse shortage of 10,000 to 20,000 by 2030, with a current density of 14 nurses per 10,000 population. In 2018, there were 14,668 nursing personnel in the country which consisted of 3,864 nursing professionals, per reports from WHO. The share of nurses within the health workforce is only 26%.11. ColombiaNurses Per 10,000: 14Colombia is in urgent need of nurses due to a severe shortage, exacerbated by increased healthcare demands and population growth. Addressing this scarcity is crucial for maintaining and improving healthcare services in the country to ensure the well-being of its citizens.Click here to see the 10 Countries that Need Nurses the Most.Suggested Articles:22 Highest Paid Medical Specialties in the World15 Best Medical Specialties for Female Doctors and Moms22 Medical Schools with the Highest Acceptance Rates in AmericaDisclosure: None. 35 Countries that Need Nurses the Most is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That division is the largest at Goldman, housing investment banking as well as trading operations.The executive who previously held that role, Will Bousquette, will become chief operating officer of the bank’s asset and wealth management division. Bousquette is succeeding 27-year Goldman veteran Laurence Stein, who will retire at the end of the year.Goldman is turning to two veteran company figures for these new roles following a series of high-profile executive departures this year, including Julian Salisbury, who was chief investment officer of asset and wealth management, and Dina Powell McCormick, who was head of the bank's sovereign business.McCormick left to join BDT &amp; MSD Partners, which is run by co-CEO Gregg Lemkau, yet another ex-Goldman exec. Lemkau previously was in charge of investment banking for Goldman.Bousquette, the new COO of asset and wealth management, joined Goldman in 1998. Leslie, the new COO of global banking and marrkets, joined the firm in 1996.Leslie will now report to the firm’s three co-heads of global banking and markets, Ashok Varadhan, Dan Dees, and Jim Esposito.It's possible that the chief administrative officer role she held will reemerge in the future, but the bank has no plans to fill it in the short term, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.The reorganization comes amid scrutiny of CEO David Solomon, who is under pressure to improve Goldman's results after reporting the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years.David Solomon, Goldman's CEO.

It's down 5% since the beginning of January.Under Solomon, the bank is attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer lending while it waits out a tepid period of dealmaking in investment banking.It does, however, stand to benefit from a new string of initial public offerings starting this week. It is acting as one of the lead bankers for IPOs from chipmaker ARM and grocery e-commerce company Instacart.Solomon said in a Friday interview with Yahoo Finance that if the IPOs go well, it could create a ""virtuous cycle"" that attracts other companies still waiting on the sidelines.""Obviously an environment with more capital markets activity is a good environment for Goldman Sachs,"" he said.Solomon said the firm is now emphasizing its principal businesses of investment banking, markets, and wealth management.""That's where the lion's share of the firm's focus is at this point in time,” he said Friday.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

MCFT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, UBS Group AG UBS and The Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Trex Company is seeing resilient consumer demand in 2023. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has beat on earnings 3 quarters in a row.Trex is a manufacturer of high-performance, low maintenance and eco-friendly wood-alternative decking and railing. Its products are stocked in more than 6,700 retail locations worldwide, including at Home Depot and Lowe's.A Big Earnings Beat in the Second QuarterOn July 31, 2023, Trex reported its second quarter results and easily blew by the Zacks Consensus, reporting earnings of $0.71 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.54. That's a 31.5% beat.It was the third consecutive earnings beat in a row. Trex has only missed twice in the last 5 years.Revenue was $357 million, which was down 5% from last year's revenue of $386 million as the channel was building inventory. It saw margin expansion, however, with gross margin of 43.9% compared to 40.7% a year ago.Trex saw mid-single digit growth in the channel sell through as consumer demand remained resilient.The company also launched Trex Select T-Rail system, a value priced composite railing that rounds out its portfolio at the entry level. It is designed to compete with PVC vinyl railing.Announced Full Year GuidanceTrex has improving visibility so it was finally able to provide full year 2023 revenue guidance. It expects revenues to range from $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion. This is below last year's revenue of $1.11 billion. It's still rebounding from last year's inventory build.The analysts are more bullish, however, as the Zacks Consensus is calling for $1.08 billion, above the company's guidance range.Story continuesThe analysts are also bullish on earnings as well. 9 estimates were revised higher in the last 2 months which pushed the Zacks Consensus up to $1.76 from $1.61. This is still 2.2% below last year's earnings of $1.80, however.But looking forward, the analysts are even more bullish on 2024 as the Zacks Consensus has jumped to $2.11, which is earnings growth of 19.7%.Trex Was a Big Pandemic WinnerAs we stayed home during the pandemic, what did we do? We put on new decks. Trex was a huge pandemic winner as its shares soared.But in 2022, the stock sold off along with the other growth stocks, only to rally again in 2023. Shares of Trex are up 59% year-to-date as the consumer has kept spending and the US has avoided a recession. But on a 2-year stack, it's still down 40%.Timing matters.Trex saw an opportunity while its shares were lower. In the second quarter, Trex repurchased 264,896 shares for $16 million.On a P/E basis, Trex is not a ""cheap"" stock. It trades with a forward P/E of 39.1.But for those investors who believe that the consumer will continue to spend on their home, Trex is one to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:The boom times are over for MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expecting to see a dramatic decline in earnings and sales in Fiscal 2024.MasterCraft designs and manufactures recreational powerboats through three brands: MasterCraft, Crest and Aviara. It has two segments of the powerboat industry, performance sport boats and pontoon boats, while also entering the luxury day boat segment.Retail Sales Slowed in Fiscal Q4 2023On Aug 30, 2023, MasterCraft reported its fiscal fourth quarter 2023 and full year 2023 results. The pandemic was a catalyst for the boating industry as consumers bought boats during the lock downs to be outdoors.Fiscal 2023 was the third consecutive record year for earnings and sales for the company. It was also the most profitable fiscal year in the Company's history as net sales rose to $662 million, up 3.2% over the prior year.It saw the highest cash flow in the company's history at $134 million. Times were good.MasterCraft also beat on the fiscal fourth quarter for the 13th time in a row. It reported earnings of $1.37 versus the Zacks Consensus of $1.08.It has an excellent earnings surprise track record with just one miss in the last 5 years.But as the fourth quarter progressed, MasterCraft saw retail sales slow significantly. It reduced production plans but dealer inventories at the end of fiscal 2023 were at higher levels than the company would consider optimal.Fiscal 2024 Guidance Was Below Consensus“Macroeconomic factors, including elevated interest rates as well as tightening credit standards and availability, are creating significant uncertainty which is limiting our retail demand visibility,"" said Fred Brightbill, CEO.""In addition, the general expectation for an economic downturn during fiscal 2024 will likely be a headwind for the industry.""As a result, it guided net sales to be between $390 million and $420 million, well under the $662 million it made in fiscal 2023.The earnings guidance was in the range of $1.46 to $1.88, well below the consensus of $4.03.As a result, the analysts have had to slash their earnings and sales estimates. 5 earnings estimates have been cut since the Q4 earnings report which has pushed the Zacks Consensus down to $1.81.That's at the high end of the company's guidance range, but it is still 66.2% below the record $5.35 the company made last year.Shares Plunge in the Last MonthWith earnings and sales expected to fall sharply in fiscal 2024, it's not surprising that the shares fell on the news. They're down 22.4% in the last month.Over the last year, they're up, but just 0.7%. Will they re-test the Sep 2022 lows soon?Shares are cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.8.With the record free cash flow, the company has been buying back shares. MasterCraft bought back $22.9 million in shares in fiscal 2023.But with the possibility of a recession looming, investors should probably stay away from this boat manufacturer until there is visibility on the consumer.Additional content:Goldman Sachs Plans New Round of Job CutsThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is planning another wave of job cuts that could take place as soon as next month, per Financial Times article.This is a part of its yearly practice of letting go of those employees who are deemed to be the lowest performers.The expected move usually affects between 1-5% of GS’ total staff. It is aiming to cut jobs at the lower end of the range, primarily in its main business divisions like investment banking and trading.Markedly, GS has undergone a minimum of three phases of layoffs since last September. These initiatives are part of the company's deep cost-savings drive amid slump in deal making activity.Reportedly, in June 2023, Goldman announced job cuts of more than 30 IB positions across the Asia region and considered firing around 125 managing directors across the globe.Further, during the first quarter of 2023, GS trimmed its headcount by 3,200, marking its biggest round of layoffs since 2008 financial crisis. In September last year, the company also announced an employment reduction of about 500 jobs.Goldman’s shares have lost 4.2% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 2.6%.GS presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereSimilar to Goldman, UBS Group AG and The Charles Schwab Corp. have been reducing their workforce.Reportedly UBS is expected to cut around 3,000 jobs in Switzerland in the upcoming period. It had been planning on workforce reduction at Credit Suisse post its acquisition in order to save costs. UBS expects that during the integration of Credit Suisse more staff would leave on their own accord.Such job cuts are being planned by UBS as it aims to achieve gross cost reductions of more than $10 billion by the end of 2026.SCHW announced a business streamlining plan as part of its cost-saving measures. Per the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company will slash jobs and close or downsize its corporate offices with an aim to achieve at least $500 million in annual cost savings.In addition to cost efficiencies associated with the integration of TD Ameritrade (acquired by SCHW in October 2020), the above-mentioned action is a step taken to simplify its business to better prepare for the post-integration period.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.8%, 1.3% and 1.9%, respectively. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq snapped two straight weeks of gains.The market performance throughout the holiday-shortened week was influenced by growing fear about inflation reversing the downtrend and an eventual slowdown of the economy. Crude oil prices increased on Saudi’s decision not to raise production until the end of 2023. Treasury yields also remained high, fueling investor concerns.Investors will keep a keen watch on the consumer price index numbers slated to be released Wednesday. At least for now, the potential resurgence of inflation and the consequent rate hikes are the major causes of concern.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:Beazer Homes and Carpenter Technology Surge Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of Beazer Homes USA, Inc. BZH have soared 14.2% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 1.9% increase) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on June 28.Another stock, Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, which was also upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 on June 30, has returned 12% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 1.5% increase) since then.Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Story continuesA hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks has returned +10.8% this year (through July 3) versus +16.1% for the S&amp;P 500 Index and +7.7% for the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 Index. The set of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&amp;P 500 Index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the strong recent performance of mega-cap stocks.We are not trying to cherry-pick here. But since this Zacks Model portfolio, consisting of Zacks Rank # 1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 Index is the appropriate benchmark for comparison.Check Beazer Homes’ historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check Carpenter Technology’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives OFG and HealthEquity HigherShares of OFG Bancorp OFG and HealthEquity, Inc.

However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform.

114,7f0ae84d-cbc8-3c22-8930-b134ff5ae8d6,NEM,2023-09-12,Gold Mining Stock Looks Dull for September,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-mining-stock-looks-dull-184708702.html,1694458028,STORY,"['NEM', 'GC=F']","[Gold was at the mercy of the greenback's strength and Treasury yields last week, culminating in a 1.2% loss for the yellow metal. Mining stock Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) has been struggling, too, down 17.5% so far in 2023. It could be a long road back for NEM, especially amid a historically bearish month.NEM 30 DayAccording to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Newmont stock is among the worst stocks on the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) to own this month, looking back 10 years. Per White's Data, NEM averages a loss of 5% in September in the last decade, and finished the month lower eight times. Keep an eye on the equity's 30-day moving average as well, which capped off a bounce off 2023 lows in late August and could continue acting as pressure in September.The brokerage bunch leans bullish, suggesting there is ample room for price-target cuts and/or downgrades moving forward. Of the 16 analysts in coverage, 10 sport a ""buy"" or better rating. Plus, the 12-month consensus price target of $54.25 is a 39.7% premium to current levels.At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), the stock sports a 50-day call/put volume ratio of 4.61, which ranks higher than all but 4% of readings from the past 12 months. Should this optimism begin to unwind, NEM could sink even lower.Now looks like the ideal time to speculate on NEM's next moves with premiums, which are affordably priced. This is per the equity's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 27% that ranks higher than just 15% of readings from the last 12 months, implying low volatility expectations.]"
115,f5edab56-1817-34f5-8ea0-08de3d6a21a9,NEM,2023-09-12,Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 85%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-corporation-nyse-nem-favorite-130221611.html,1694437341,STORY,['NEM'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Newmont's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 17 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Newmont, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Newmont ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Newmont?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Newmont does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Newmont, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Newmont is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.1% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NewmontThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Newmont Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$30m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Newmont  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Goldman found stores with lower-income consumers (those with household incomes from $62,000 to $85,000) saw same-store sales increase 5.6% compared to last year in the second quarter. Those stores include the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Ross Stores (ROST), as well as dollar store chains Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Five Below (FIVE).On the other end, retailers with higher-income consumers (median income between $96,000 and $128,000) saw same-store sales decline 2.2%. Those stores included Bloomingdale's (M), RH (RH), Lululemon (LULU), and Nordstrom (JWN).The analysis fell in line with credit card data Goldman Sachs tracks that showed consumer spending has increased 25% since the start of the pandemic in lower-income zip codes. Meanwhile, spending in middle-income (+22%) and higher-income zip codes (+16%) has increased at a slower pace.Goldman Sachs expects this gap to narrow a bit during the current quarter and through the end of the year as other macro headwinds weigh on the consumer.""One key question is whether management guidance appropriately embeds the expected drag from resuming student loan payments, which we expect will weigh on upcoming retail sales and consumer spending reports,"" Hill wrote.Same-store sales in lower-income stores have been more resilient than those in higher-income stores this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs. (Goldman Sachs)In August, Bank of America released an analysis of its card spending data from the start of the year through July. The data showed higher-income spending had been weaker than lower-income spending on a month-over-month basis for four of the first seven months of the year. BofA attributed part of that divergence to the labor market where higher-income individuals are seeing wages increase at a slower pace while more of the cohort is applying for unemployment benefits.Story continuesInvestors will get another update on consumer spending Thursday with the August retail sales report slated for release.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the animal healthcare market, you can go directly to see 5 Most Owned Dog Breeds in America.In one of our previous articles about the best dog foods, we mentioned that pet ownership around the world is increasing and that having a pet comes with a lot of health benefits for humans. The article also mentions that dogs are by far the most popular pets in the US.The increase in pet ownership is driving growth in the animal healthcare sector. Many people consider pets to be members of their families, and they are willing to invest in their health. As a result, the veterinary healthcare market is becoming a growing field with many opportunities for professionals and businesses in the space.An Analysis of The Growing Animal Healthcare MarketPreviously, during the COVID-19 crisis, temporary lockdowns of manufacturing sites, export bands, and increased focus on treatments for COVID-19 led to supply disruptions and shortages of veterinary medicines in several countries around the world. The pandemic had a negative impact on the animal healthcare market. However, the growing rate of pet ownership and the trend of pet humanization has helped the market recover in a short time.According to a report by Global Market Insights, the global animal healthcare industry was valued at $150.6 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% during 2023-2032, propelling the global animal healthcare sector to reach around $238 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The growing rate of pet adoption for companionship is expected to help the market grow significantly during the forecast period. The increasing importance of the production of livestock animals is also expected to augment growth in the global animal healthcare market. Growing availability of animal healthcare products at supermarkets and hypermarkets is expected to help the market expand in the coming years.Story continuesIn a recent article about the smartest dog breeds, we discussed that a large percentage of cats and dogs as pets in the US were classified as obese or overweight in 2022. Moreover, animals and pets are currently being affected by a number of new diseases, and the animal health sector is positioned to be a leading force for positive change during the forecast period. There has been an increase in new diseases in animals. And as the global population swells, there has been an increase in global consumption of meat and milk. Some of these novel diseases have potential to be transmitted to humans through animal product consumption and companionship. The need for developing treatments, medications and vaccines have provided some of the top players in the market with lucrative opportunities.A Look at the Major Players in the Animal Healthcare MarketThe COVID-19 crisis created new opportunities for market growth, and now eHealth applications and telehealth are becoming more popular, with Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) jumping on the bandwagon too. On May 22, Reuters reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has signed a deal with pet telehealth provider Pawp to offer the retailer's subscribed members access to veterinary professionals, without the need for an appointment, through video or text. According to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Walmart+ customers can use Pawp's services for a year as it looks to tap growing demand for pet telehealth from inflation-hit customers looking for low-priced alternatives. Additionally, the report by Reuters mentions that Petco Health and Wellness Company Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) has also been expanding their telehealth offerings. The well-known health and wellness company for pets pegged the value of the pet industry at $119 billion in 2021.On August 17, Petco Health and Wellness Company Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF) also announced an expanded partnership with DoorDash Inc.

Pet Parents will now have greater access to Petco's (NASDAQ:WOOF) curated selection of pet health products for on-demand delivery through the DoorDash's (NYSE:DASH) mobile app and website.As the demand for veterinary services rises with new diseases, top market players in the animal healthcare industry are developing and launching new treatments and vaccines in order to enhance their market presence. On May 2, Reuters reported that Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN) received a conditional license from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for its antibody to treat canine parvovirus, making it the first approved therapy. Parvovirus, which is a highly contagious disease and can spread by direct dog-to-dog contact and contact with contaminated feces, causes acute gastrointestinal illnesses such as diarrhea and vomiting. The therapy is a one-shot intravenous treatment and belongs to a class of treatments known as monoclonal antibodies. It is Elanco Animal Health Incorporated’s (NYSE:ELAN) first monoclonal antibody therapy. Jeff Simmons, CEO of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN), said:""This will be the second product that goes into a major global market with blockbuster potential up to $100 million.""On August 7, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.18, beating the EPS estimates by $0.13. The company reported a revenue of $1.06 billion and surpassed revenue estimates by $17.47 million. Here are some comments from Elanco Animal Health Incorporated’s (NYSE:ELAN) Q2 2023 earnings call:“In the U.S., we launched our canine parvovirus monoclonal antibody, a highly anticipated treatment for one of the most contagious and deadly dog viruses. The supply chain is enabling responsiveness and the product is already saving dogs' lives, driving reorders. As expected, in 2023, demand is outpacing supply due to the anticipated capacity limitations in our facility at launch.We are on track to ramp up our capacity to 10x today's volume to support the expected increase in demand in the coming years. This year, we expect revenue contribution of $5 million to $7 million. However, we see this product as an important growth driver to both the top- and bottom-line starting in 2024 and expect blockbuster contribution as we expand outside the U.S. over time.”Investments in research and development projects by key players is also expected to influence the animal healthcare market positively while also contributing to the market’s growth in the coming years. On September 7, Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), the world's largest producer of medicine and vaccinations for pets and livestock, reported that the Zoetis Foundation has allocated $2.6 million in grants to advance opportunities for veterinarians and livestock farmers.

121,0a63150d-c55f-398f-a2de-b3d81b607ae8,NEE,2023-09-12,12 Best Utilities ETFs to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-utilities-etfs-buy-144210643.html,1694443330,STORY,"['DUK', 'NEE']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best utilities ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our introduction to the utility sector, then take a look at 5 Best Utilities ETFs to Buy. Courtesy of the global shift to renewable energy and the turmoil in the energy market after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the utility industry has shaped up to be one of the rather dynamic sectors you're likely to come across. Utility companies are the backbone of the economy, as they are responsible for providing electricity, water, gas, waste management, and other services to keep modern day cities functional. At the same time, the financial health of utilities and the way their payment structures are quite important, as improper management or structuring can often lead to fiscally unsustainable arrangements that have the potential to collapse entire economies.The biggest example of this phenomenon comes through the ailing Western Asian nation Lebanon. Lebanon is the perfect case study of the effects of a divergence in the interests of a country's ruling elite and its citizens. Its financial system is dominated by Hezbollah and banks became insolvent in 2019 as the country was unable to keep the U.S. dollar stable. This depreciation of the Lebanese Pound left its government unable to buy oil to run power plants. which led to nationwide blackouts. The impact of a poor economy continues to be felt in the Lebanese power sector, as the government is capable of providing only a couple of hours of electricity during the day with the remaining power generation left to the consumer. At the heart of the crisis is the utility Électricité du Liban (EDL) which often sees nepotistic management providing lucrative contracts on favoritism and profit from the market for diesel generators as well.Another country that has failed to manage its utilities is Pakistan. One of the most populous nations in the world, Pakistan's energy sector is a ticking time bomb. The government is the only entity allowed to purchase electricity in the country, and it often fails to recover these costs from distribution companies leading to circular debt of billions of dollars. The country saw protests in major cities earlier this year after the government increased electricity prices to remove subsidies and recover the circular debt, and officials, who often benefit from state provided free of cost electricity, have been unable to come up with solutions to solve these problems.Story continuesSafe to say, the utility sector is far more important to a country's economic health than is generally believed. Switching gears and focusing on the U.S., the American utilities market was worth $993 billion in 2020 and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.5% until 2025 to be worth an estimated $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The U.S. utility market was also better off last year when compared to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) peers as far as energy inflation was concerned. Energy inflation in the OECD stood at 28.1% last year on average, while inflation in the U.S. was at 17.1%. However, since America generates a large portion of its electricity from natural gas, it also suffered from high electricity prices which shot up to multi year highs as global demand for natural gas soared and led to tight supplies. Some of the biggest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO), and you can check out 16 Biggest Utility Companies in the US for all the details about the U.S. utility sector.As to what lies ahead for the utility sector, here's what the management of Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) had to say during the firm's second quarter earnings call:The long term residential growth trajectory remains strong. In fact, residential volumes have averaged just under 1% growth per year for the past five years, and are 4% above pre pandemic levels. In the commercial class, second quarter volumes are trending above our full year estimate, supported by continued growth in data centers. In the industrial class, planned investment in our territories continues to be robust. Many of our large customers are expanding, and we partnered with our states to attract over 29,000 new jobs and $23 billion in capital investment in 2022.These investments represent several key sectors such as battery, EVs and semiconductors, and we expect they will provide around 2000 megawatts of demand as operations ramp up. The strength of our service territories was also reflected in CNBCs annual list of America’s top states for business, were five of the states we serve ranked in the top 15 and North Carolina ranked number one for the second year in a row. In the near term, we’ve seen a slight pullback in some of our manufacturing customers due to softening demand in certain sectors of the economy. We’re monitoring the impact of macroeconomic trends but the underlying fundamentals, residential customer growth, and commercial and industrial investment continue to support long term growth at roughly 0.5% per year.Moving towards exchange traded funds (ETFs), there are among the many ways in which one can invest in the stock market. ETFs provide a collection of stocks to invest in and they are generally traded similarly to shares on the market. Each unit or share of an ETF represents the collective share price performance of its constituents and an ETF can also be considered as an instrument that allows a regular investor to outsource stock selection to others and simply invest in sectors that they believe should do well in the current economic environment.Today, we'll focus on ETFs that target the utility industry, and some notable picks in the selection are iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (BATS:IFRA), Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (BATS:PAVE), and Virtus Reaves Utilities ETF (NYSE:UTES).

WDIV has been able to amass assets over $223.18 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the World ETFs. WDIV, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index.The S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index measures the performance of high dividend-yield companies included in the S&amp;P Global BMI that have followed a managed-dividends policy of increasing or stable dividends for at least ten consecutive years.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Adecco Group Ag Reg (ADEN) accounts for about 2% of the fund's total assets, followed by A2a Spa (A2A) and Sumitomo Forestry Co Ltd.The top 10 holdings account for about 15.99% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, WDIV has gained about 0.01%, and is down about -0.24% in the last one year (as of 09/12/2023). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $51.92 and $62.68.The ETF has a beta of 0.81 and standard deviation of 13.95% for the trailing three-year period, making it a low risk choice in the space. With about 119 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $17.85 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $28.96 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MARA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MARAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAssessing Risks with Marathon Digital HoldingsDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Marathon Digital Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.16. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewMarathon Digital Holdings Inc focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The Company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. The Company's Cryptocurrency Machines are located in the United States.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapBreaking Down Marathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Marathon Digital Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The first factor we need to consider is a measure of short-term liquidity. This is calculated as the working capital divided by total assets. When we evaluate the data provided: 2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00, it's clear that Marathon Digital Holdings has experienced a declining trend in its Working Capital to Total Assets ratio over the past few years. This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. The ratio is strikingly low, which unfavorably influences the overall Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Marathon Digital Holdings's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionBased on the analysis above, it becomes apparent that while Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) may seem undervalued at first glance, the underlying financial health of the company suggests it may be a potential value trap. This highlights the importance of conducting thorough due diligence before making investment decisions. It's not just about the price, but the intrinsic value and financial stability of the company that matters most.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The French sugar beet crop area fell to a 14-year low this year.Story continuesEuropean sugar was trading at 915 euros ($983.17) per ton on July 2023, the most recent EU data showed, up 57% on the previous year and twice the price recorded in July 2021.""We must be careful not to fall into the opposite extreme,"" Franck Sander, chairman of French sugar beet union CGB, told Reuters, warning that a rise in area could make EU prices slump.""A turnaround could happen very quickly, prices could fall 30%, especially since there are large supplies in Ukraine.""Saint Louis Sucre closed two factories in 2019 as part of a wider restructuring plan at Suedzucker, Europe’s largest sugar refiner. It still has two in northern France.The European Union's sugar output is expected to rebound in 2023/24 from the previous year, mainly due to a larger crop in Poland where farmers, attracted by higher prices, had boosted the area sown.($1 = 0.9307 euros)(Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide, additional reporting by Nigel Hunt in London and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas, gearing up for the biggest initial public offering of the year, is pitching investors on a pivot.Most Read from BloombergCaesars Entertainment Paid Millions to Hackers in AttackVideo-Game Company Unity Closes Offices Following Death ThreatWhen the Homeowners Association Comes for Your HomeDisney Holds Initial Talks on Sale of ABC to Local Broadcaster NexstarRussian Elite Bring Back $50 Billion of Assets as Havens DwindleHis message to potential shareholders is that Arm is poised to become a bigger and more profitable business — not just because of the industrywide boom in cloud computing and artificial intelligence, but also due to a major change in how it operates.Read More: Arm IPO Is Oversubscribed by 10 Times With Books Closing Tuesday“We made a significant shift in our strategy,” Haas said in a video presentation for prospective investors seen by Bloomberg.For most of its history, Arm’s main focus has been designing chips for smartphones and other electronics and then selling that technology for pennies per chip to companies like Qualcomm Inc. But now, Arm is doing complex design work focused on specific products, tailored for what it sees as key areas of growth. It’s a “purpose-built approach” addressing the urgent needs of companies making mobile devices, cloud computing, car electronics and internet-connected technology, Haas said in the presentation.Getting that message across is key to the lofty valuation. Arm had said it’s seeking as much as $54.5 billion in its IPO this week, though it’s proving so popular with investors that the company may raise the price range for the shares. The listing is oversubscribed by 10 times, and bankers are planning to stop taking orders a day early, by Tuesday afternoon, people familiar with the matter have said. Arm still plans to price its shares on Wednesday, the people said. It’s not uncommon for books to close early on an IPO, which often indicates strong demand.Story continuesIt’s a big markup from 2016, when SoftBank Corp.’s Masayoshi Son bought Arm for $32 billion. To bolster the point that Arm really is a different company, the video presentation features endorsements from Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang and James Hamilton, architect of much of Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS hardware, among others.Huang, in a reference to his failed attempt to purchase Arm for $40 billion in 2022, said the world knows how much he loves Arm and praised Haas’ shift into new markets, particularly the artificial intelligence ecosystem. Nvidia, now the most valuable chip company, is backing Arm’s IPO and plans to be a strategic investor.It was Nvidia’s unsuccessful pursuit of Arm that led to Haas’ overhaul. His pitch for the CEO job — when his predecessor, Simon Segars, stepped down in early 2022 — was that Arm was doing much of the work in defining technology in the mobile phone and computing industries but wasn’t being paid or valued accordingly.Chipmakers like Qualcomm and Broadcom Inc. have licensed Arm’s partial designs and computer code and put them in their own chips. The products adhere to industry standards, making it easy for software makers to ensure that various forms of technology are compatible. That’s why Arm’s designs are in nearly every mobile phone made today.When Son acquired Arm, his big push was to bring that same compatibility to the so-called Internet of Things. As more and more devices became connected, he reasoned, they’d need the kind of coherency around standards that made the mobile phone industry grow so quickly.His argument to investors eight years ago was that — while Arm was already pervasive in the billion-unit smartphone market — the proliferation of computing into everything from household electronics to factory equipment and traffic signals would take it into billions of new devices.Haas has flipped Arm’s emphasis, saying more isn’t necessarily better. He has pushed Arm to move beyond licensing the basic building blocks of chips and instead provide customers with blueprints they can take straight to the factory and put into production. Now Arm is charging much higher royalty rates per device because it offers customers more complete designs that are more technologically capable.Arm’s pivot is an attempt to take advantage of a shift that’s been brewing for several years. Some of the biggest technology companies have increasingly started to see the ability to make the fundamental components of their products and systems as a key competitive advantage.Apple Inc.’s A and M series processors are the most obvious example, powering devices from MacBooks to iPads. Likewise, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and their Chinese counterparts are also trying to equip data centers with chips that fit their specific needs, instead of relying on Intel Corp. for generic solutions.That’s given Arm the chance to do complete designs for chips that may cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.All About Arm and Why It’s The Biggest IPO of 2023: QuickTakeWhile Arm might get paid low-single-digit dollars on a $30 main chip in a smartphone, the potential inside the kind of processor that’s at the heart of a cloud data center is much greater. In that kind of environment, chips can have more than a hundred computing cores, or mini processors, and Arm can charge more than a dollar per core.The revenue opportunity in cloud computing will grow to $28 billion by 2025, expanding at a rate of 17% per year from now, Arm Chief Financial Officer Jason Child said in the video presentation.The company has a gross margin, or percentage of revenue remaining after deducting costs of production, of 95%. Going forward, Arm will decide on the level of profitability it wants to deliver depending on industry circumstances.When the chip business goes through changes, Arm is likely to invest more into research and development to gear itself up for opportunities. When it’s more stable, profitability will increase, he said.“For chips where our products have provided more value, we will typically receive a higher royalty rate per chip,” Arm said in a recent securities filing. “Accordingly, we believe that our investments in higher performance, higher efficiency, and more specialized designs will drive greater demand for our products and higher value for our customers, which is expected to result in higher royalty fees.”That makes Arm increasingly a competitor for its chipmaker customers who want to be seen as the ones who add the most value for the computer and phone makers they supply.A legal dispute between Arm and Qualcomm, which centers around the fees the San Diego chipmaker has to pay too use another Arm licensee it acquired, is a sign of this increasing tension.Switching to another instruction set — the basic code that a chip uses to communicate with software — away from Arm’s would cause chipmakers like Qualcomm massive headaches. So even as they persist in trying to out-design the UK-based company, they’ll likely have to stick with using its basic technology.(Updates with detail on pricing in fifth paragraph.

Still, Qualcomm’s stock spiked roughly +4% today with Apple's stock up +0.66%. The continuation of their partnership is reassuring to Qualcomm investors as it was scheduled to end this year but has now been extended to 2026.Of course, there are rising concerns that the Chinese goverment will continue its efforts to ban iPhones domestically which will naturally affect Qualcomm as well. However, momentum is building for both tech giants with Apple scheduled to release its iPhone 15 on Tuesday and Qualcomm now solidified with providing its modem chips for the foreseeable future.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPartnership Growth (EPS)Starting their partnership in 2019, Apple and Qualcomm have experienced steady growth but are expecting dips in their top and bottom lines this year.Mostly attributed to inflationary pressures and a softer recovery in China, Qualcomm's fiscal 2023 results are being affected the most. With that being said, Qualcomm is coming off a record year that saw earnings at $12.53 per share with FY23 EPS projected to drop to $8.31 a share.Qualcomm’s FY24 earnings are forecasted to stabilize and rise 10% to $9.13 per share. Plus, FY24 projections would still represent 134% EPS growth since the company launched its partnership with Apple and posted earnings of $3.54 a share in 2019.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs for Apple, annual earnings are expected to dip -1% this year but rebound and rise 9% in FY24 to $6.60 per share. More impressive, FY24 projections would represent 122% EPS growth since its Qualcomm partnership with Apple’s 2019 earnings at $2.97 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesPartnership PerformanceSince their partnership officially started in April of 2019, Apple’s stock has now skyrocketed +265% with Qualcomm shares soaring +90%. Both have outperformed the Nasdaq’s +70% and the S&amp;P 500's +54% during this time span.Even better, when including dividends, Apple's total return is +278% with Qualcomm at +111% to easily top the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividend BoostAs forementioned in their total returns, Apple and Qualcomm have continued to boost their dividends since their partnership started. Qualcomm certainly stands out with a 2.91% annual yield that towers over the S&amp;P 500’s 1.36% average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile Apple offers a modest 0.54% dividend yield, it has increased in each of the last five years at a 6.07% growth rate which is just above Qualcomm’s 5.35%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Considering their stock performances and growth since partnering, Apple and Qualcomm have complemented each other quite well. For now, Apple and Qualcomm's stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While there are still fears of a further crackdown on iPhones in China, these companies should continue to mutually benefit each other and reward longer-term investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The successful execution of the electronic attack task by AI agents shows how autonomous uncrewed aerial systems can operate in coordination with crewed tactical platforms in future combat operations, creating a powerful, unified team to address complex threats.OPL’s human-piloted L-29s flying as surrogate advanced UAS as they prepare to execute the virtual electronic attack mission (Photo Credit: Collin Clemons)This project, named Enhanced Collaborative High-Frequency Orientation System (ECHOS), was sponsored by Lockheed Martin's 21st Century Security Demonstrations &amp; Prototypes (D&amp;P) organization. ""ECHOS is a terrific example of using artificial intelligence and UAS to further enable the DOD vision of Joint All Domain Operations (JADO), providing new capabilities to identify targets and deliver effects,"" said Joe Villani, Lockheed Martin D&amp;P vice president.The L-29s were flown by experienced OPL pilots, following instructions from the AI agents in the form of heading, altitude, and speed cues. Demonstrating how AI can provide data for rapid decision making and increased mission effectiveness by reducing pilot workload. The pilots maintained the option to stop following AI cues if at any point they felt unsafe, or the agent tried to go outside acceptable operating conditions.""This was an awesome experience, and the event went smoothly. It was an exceptional example of industry and academia working together on a cutting-edge project. We're excited to take this to the next level,"" said Tom ""Mach"" Schnell, OPL founder and director.The AI agents were trained using advanced deep multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, incentivizing emergent collaborative tactics. There is minimal reward shaping on these agents, emphasizing mission completion. Agents were able to learn these tactics with sparse rewards, ensuring the best possible tactics for the mission were executed.Story continuesThis demonstration focused on sim-to-real transfer to train an AI agent in a simulated environment, fly it on real aircraft and test the behavior. The tests successfully demonstrated AI agents can be trusted to deliver high performance and reliable behaviors. Throughout day one of testing, the agents aligned between the fighter and target within a very tight tolerance, never allowing the radar to get a track on the fighter. The team successfully completed all test cards ahead of schedule in three days of testing.By the end of 2023, the Skunk Works and OPL team will test AI in an end-to-end Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD/DEAD) mission. Lessons learned will inform follow-on AI/autonomy development in support of future programs such as the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), as well as ongoing crewed-uncrewed teaming development.

The latest contract win is a bright example of that.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is likely to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one.

But at least one study participant was exposed to an additional source of asbestos, and J&amp;J said it believes that other study participants also have additional asbestos exposure.An attorney for Moline declined to comment on Monday beyond what was filed in court.Moline, who works at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York, said in her court filing that her study properly disclosed that all information about the patients' exposure to asbestos came from testimony that they provided during their lawsuits. The study also disclosed a potential conflict of interest related to her work as a plaintiffs' expert.Story continuesWhen one patient separately filed a workers' compensation claim that appeared to contradict her court testimony by alleging a different source of asbestos exposure, Moline updated her paper to say that she should not have included that patient, but stood by her paper's conclusions, according to her court filing.J&amp;J has attempted to resolve the talc litigation by putting LTL Management in bankruptcy, and as part of that process offered $8.9 billion to end all current and future lawsuits alleging that talc causes cancer. Its efforts have so far been thwarted by court rulings that the company is not in sufficient financial distress to qualify for bankruptcy protection.J&amp;J has appealed those rulings, while also stepping up attacks on scientific studies that have been used as evidence in talc lawsuits.The talc lawsuits have a mixed record at trial, with J&amp;J winning several verdicts but losing some others, including a $2.1 billion judgment awarded to 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company's talc products. The lawsuits had been paused by LTL's bankruptcy, but they are free to resume now that the bankruptcy has been dismissed.J&amp;J has stopped selling talc-based Baby Powder in favor of cornstarch-based products, citing an increase in lawsuits and ""misinformation"" about the talc product's safety.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds, and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend ETFs.Investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a good investment strategy for many investors as they offer several advantages, including diversification, liquidity, and typically lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. They provide access to a wide range of asset classes, from stocks and bonds to commodities and real estate, allowing investors to create a diversified portfolio that aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance. While ETFs have grown significantly in popularity and their assets have increased substantially in recent years, they still represent only a fraction of the total global financial market. According to a report by iShares, ETFs in the US represent 12.6% of equity assets. In Europe, they account for roughly 8% of stock investments, and in the Asia-Pacific region, they represent approximately 4.2% of stock investments.That said, investors often prefer ETFs because they offer easy and convenient solutions for investing. Investors seeking income and stability in their portfolios gravitate toward dividend-focused ETFs. These funds provide a consistent stream of income through dividends paid by the underlying stocks. Additionally, many dividend ETFs focus on companies with a history of dividend growth, offering the potential for income to increase over time, which can help protect against inflation. In one of our articles on the subject published in May this year, we mentioned that there are around 180 dividend ETFs in the US, and these ETFs have a combined value of more than $384 billion.Also read: 10 Best Performing Small-cap ETFs in 2023Most dividend ETFs follow one of two strategies. The first group invests in stocks that offer high dividend payments. The second group, on the other hand, concentrates on stocks known as dividend-growth stocks. These stocks may not have extremely high dividend yields, but they come from financially stable companies that have consistently increased their dividend payments over time. Because of this, dividend-growth stocks typically show some strength during market downturns and economic slowdowns. We have previously covered various aspects of dividend growth stocks and reported that companies with strong dividend growth track records outperformed because of the compounding effect.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

Data from this cohort of the THOR study showed that Balversa reduced the risk of death in patients with advanced, FGFR-altered UC by 36% versus chemotherapy.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -7.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has gained 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.52 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.03 points to a change of -1.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.88 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.3 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $84.7 billion and $92.42 billion estimates indicate -10.8% and +9.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $25.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $2.80 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.43%. The EPS surprise was +7.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This style score condenses all the essential metrics from the company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth.Factors Boding WellAs a prominent waste disposal firm, Republic Services is poised to capitalize on ongoing trends such as growing environmental awareness, rapid industrial growth, population expansion and government initiatives to combat illegal dumping. The company's primary focus is on enhancing recycling volumes through upgraded material handling methods and initiatives.Republic Services, Inc. PriceRepublic Services, Inc. PriceRepublic Services, Inc. price | Republic Services, Inc. QuoteIn the previous year, RSG introduced its inaugural Polymer Center to boost plastic recycling throughout North America. The company experienced robust 19.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2022.Republic Services is committed to enhancing operational efficiency and cutting down fleet operating expenses by transitioning to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles. In 2022, approximately 20% of the company's recycling and solid waste collection fleet utilized CNG, and 17% of their new recycling and solid waste vehicle acquisitions were CNG-based. At the end of 2022, RSG operated 45 CNG fueling stations.Republic Services' current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of the second quarter of 2023 was 0.76, higher than 0.74 reported at the end of the previous quarter and the prior-year quarter's figure of 0.73. An increase in the current ratio indicates that the company should not have problems meeting its short-term obligations.Key RisksRepublic Services depends on purchasing fuel from the open market to operate its collection and transfer trucks and equipment for environmental services. Fuel prices are characterized by significant unpredictability and are susceptible to fluctuations due to various factors. RSG may encounter challenges in completely offsetting rising fuel expenses through fuel recovery fees due to contractual or market constraints.Story continuesIn 2022, the company's fuel costs amounted to $631.1 million, making up 4.7% of its revenues, in contrast to the $383 million spent in 2021, which represented 3.4% of its revenues. Republic Services experiences significant seasonality in its revenues, leading to reduced income and heightened operational risks.RSG carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Here are some better-ranked stocks from the Business Services sector that may be considered by investors:DocuSign DOCU currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 27.1%.

That’s not to say you should exclusively focus on these publicly traded securities. However, if the broader market begins to falter, you’ll probably be grateful for exposure to stable enterprises.Generally speaking, the best investing ideas at this juncture center on core necessities. That is, you want to focus on companies that will remain relevant even if economic conditions worsen. As such, you should consider letting off the gas on high-flying technology startups and acquiring shares of companies tied to boring but ultimately reliable industries instead.No, it’s not a pretty picture. However, the months ahead may be about wealth protection as opposed to outright wealth attainment. On that note, below are the best investing ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAllstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLet’s face reality — no one gets up in the morning excited about buying shares in insurance giant Allstate (NYSE:ALL). With all due respect to the wonderful industry, the insurance sector is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Nevertheless, it also makes for one of the best investing ideas because of its pricing power.You all may have noticed that your car insurance rates have gone up (and quite significantly for residents of certain areas). Now, I’m sure the reasons for the price hikes are legitimate. But even if they’re not, guess what? You still have to pay. That’s pricing power for you.To be fair, Allstate’s financials appear messy, with a very low cash-to-debt ratio and some ugly hits to the profit margin recently. Nevertheless, the company sports an impressive three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 14.2%. And despite this performance, ALL trades at only 0.54 times sales, favorably below 75% of the competition.Story continuesLooking to the Street, analysts forecast a price tag of $126.42, implying over 14% upside. You very well might be in good hands.Republic Services (RSG)Source: ShutterstockWhen the waste matter hits the proverbial fan, you can bank on Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) as one of the best investing ideas right now. Up nearly 13% since the start of the year, RSG slipped about 3% in the trailing month. This could be your chance to acquire a relative discount. After all, no matter what materializes in the broader economy, someone has to pick up the trash.Considering Americans now carry over $1 trillion in credit card debt, this framework translates to plenty of waste. And the stickiness of consumptive behavior implies more waste production to come. Obviously, as a waste disposal specialist, Republic should clean up (metaphorically speaking) quite nicely.Also, the company benefits from a natural monopoly. Given the political focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) directives, would-be competitors just can’t grab a permit for making new landfills.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg RSG as a moderate buy with a $166.83 price target, implying over 15% upside potential.Five Below (FIVE)storefront of a five belowSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA chain of specialty discount stores, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is one of my favorites for best investing ideas. Obviously, with consumers facing pressure from factors such as stubbornly high inflation to household indebtedness, people need discounts. Five Below provides exactly that but with a touch of dignity, for lack of a better word.I’m not here to trash literal one-dollar stores. However, Five Below presents a range of products that price up to five bucks. Also, the company offers select items that range between $6 and $25. Therefore, the stores don’t just cater to financially strained consumers but rather bargain hunters of all stripes.Also, it’s a growth machine, printing a three-year sales expansion rate of 18.8%. It is consistently profitable — just what you’re looking for ahead of market uncertainty.On a final note, analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $210.50, implying over 24% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(UGP) and Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Ultrapar Participacoes S.A. and Williams Companies, Inc. (The) are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that UGP's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.UGP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.78, while WMB has a forward P/E of 17.54. We also note that UGP has a PEG ratio of 4.63. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. WMB currently has a PEG ratio of 5.01.Another notable valuation metric for UGP is its P/B ratio of 1.59. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Amid various trade deals announced, one standout agreement was Vietnam Airlines' commitment to acquire 50 Boeing (BA) jets. Eurasia Group Global Macro-Geopolitics Senior Analyst Ali Wyne explains why the Biden administration has placed an emphasis on the Indo-Pacific, with a focus on strengthening relations with countries like Australia, India, and Japan. Wyne says the U.S. doesn't want other countries in the region to feel left out, however, saying the administration ""doesn't want smaller countries in the region to feel that they're being left out.""Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, the President announced a number of trade deals during his visit, including Vietnam Airlines buying 50 Boeing Jets and Microsoft announcing AI plans tailored for Vietnam's emerging market. Here to discuss more is Ali Wyne, macro-geopolitics senior analyst at the Eurasia Group. Ali, it's good to talk to you today.Put this in context for us first. This elevated status the US now has with Vietnam, the announcement of these deals-- how significant is it when you consider the historical relationship between the US and Vietnam and where China is today?ALI WYNE: Well, thanks very much for having me on. It's historic for the reasons that you mentioned, given the state of relations between the United States and Vietnam just a few decades ago. It is historic, and I think, as you said, it's important to look at these deals that are being signed in a broader context. The United States has prioritized the Indo-Pacific. It believes that the Indo-Pacific is the most significant theater of strategic competition, and it's trying to bolster its influence in the region.Now, the principal way that the Biden administration has been doing so up until now has been a strength in US relations with its allies in the quad-- this is Australia, India, and Japan. But the administration wants to ensure that it's committed to the entirety of the region, and it doesn't want smaller countries in the region to feel that they're being left out. So the administration, in parallel with its efforts to boost the quad, it's also deepening its engagements with a number of member countries of ASEAN, including Indonesia, including the Philippines, and, of course, Vietnam. So what we see is two parallel lines of effort to bolster America's presence in the Indo-Pacific.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Ali, what kind of response do you think we'll see here from China given the fact that this really just shows us how Biden is looking at the geopolitical relationships here going forward and how he's calculated being able to get to those regions, secure products that the US needs-- that US companies need-- without relying obviously as much on China?ALI WYNE: Well, China is going to be vigilant. China is going to be concerned because, keep in mind, China is not only facing growth headwinds at home, and those growth headwinds, of course, are a critical source of China's influence in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, but China also recognizes that there's a growing coalescence of opposition to China in the region-- in the Indo-Pacific that is-- but beyond. And we just-- to give one example, we saw a few days ago that China published a new map, its so-called 10-dash map, and that elicited a lot of concern from many neighbors with which China has maritime disputes and other territorial disputes.So China is going to be vigilant. I think China also recognizes, though, that many countries in the region, including Vietnam, they're wary of openly aligning too strongly with either the United States or with China. They want to balance security ties with the United States but economic ties with China, and so Vietnam is undertaking a very difficult balancing act.AKIKO FUJITA: What does that tell you about the increasing importance of the region, then, if you've got a country like Vietnam but really ASEAN nations broadly being able to say, look, we are able to play both sides? It seems to point to the significant or growing significance of that region.ALI WYNE: No matter what metric you consider-- whether you look at share of the global economy, whether you look at the share of global defense spending, the share of the global population. No matter what metric you consider, the Indo-Pacific today is the center of geopolitical and geoeconomic gravity, and it will continue to be so. And to your-- to your question, I think what's interesting is one of the narratives that we often hear is that countries in the region will have to make a choice-- a so-called strategic choice-- in which they pick only the United States or only pick China. It's a very common narrative.And I think that what a growing number of countries in the Indo-Pacific are demonstrating is they're flipping the script and they're saying, one, we don't accept that choice, and two, we can actually leverage intensifying US-China competition to our advantage. So if the United States is courting me, if China is courting me, it enhances my freedom of foreign policy maneuver, it gives me more trading and investment opportunities. So Vietnam is demonstrating how we can flip the script in the region and how smaller countries in particular can capitalize on intensifying competition between Washington and Beijing.]"

Students can start participating in grade school and continue through high school graduation.A recent collaboration with Illumina in Cambridge, England, targeted local students age 14 to 16. Volunteers from Illumina worked with them on biodiversity assessments to learn about genomics applications in ecological conservation.""We are here to connect industry and young people,"" says Amy Adamthwaite, head of Programme Development and Delivery at EDT. ""We want to help them see potential career pathways and understand what is available for them.""The program applied skills-building exercises to environmental challenges. These projects gave students opportunities to study biodiversity in their own backyards and highlighted genomics' unique ability to support sustainability.""This project was a collaborative effort between Illumina and EDT from the start,"" says Vanessa Light, CSR STEM lead at Illumina. ""The program was designed and implemented in partnership with Illumina staff, and directly connecting employees with students has been a key aspect to students finding personal connections and seeing themselves in the career journeys of our employees.""The 15-week project paired 60 students with Illumina mentors. Students received master classes on project management, STEM career opportunities, and other topics. While all the projects had one goal-investigate local biodiversity-the approaches varied by team. One studied a pond on school grounds.Story continues""They have this pond, which is quite pretty, but their science department had never done any experiments with the young people there,"" says Adamthwaite. ""They look at this pond every day, but they didn't know anything about it, and this gave them the nudge to actually investigate. Now the students are asking their school to incorporate the pond into their lessons so they can learn more about the natural environment around them.""Concerned about climate change and other environmental issues, the students were highly motivated. After their project was completed, one team wrote their member of parliament, asking the government to dial back grass mowing, as it was damaging biodiversity.""We could see the impact it was making on the students,"" says Adamthwaite. ""It wasn't just doing a project-their passion really shone through.""Illumina mentors feel the impact Senior Information Security Engineer Rob Williams was one of the Illumina mentors.""One of the big drivers for me to volunteer was that I never had anyone come to my school and tell me I could achieve like that,"" he says. ""I think I really missed that kind of support and role model exposure.""His team's project researched biodiversity in the school's playing fields, which had been affected by development, pollution, and other issues. The goal was to catalog existing plants and wildlife and envision alternative ecosystems.""We wanted to identify which plants were growing and the wildlife they attract,"" says Williams, ""as well as explore plants that could attract different species. The students were passionate about identifying issues and enhancing the biodiversity. They photographed and cataloged plants, cross-referenced them online, categorized seasonals and annuals, and looked up the Latin names and the wildlife each one attracts. They were really switched on.""The project culminated in an awards ceremony at the Illumina Centre in Cambridge. One of Williams' groups was honored for Best Overall Assessment, as well as for their report and oral presentation. It was an emotional moment for Williams, who had become far more engaged than he expected.""I felt a real sense of achievement that we had made a positive contribution to their education,"" he says. ""But it also helped me develop as a professional and as a human being. I was not expecting that. I honestly did not anticipate the profound impact this would have on me.""Illumina is committed to inspiring the next generation of genomic leaders, and we are working to nurture a diverse and inclusive STEM workforce for the future. To do this, we collaborate with community partners like Engineering Development Trust that are empowering learners and engage employees like Rob Williams to reach and inspire students of all backgrounds.Click here to learn more about Illumina's commitment to STEM education and our goal of reaching 5 million learners by 2030.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/782726/uk-stem-students-get-hands-on-lessons-in-biodiversity-and-genomics]"

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 8/102. Profitability rank: 9/103. Growth rank: 9/104. GF Value rank: 9/105. Momentum rank: 8/10Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks.

Reuters could not independently verify the allegations.The investor request could add more pressure to sportswear giant Nike, which is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.

Foot Locker has reduced its fiscal-year outlook twice so far in 2023, giving investors plenty of reasons to consider selling the retailing stock, which is down about 50% year to date. Investors shouldn't expect a quick recovery here as Foot Locker's falling profitability illustrates how little pricing power it holds in the industry.Continue reading]"

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 5/102. Profitability rank: 5/103. Growth rank: 0/104. GF Value rank: 2/105. Momentum rank: 4/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned VF Corp the GF Score of 54 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding VF Corp's BusinessVF Corp, with a market cap of $7.16 billion, designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories.

Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.1 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.Profitability BreakdownVF Corp's low Profitability rank can also raise warning signals. With a Piotroski F-Score of 2, VF Corp's financial health appears concerning. This score, rooted in Joseph Piotroski's nine-point scale, evaluates a firm's profitability, liquidity, and operating efficiency. Given its rating, VF Corp might be facing challenges in these areas.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where VF Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value Trap,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vf-vfc-too-good-true-154037119.html,1694446837,STORY,['VFC'],"[Value-focused investors constantly seek stocks priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that deserves attention is VF Corp (NYSE:VFC). The stock, currently priced at 18.38, recorded a loss of 2.26% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 1.73%. The stock's fair valuation is $61.87, as indicated by its GF Value. However, before rushing to invest, it is crucial to consider certain associated risk factors that suggest VF might be a potential value trap.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. It provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. This value is calculated based on historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnpacking the Risks: Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) should not be overlooked. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 2 and Altman Z-score of 1.37. These indicators suggest that VF might be a potential value trap, underlining the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. It is based on nine criteria falling into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/source of funds, and operating efficiency. Higher scores indicate healthier financials. However, VF's current Piotroski F-Score falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Story continuesThe Altman Z-score, invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman, predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: VF Corp (NYSE:VFC)VF designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its portfolio includes brands like Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. It markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalysis of VF's ProfitabilityExamining VF's financial health reveals a concerning decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates a decrease from 7.66% in 2021 to 0.84% in 2023. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in VF.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendAssessing the aspect of leverage, liquidity, and sources of funds, VF demonstrates an alarming rise in its debt-to-total assets ratio over the past three years. The provided data shows an increase from 0.51 in 2021 to 0.56 in 2023. A higher debt ratio suggests that VF is increasingly financing its assets through debt, thereby escalating its financial risk. The Piotroski F-Score views this as a negative indicator, further cautioning investors about VF.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapOperating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, VF follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 53.47; 2022: 54.04; 2023: 52.28 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that VF is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.In terms of operational efficiency, another key indicator, VF has unfortunately reported a declining trend in asset turnover over the past three years, as evidenced by the data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 (expressed in percentages). Asset turnover measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales, and a decrease in this ratio can indicate a drop in efficiency. This could be due to various factors, such as underutilization of assets or a decline in the market demand for the company's products or services. Consequently, this downward trend in asset turnover implies that VF may need to revisit its operational strategies to improve the utilization of its assets and boost its sales volume.ConclusionWhile the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for VF, its current score suggests potential troubles. Coupled with a low Altman Z-score, these factors suggest that VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) might indeed be a value trap. Therefore, potential investors should tread carefully and conduct thorough due diligence before investing.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Piotroski F-score using the following Screener: Piotroski F-score screener .GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to skip details about different kinds of investing strategies, then check out 5 Worst Performing Growth Stocks in 2023. Growth stocks have the potential to deliver strong returns in the future if the economy and their fundamentals allow them to do so. Investors are often on the hunt for such companies since their economic moats can lead to rapid capturing of market share and scaling up of operations to deliver sizeable and stable revenue for a long time period. Most firms that were growth companies in the past but have matured now also pay dividends as a reward to patient investors who have provided capital to the company.The two primary ways in which one can profit on the stock market are either through share price appreciation or dividends. Firms that deliver through the former often operate in sectors with difficult barriers to entry which have prevented others from capturing the market. For dividends, specially structured firms often allow management to pay the maximum amount of earnings as dividends in exchange for tax exemptions. One such category of dividend paying firms is called real estate investment trusts (REIT), with some top dividend paying REITs being American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).The central assumption behind classifying stocks with high price to earnings ratios as growth stocks is the belief in their ability to outperform major stock market indexes. As an example, consider chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD's shares have grown by 65% over the past five years while the S&amp;P500 has grown by 53%, allowing the semiconductor firm that was once unable to turn a profit to outpace a collection of well performing stocks. AMD's high price to earnings ratio before it became profitable proved to be correct, as investors had evaluated the share price as indicative of a firm able to significantly grow earnings per share before it was profitable. Their reward was a 12% premium to the S&amp;P500's returns.Story continuesThese days, the stock market is testing the waters to see how well the broader U.S. economy and the global economy can withstand big monetary policy shocks and a consumer slowdown. Despite the U.S. stock market offering strong returns, with the start of September, the U.S. dollar has marked some of its fastest gains in history, with the dollar index effectively reversing all losses made since the March 2023 banking crisis. Additionally, the difficulty in controlling inflation has created speculation about central banks having to hold interest rates at high levels for longer time periods. Markets price in future expectations, and the latest ones about the dollar do not tend to bode well for either the stock market or global markets.With the third quarter of 2023 in its third month, stock market returns have started to slow down. The S&amp;P500 is up by 16.56% year to date but the growth slows down to 13.76% over the past six months and turns negative for August. Big tech mega cap stocks haven't performed well either, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) down by 0.1% over the past four weeks and Meta Platforms, Inc.(NASDAQ:META) having lost 2.40% during the same time period. Others such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) have posted modest gains and seen their shares dip and rise as sentiment about economic indicators shifts.Today, we took a look at some of the worst performing growth stocks in 2023, out of which the stocks with the biggest share price drops and highest price to earnings ratio are Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD), National Vision Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:EYE), and HomeStreet, Inc.

Its earnings have remained robust despite high inflation and high interest rates, which often lead to businesses tightening their budgets. A recent example of this trend is Netflix's decision to shift some of its cloud computing operations to data center as it found that the previous reliance on Amazon's AWS was proving to be a bit expensive.As of June 2023, 42 hedge funds out of the 910 surveyed by Insider Monkey had held a stake in the company.

Novavax said the FDA was still reviewing its shot.Keeping up with the latest variants of the ever-evolving coronavirus has been a challenge for public health officials globally since the pandemic began in 2020, with some possessing more worrisome characteristics than others. Vaccines can be formulated to target specific variants. The variants circulating the most widely in the United States right now are subvariants of what is called the XBB lineage of the virus.At issue is whether the CDC advisers will call for targeting specific populations for the new boosters - such as older adults or people with underlying medical conditions - or a campaign with the broader population in mind.""I do think that a broad boosting strategy makes sense,"" said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, adding that while the virus was not causing as many hospitalizations and deaths as before, it is still circulating.CDC Director Mandy Cohen is expected to approve the recommendations issued by the advisers, allowing Americans to get the updated vaccines.COVID infections and hospitalizations have been rising in the United States, Europe and Asia but remain well below previous peaks. U.S. deaths are now relatively low - reported at around 2,000 last month - though the country has experienced 1.1 million COVID deaths since the outset of the pandemic.Story continues""The one group that I am curious to hear the committee's recommendation on is young men, because we do see that, in rare cases, young men can develop myocarditis or related effects,"" Rivers said, referring to a rare condition in which inflammation develops in the middle muscular layer of the heart wall.The first COVID vaccines in 2020 were monovalent, or single-target vaccines, aimed at the original strain of the virus. They were followed by bivalent COVID vaccine booster shots that targeted both the original and the Omicron strains. The new updated shots are again monovalent, targeting what is called the XBB.1.5 variant, as requested by the FDA.""I do think that the XBB.1.5 vaccine will provide better cross protection against the current Omicron variants than the bivalent booster,"" said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.Scientists are also closely watching other Omicron subvariants that are circulating, including the currently dominant EG.5, nicknamed Eris, and the highly mutated BA.2.86 subvariant, that had raised concerns about a resurgence of infections.Kuritzkes said there will be some cross-protection across variants from the updated shots.""It's obviously not the same as giving a shot of whatever the most prevalent current variant is, but that is almost an impossibility, given the speed with which the virus has been evolving,"" Kuritzkes said.Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax have said their updated shots are effective in protecting against the EG.5 subvariant, while Moderna and Pfizer's shots generated strong responses in testing against the BA.2.86 subvariant. Novavax said on Monday it was still testing its vaccine against BA.2.86.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Will Dunham and Caroline Humer)]"

A third vaccine from Novavax remains under review.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the shots for those aged 12 and above, and authorized them for emergency use in children aged 6 months through 11 years. Advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are set to meet on Tuesday to discuss recommendations on who should get the vaccines this year. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said last month she expects the shots to be given annually, but not all doctors agree everyone needs them each year.How is this year's vaccine different from last year?Pfizer with BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax all have created new versions of their COVID-19 vaccines. Unlike last year's booster shot that included the original strain of the virus and the then-dominant Omicron variant, this year's shot targets only XBB.1.5, the predominant variant through most of 2023.The companies have said their retooled vaccines have been shown in early testing to work against newer Omicron subvariants now circulating, including the highly mutated BA.2.86.Should seniors, the immunocompromised and pregnant people get the shot this year?There is broad consensus among doctors that these groups should receive at least an annual COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus because of their elevated risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death. For instance, the British government's vaccine committee said only adults 65 and older and some of these other categories will be offered the shot as they are the most likely to benefit.Should younger, healthy adults get the new vaccine?Many doctors believe the vaccine should be recommended annually for everyone, much like influenza vaccines.Story continuesDr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases specialist and a liaison to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said a simple and straight-forward recommendation is likely best.""If you're six months of age or older, you should get a flu vaccine. Sounds good to me for COVID also,"" Schaffner said.Dr. David Boulware, a University of Minnesota infectious diseases specialist, said he would recommend that healthy adults get the shots. According to research he has published, people who have received booster shots have symptoms that are less severe and shorter-lasting if they get sick.Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania infectious disease expert and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel, said he believes the shots should be recommended annually only for high-risk groups. Studies have not shown the booster shots protect against disease in lower-risk populations, Offit said.Should people suffering with long COVID get the shot?There is some data that suggests that vaccination after infection may contribute to a reduction in long COVID symptoms. Regardless, doctors have said that a second episode of COVID-19 could rekindle prior long COVID or worsen ongoing symptoms, and vaccination could help protect against that.Should children receive a COVID-19 vaccine this year?Opinions vary on the need for the shots in children.University of Minnesota epidemiologist Michael Osterholm said children made up a larger percentage of deaths and hospitalizations among those currently with COVID. Although hospitalizations in general are fairly low, over the past month people ages 17 and under have accounted for around 5-6% of COVID-19 hospitalizations, compared with around 4% on average over the previous two years, according to CDC data.""If parents want to vaccinate their kids, they should be allowed to,"" Osterholm said.Boulware said he believes giving children boosters is unnecessary unless there is an immunocompromised person in the household.The American Academy of Pediatrics said it would make its recommendations after the CDC's advisory committee meets.(Reporting by Michael Erman, Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago and Maggie Fick in London; Editing by Caroline Humer and Will Dunham)]"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Biggest Countries Where You Can Use Google Wallet.The Google WalletAlphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google launched the Google Wallet in July 2022. Digital wallets like the Google Wallet are becoming increasingly popular as they serve to be a convenient alternative to carrying cash, debit, or credit cards to make payments.The original Google Wallet was first introduced in the United States which allowed users to make point-of-sale purchases. A separate app for Android users was then launched, named Android Pay. Finally, both Google Wallet and Android Pay were merged into a unified online payment service Google Pay. Recently in 2022, Google Pay was rebranded as Google Wallet. This digital wallet helps store payment cards or various kinds of passes like loyalty cards, transit passes, event tickets, digital identification cards, and health passes for its users.The Digital Payments Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global digital payment market was valued at $81.03 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20.8% from 2023 to 2030. The market is projected to reach $361.30 billion by 2030.With a rise in the penetration of smartphone technology, digital payments have been common around the globe. These payments are being made both online as well as in-store using digital wallets which store credit and debit card information for buyers. On September 7, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that there were approximately $300 billion worth of transactions on digital wallets such as Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.'s (OTC:SSNLF) Samsung Pay, and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Pay, alone in the United States in recent years. This number has also been projected to grow by more than 150% by 2028.Story continuesCurrently, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Wallet dominate the market. However, there is a need to regulate these giants to enable innovation and free competition in the market. On September 7, Bloomberg reported that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) warned tap-to-pay systems such as Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Wallet to promote open banking, without restricting users from trying new and better payment options. For instance, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) doesn’t allow other payment systems to work on iOS devices. Thus, CFBP is looking into policies that could restrict companies from blocking competitors from penetrating the user base thereby enabling transparent payment transactions.Rising Competition in the Digital Wallet IndustryIn an industry that supports electronic financial transactions, the level of rivalry is intense. Google Wallet is subject to competition from big names such as Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, Payoneer Global Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYO), and PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo.Apple Pay is a payment service provider from the tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It enables users to pay online or in person through a two-factor authentication using face ID, pin, passcode or touch ID. It is readily available for use as soon as the credit or debit card is added to the wallet app on the Apple device. It also has a digital card named Apple Cash which stores the cash users wish to send or receive. In June 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced several new additions to its payment system. This includes a new API that supports transferring funds with Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay. It allows a funds transfer to be requested by the app from the payment provider. Users can select a payment card they wish to receive funds to, from their bank account.Another known mobile payment services provider currently performing well in the market is Payoneer Global Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYO). It is based in New York and helps users with online payments and international fund transfers. Users can send and receive funds using a digital wallet. The received money can be used online or in-store with a Payoneer debit card. On August 8, Payoneer Global Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYO) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.09 and outperformed EPS estimates by 0.05%. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $206.7 million, up 40% year over year, as compared to revenue of $148.2 million in the same quarter last year. Payoneer Global Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYO) has been trying to expand its operations. On August 15, the company reported that Payoneer Singapore Private Limited, a subsidiary of Payoneer Global Inc. (NASDAQ: PAYO), has secured a Payment Institution License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore which will allow it to expand its services related to local or international transfers and issuance of accounts in Singapore with ease.Venmo is an exclusive product from PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). It allows users to transfer money through a mobile app. It is only available for users in the United States who need to connect their bank account with the app or simply get a Venmo Mastercard to make payments. Venmo users are also capable of sending up to $2,999.99 over a week. On July 26, the company reported its partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) under which customers making purchases on the Microsoft store can pay with ‘Venmo Pay Later’. Venmo Pay Later is a service that allows users to make payments in installments thereby enabling a flexible and convenient payment process.Thus, the digital wallet market comprises several payment service providers other than Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Wallet. Some prominent digital wallets include Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, Payoneer Global Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYO), and PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo.Now that we have analyzed the digital wallet industry and what the big players in this market are up to, we can examine the 25 biggest countries where you can use Google Wallet.25 Biggest Countries Where You Can Use Google WalletMethodologyIn order to create a list of the 25 biggest countries where you can use Google Wallet, we carried out extensive research.

(Chesnot / Getty Images)The opening pages of “Elon Musk,” the new doorstop biography from Walter Isaacson, the bestselling chronicler of the great innovative men of modern history, are jarring, especially to anyone expecting to be greeted with plucky tales of unlikely genius.On the first page, we’re told that Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, owner of X (formerly Twitter), and currently the world’s richest man, was born into a land of incredible violence in South Africa, “with machine gun attacks and knife killings common,” where boys have to “wade through pools of blood” on the way to concerts and are sent to wilderness camps that resemble “a paramilitary Lord of the Flies,” per Musk. Young Elon is bullied relentlessly — by his classmates but also by his abusive father — until he grows big enough to fight back.Introducing the 688-page biography this way seems designed to address Musk’s recent turn toward combativeness and cruelty — if not justifying it, then offering a skeleton key to understanding where it’s rooted. But as we learn throughout the book, the Musks are persistent fabulists, prone to embellishment and fabrication, and this becomes the first of many narrative sequences that the reader must consider with an eye to truth versus narrative convenience.Read more: The biggest ideas and pettiest rages in Walter Isaacson's Elon Musk biographyAnd Isaacson’s truth is, above all, selective. Given Musk’s recent coziness with white nationalists and peddlers of junk race science and his ongoing tirade against the Anti-Defamation League, whom he blames (rather than himself) for chasing advertisers from Twitter, it seems startling that nothing in those opening pages touches on his experiences with apartheid. Much of that horrendous violence unfolding in 1980s South Africa was precipitated by a brutally racist government; we discover only that it taught Musk to survive adversity. “My pain threshold is very high,” he tells Isaacson.We do learn that Musk’s Canadian grandfather was involved in a fringe political party with antisemitic views and relocated his family to South Africa because he liked the government better — he is described as harboring “quirky conservative views” — and that Musk’s father is now outspokenly racist. But in a book that goes to great lengths to dissect the transmission of habits and ideas from father and son, Elon is allowed to stay mum.Story continuesSilences like that come to haunt the capacious hull of “Elon Musk” — to the point that they risk drowning out the project altogether.After the burst of violence in the introduction, we move into more familiar territory, led on by Isaacson’s brisk, propulsive prose: Musk is a spacy, lonely outsider who is bright but has trouble making friends. He disappears into video games and science fiction and soon dreams of horizons far beyond his hometown, and sets out to North America with an entrepreneurial spirit in tow. He graduates with a dual degree in physics and economics from the University of Pennsylvania, gets accepted into a PhD program at Stanford, but decides instead to set out into the buzzing startup scene of Silicon Valley.He founds Zip2 with his brother Kimbal, sells it, and makes a lot of money. He founds the first iteration of X.com, merges with PayPal, and makes even more. Initially the CEO of both companies, he’s pushed out of each — in a bit of foreshadowing, Musk is booted from PayPal because of his monomaniacal dedication to the porn-adjacent letter X, as well as the idea that PayPal should try to “take over the world’s financial system.” His dismissal, brought about in a coup led by Peter Thiel and other members of the so-called PayPal mafia, leaves him with a large pool of cash, an ax or two to grind and an aspiration to take on loftier goals.Read more: What drove Elon Musk — onetime Democratic 'fanboy' — to troll progressive politicsHere the limitations of Isaacson’s project are revealed: Musk had pushed some of the worst ideas of his young career. From a business perspective, it seemed his colleagues were correct to oust him, preserve their product and make them all fabulously wealthy in an IPO and later sale to EBay. But here’s Isaacson’s diagnosis: “He was a visionary who didn’t play well with others.” The word ""visionary,"" in this application, is doing a lot of work.The narrative is filled with moments of similar dissonance, with Isaacson quick to praise Musk’s incessant risk-taking after a disaster, or to excuse his rude behavior to underlings as necessary to get things done, or to nod along in prose while Musk announces his latest idea that will transform the world. He does occasionally push back, as when Musk claims the Hyperloop will change everything (“It did not change everything”), but Isaacson mostly accepts Musk’s confident prognostications as gospel.Isaacson — biographer of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Henry Kissinger, Benjamin Franklin — is concerned with the study of world-moving men (and occasionally a woman). What makes innovators tick? What makes them so successful? (In the case of Musk, the prognosis can be summarized as: a large appetite for risk, a willingness to alienate colleagues, a detailed knowledge of industry and science, an ability to process work tasks like an algorithm and a predilection for drawing lessons from video games and “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”)Read more: Elon Musk confirms he and Grimes privately welcomed a third child, Techno MechanicusThis sort of framing may have made sense in the early aughts, when so many were dizzy with optimism that Amazon’s everything store and the iPhone would transform the world for the better. It makes less sense 12 years after “Steve Jobs” — now that we’ve seen the toll the tech giants have levied on society: labor exploitation at Amazon, Uber and, yes, Tesla; misinformation and harassment on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and, yes, Twitter. These costs are almost entirely omitted from the equation of “Elon Musk.”That may be because there is a tacit pact between author and subject in the Isaacson “great man” biography: The author will unearth unflattering personal anecdotes and share stories about the subject’s capacity to be cruel. In exchange, the subject’s greatness will be treated as an assumption, the raison d’etre for the book itself. In honor of Isaacson’s habit of using pithy, memorable phrases to describe a phenomenon, we might call it “the Isaacson Accord.”And so it is in “Elon Musk,” whose subject is described as “a visionary” and a “risk-taking innovator” and, most pointedly, “the one launching us toward Mars and an electric-vehicle future.” Musk’s many fans will surely take those descriptors as a given. But that seems all the more reason to challenge the assumptions. Because the Isaacson Accord turns out to be a devil’s bargain. We get a lot of palace intrigue, well-told anecdotes and some genuine insight into Musk’s familial psychology; but the good stuff almost comes in spite of Isaacson’s constant framing of Musk as a moody but brilliant world-mover.Worse, in exchange for unprecedented access, the Isaacson Accord demands that a lot of the most difficult and pressing questions go unasked and, therefore, unanswered.Isaacson repeatedly says one of Musk’s unparalleled strengths as a manager is his intimate knowledge of the factory floors where his products are made. Yet there is not a single mention of the sweeping allegations of racial discrimination at Tesla’s flagship Fremont factory that resulted in juries finding Tesla liable for millions in damages. Workers of color say they were called the N-word and saw swastikas painted on the bathroom. In 2021, Tesla was ordered to pay $137 million to one employee who suffered racist abuse, though that amount was later reduced.Read more: Walter Isaacson brings 'Elon Musk' to book club this fallLikewise, there is no examination of the union drives at Tesla plants, or the wrongful termination case Tesla lost after firing a worker involved in organizing. In all the discussion of Tesla’s self-driving Autopilot program, there is no mention of the blockbuster revelation from a former engineer that one of the first key promotions of Autopilot was staged, contributing to the false sense of security buyers had in the program.And while a major focus of the book is the impact of Musk’s abusive father and the traits that might have been passed down, Isaacson speeds past any explanation of the falling out with Musk’s trans daughter, Jenna, allowing Musk to file it away as her political views simply having grown too radical. Isaacson does not list her as a source in the book, as her twin brother, and does not say whether he tried to reach out. Musk’s story, about Jenna having succumbed to the “woke mind virus,” stands.No biography can or should be totally comprehensive, but it’s pretty easy to conclude which sorts of topics and conversations Isaacson decided it would be best to avoid altogether. I started “Elon Musk” wondering if the world needed another book positioning Musk as a great man — Ashlee Vance’s book of the same title ably covered many of the same bases — and finished thinking it’s time to retire the entire genre of ""great innovator"" biographies, period.The idea that the future is created by flawed geniuses who happen to accumulate great wealth is outmoded and simplistic, and it encourages a flattened view of how technology is developed and whom it impacts. Just scan the list of sources Isaacson includes in the book: executives, venture capitalists, founders and high-ranking engineers. Yes, Isaacson spoke to “adversaries” like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, but not (at least per the list) to line workers, not to Jenna, not to anyone whose family member died in an Autopilot crash, nor anyone who tried to organize a Tesla plant.The bottom line: This is the story Musk himself wants told. Sure, he might have excluded a handful of the details that proved personally embarrassing, but nothing here challenges the idea that Elon Musk is an all-too-human hero valiantly trying to save humanity from the threats he sees cascading down upon us. It’s the book Musk would have written himself.Sign up for our Book Club newsletter to get the latest Los Angeles book news, events and more. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

To be fair, companies commanding gargantuan market capitalization tend to feature mature and thus slow-rising businesses. However, faced with broader uncertainties, going the established route may be the ideal maneuver.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s basic monetary policy game plan benefits the best large-cap stocks over smaller enterprises. Although he didn’t provide specific guidance, Powell acknowledged that inflation remains stubbornly high. Therefore, interest rate hikes may materialize, quashing near-term hopes of an accommodative policy.That’s not great for growth-oriented startups. However, for the well-established entities, it could be their turn to shine. Let’s take a closer look at the best large-cap stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMarathon Petroleum (MPC)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comA petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) offers one of the most relevant takes among best large-cap stocks.Sure, the broader pivot to electric vehicles presents a long-term headwind for midstream and downstream enterprises like Marathon. Yet, the economic pressures of the moment prevent large-scale adoption, particularly for the lower-to-middle-income crowd.Put another way, Marathon stands to be relevant, perhaps for several years to come. Even better, from a financial perspective, MPC easily qualifies as one of the best large-cap stocks to buy now. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) comes in at 27.1%, above 80.73% of its peers. Yet MPC trades at a lowly trailing-year sales multiple of 0.43X.If that isn’t enticing enough, MPC also trades at a forward earnings multiple of 6.83X. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 8.35X.Story continuesFinally, analysts peg MPC as a moderate “buy”. The high-side price target of $164 implies growth of over 12%.Femsa (FMX)Headquarters of the distributor Coca-Cola FEMSA (FMX) or KOF, a Mexican multinational beverage company. It is the largest Coca-Cola (KO) bottling franchise in the worldSource: Alf Ribeiro / Shutterstock.comTechnically known as Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, Femsa (NYSE:FMX) is a multinational beverage and retail company headquartered in Monterrey, Mexico. Per its public profile, the enterprise represents the largest independent Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bottling group in the world. It also owns the largest convenience store chain in Mexico.Given the exciting (albeit speculative) growth opportunities in the wider Latin America ecosystem, FMX ranks among the best large-cap stocks. Further, Femsa is a beneficiary of the trade-down effect. Under difficult circumstances, people globally cut down their expenditures of expensive discretionary items. However, the products of Femsa are relatively cheap and widely accessible.Financially, Femsa generates strong growth, with sales expanding 53.7% over the past three years. At the same time, the price paid for growth is only 1.36X, lower than the sector median 1.81X. Lastly, analysts peg FMX a moderate “buy” with a $127.75 average price target, implying roughly 15% growth.Nutrien (NTR)A photo of Nutrien's (NTR) website, with a magnifying glass over the logo.Source: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.comCanadian-based Nutrien (NYSE:NTR) is a fertilizer company. Per its public profile, it’s the world’s largest producer of potash and the third-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer. However, the impact to the global food commodities supply chain has not been kind to NTR. Since the start of the year, shares slipped almost 10%. In the past 365 days, they’re down nearly 29%.However, Nutrien arguably makes a case for best large-cap stocks to buy because of its underlying relevance. No matter what, people need to eat. Further, last year’s geopolitical flashpoint sent a clear message that Western nations must take food security seriously. Over time, this framework should benefit Nutrien.For now, investors can take confidence in its three-year revenue growth rate of 28.1%. In addition, Nutrien is consistently profitable, leveraging a trailing-year net margin of 11.07%. In closing, analysts peg NTR a moderate “buy” with a $74.73 price target, implying nearly 16% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Countries that Produce the most Carbon Dioxide Emissions.  Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is an odorless greenhouse gas that is crucial for all life on Earth. However, an excessive concentration of this gas could alter the natural temperature in the atmosphere and exacerbate the issue of global warming.  CO2 emissions have skyrocketed in recent years, driven by a diverse range of factors, from industrialization to agriculture and deforestation. In 2020, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported a significant surge in atmospheric CO2 levels, despite a decline in fossil fuel emissions during the pandemic.  Global carbon dioxide (CO2) levels reached a record high of 422 parts per million (ppm) in August 2023, breaking the previous record of 413 ppm set in 2020.Reducing the Impact of Carbon Dioxide EmissionsThe unprecedented rise in carbon dioxide emissions is a major wake-up call for businesses worldwide. Many companies are now launching carbon offset programs and investing in environmental projects to mitigate their impact on the climate. For example, General Motors (NYSE:GM), the largest automaker in the US, has announced that it plans on becoming carbon neutral by the time 2040 rolls around. The plan will decarbonize the company's entire portfolio by extending to its products and activities in all countries where it operates. General Motors (NYSE:GM) also plans to start producing zero-emissions vehicles and use renewable sources of energy. According to General Motors (NYSE:GM), it is also planning to invest in carbon offsets or credits to cover its residual carbon emissions. Through this endeavor, General Motors (NYSE:GM) aims to minimize the consequences of global warming and give people in polluted cities a chance to thrive. Another company that is working to reduce its carbon footprint is Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which has fully committed to combating climate change. By the year 2050, the company hopes to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.  Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has announced that it is going to be switching to sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2030, which will replace at least 10% of its current jet fuel. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will be purchasing 70 million gallons of sustainable fuel annually in the near future. Story continuesThe Implementation of Carbon Capture TechnologyIn response to the growing imperative to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, some companies are investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology as an efficient way to achieve their goals. One such example is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), an American oil and gas producer, which has announced plans to acquire an air capture technology firm, Carbon Engineering Ltd.The deal has been made for $1.1 billion, with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) planning on setting up around 100 DAC plants in the country to strip CO2 emissions from the air. The captured CO2 can be used to make products such as concrete and plastics, or it can be buried underground. Through this acquisition, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) also hopes to decrease costs and boost its profitability. Another company that has shown confidence in carbon capture technology is Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), a multinational energy company in the US.  The company has invested $318 million in Svante, a carbon capture technology corporation.Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has announced plans to invest $10 billion in lower-carbon projects through 2028. The company has set a target of reducing its carbon intensity by 50% by 2030. The company has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the environment and is open to collaborating with others to expedite progress.Chevron Corp. is investing in renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind power, and carbon capture and storage technology. The company is also a member of the Climate Leadership Council, a group of businesses that are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Chevron Corp.'s investment in carbon capture technology is a major vote of confidence in the technology. It is a sign that major energy companies are taking climate change seriously and are investing in technologies to reduce their emissions.25 Countries that Produce the most Carbon Dioxide EmissionsPhoto by Max Bender on UnsplashMethodologyWe compiled a list of the 25 countries that produce the most carbon dioxide emissions by evaluating CO2 emissions per country. Our ranking was based on three primary metrics: CO2 emissions per capita (metric tons), total carbon emissions, and CO2 emissions per GDP. We collected data on the relevant metrics from different websites. We got CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) from The World Bank, total carbon emissions from World Economics, and CO2 emission per GDP from Climate Watch. CO2 emissions per capita is a metric that measures the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that a country or region emits into the atmosphere per person, expressed in metric tons. It provides an indication of the average environmental impact of each individual in terms of carbon emissions. Total carbon emissions are the cumulative amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other carbon compounds released into the atmosphere by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This metric is a key measure of a region or country's overall impact on climate change. CO2 emissions per GDP, also known as CO2 emission intensity, is a metric that measures the environmental efficiency of an economy. It is calculated by dividing the total CO2 emissions of a country by its GDP. A lower CO2 emissions per GDP indicates a more environmentally efficient economy, while a higher value suggests a greater level of environmental impact for each unit of economic output. We first scored each country on each index from 1 to 25, with 1 indicating the country with the most emissions and 25 indicating the country with the least emissions. We then assigned weights of 0.5 to CO2 emissions per capita, 0.3 to total carbon emissions, and 0.2 to CO2 emission per GDP. Finally, we calculated a composite weighted average of these scores to determine the countries that produce the most carbon dioxide emissions. After the final evaluation of the composite results, the countries were ranked from 1 to 25, with 1 indicating the country with the most carbon dioxide emissions and 25 indicating the country with the least emissions. Below is our complete list of 25 countries that produce the most carbon dioxide emissions.Countries that Produce the most Carbon Dioxide Emissions25. SingaporeCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 7.7 Total Carbon Emissions: 32.5 Final Average Score: 21.7 A 2020 report from Macro Trends found that Singapore had a per capita carbon dioxide emission of 7.69 metric tons. In response, the country pledged to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 35% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. This pledge is in line with the Paris Agreement, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.24. BelgiumCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 7.4 Total Carbon Emissions: 95.74 Final Average Score: 20.5 The crown prince of Denmark, Frederick, has launched a program called Project Greensand, through which the country will store carbon dioxide in the subsoil of the North Sea. This means that greenhouse emissions will be contained 1,800 meters under the ground and monitored closely. 23. NetherlandsCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 7.5 Total Carbon Emissions: 141.03 Final Average Score: 19.3 In 2019, the Netherlands recorded net carbon dioxide emissions of 200 million tons. This prompted the European Union to come up with a national energy and climate plan (NECP). The plan included a goal for the Netherlands to sustainably manage its agricultural soils by 2030 and explore the process of carbon storage. Consequently, in 2023, the Dutch courts granted approval for a huge carbon project, which will help reduce the Netherlands’ greenhouse gas emissions by around 2% in 15 years. 22. PolandCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 7.4 Total Carbon Emissions: 328.59 Final Average Score: 18 In 2021, the Climate Action Progress Report of Poland recorded a surge of 2.7% in greenhouse gas emissions as compared to the levels recorded in 2019. The energy sector was the highest contributor to these emissions with a figure of 43%, followed by the transport sector at 19% and the buildings sector at 16%. 21. LuxembourgCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 12.5 Total Carbon Emissions: 8.35 Final Average Score: 17.5 Given that Luxembourg is a transit country, a majority of its carbon dioxide emissions are a result of the burning of fuels. Moreover, the country depends on energy imports of oil and natural gas. The latter is then used to generate electricity, which leads to an increase in CO2 emissions. 20. PalauCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 8.8 Total Carbon Emissions: -  Final Average Score: 16.7 Palau is on the list of 25 countries that produce the most carbon dioxide emissions for its substantially high release of greenhouse gas. Since the country is a popular tourist destination, it uses a significant amount of fossil fuels. Furthermore, Palau imports the majority of its food from abroad, which leads to an increase in the burning of fuels. 19. Czech RepublicCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 8.3 Total Carbon Emissions: 97.3 Final Average Score: 16.7 A report from the European Commission in 2023 analyzed that the Czech Republic is making progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, it indicated that the country has shown an increasing trend in carbon emissions, as opposed to the overall patterns of emissions in the EU.   18. TurkmenistanCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 10.2 Total Carbon Emissions: 82.99 Final Average Score: 16.12 The Asian Development Bank published an outlook on Turkmenistan in 2023, which outlined that the country is hoping to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Consequently, it is aiming to minimize emissions, especially to prevent the devastating effects of climate change. These include water scarcity, droughts, and heat waves. 17. MalaysiaCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 7.4 Total Carbon Emissions: 256.04 Final Average Score: 16.1 The United Nations Development Program published a report to reveal that Malaysia aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by the year 2030. As of 2019, the country’s CO2 emissions stood at 313.02 million tons and are projected to go as high as 508.7 million tons by the end of 2023. 16. Trinidad and TobagoCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 10.2 Total Carbon Emissions: 36.13 Final Average Score: 16.1 Trinidad and Tobago registers substantially high levels of CO2 emissions on a per capita and per GDP basis. This is mainly due to the country housing a small population and an inefficient use of carbon. Overall, however, a study by the University of Trinidad and Tobago in 2023 revealed that the country generates only 1% of the overall global carbon dioxide emissions. 15. JapanCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 8 Total Carbon Emissions: 1067.4 Final Average Score: 14.7 The EGUsphere Repository in Japan revealed that in 2023, urban areas in the country produced 40% of the overall carbon dioxide emissions. Various sources were cited for the emissions, such as residential facilities, automobile traffic, and thermal power plants. 14. ChinaCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 7.8 Total Carbon Emissions: 11472.39 Final Average Score: 12.3 The people of China are heavily reliant on coal for construction-related activities, as well as the transport sector. Moreover, the energy consumption in the country is relatively high on account of its large population. Consequently, China is on the list of countries with the most carbon dioxide emissions. 13. South KoreaCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 11 Total Carbon Emissions: 616.06 Final Average Score: 12.2 South Korea has recorded an increase in population and industrialization in the last couple of years, which has led to the production of different greenhouse gases and numerous pollutants. Consequently, these factors have contributed to climate change and increased CO2 emissions in the country. 12. CanadaCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 13.6 Total Carbon Emissions: 545.64 Final Average Score: 9.6 In a report titled Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the relevant authorities of the government revealed that CO2 emissions in 2020 reached 678 million tons, which were 1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the country has recorded a 17.2% decrease in per capita emissions since 2005. 11. BruneiCO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita): 21.7 Total Carbon Emissions: 10.48 Final Average Score: 9.6 In 2021, the government of Brunei claimed that it would cut down on carbon emissions by 20% in the next decade. Consequently, it announced the introduction of mandated carbon reporting, which would come with a carbon pricing scheme specifically for the energy sector in the country.    Click to continue reading and see 10 Countries that Produce the most Carbon Dioxide Emissions.   Suggested Articles: 30 Least Polluted Countries in the World25 Most Polluted Cities in the World15 Most Polluting Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman and Pras Subramanian explain the workers' costs-of-living demands, how this strike reflects on President Biden's relationship with unions, and ways transitions to electric vehicles could hurt union workers.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: I'm Joined now by Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian and Rick Newman to dig a bit deeper into the current offers from the auto giants. Hi, there Rick. And Hi, there, Pras. And also just the potential political implications of all this. So Pras, first to you. You're the expert on this. I know you've been following this very closely. We've seen some offers put forward by the large-- all three of the large automakers here in Detroit. How do they compare to each other?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So we just had Stellantis submit their offer on Friday. They've mentioned that they've been working with the UAW over the weekend. And they submitted possibly a second offer, a counterproposal, that's happening today. We don't know the details of that. But as you can see right now, about a 14.5% wage increase for the lifetime of the contract, $6,000 one-time payments for inflation protection, also $4,500 protection inflation protection payment over the next three years, talking about things like improving base pay for part-time workers, improving the acceleration timeline to get to higher wages from six-- from eight to six years.Part of the big thing you're noticing here is the UAW wants the end of tiered contracts, right? And the thing with the kind of the progression is they don't want that. They want they want a 90 days to get to that top wage, right, not eight years. They want COLA benefits or Cost Of Living Adjustments. They want that built into a contract. The problem with automakers is they see that as that could be unlimited.Story continuesWe don't know what inflation could be in the future years. We can't just have an open ended expense. So we want to give you defined $5,000 payment, $6,000 payments. That's what all of them are sort of doing right now, try to get to where the UAW wants. But the UAW has some really strong demands like a defined pension plan for one thing, which is a lot.AKIKO FUJITA: Rick, you know, there's a lot riding on this for President Biden as well, not only because he has said he's the most pro-union president, but also because the UAW hasn't necessarily gone all-in on his reelection campaign. They have withheld the endorsement for the president. What do you think this means politically for this administration and the president if, in fact, negotiations don't reach a resolution and we do, in fact, see a strike?RICK NEWMAN: I think there's a lot more downside than upside here for Biden, given that, even since he's been a candidate in 2019 and 2020, he has thoroughly embraced unions. And he has done things such as in the several of the big bills he has signed, the infrastructure bill, the semiconductor bill, the green energy bill. Many of the requirements for getting the tax subsidies in those deals is that the work has to be done domestically, production has to be done domestically, and it has to be done by union workers.So he has really backed the unions. And the perplexing part about this is, you know, the unions represent only 10% of American workers these days. In the manufacturing sector, where most unionized workers are, it's only about 15% of GDP whereas service, the service industry is 85% 86% of GDP. Almost all GDP is in the service sector. And, you know, ask yourself, when was the last time you heard President Biden saying, we've really got to get behind the service sector and those white collar workers, we've got to rebuild the white collar economy? The answer is never.So he goes around to bridge reopenings and factory groundbreakings, talking about how he's revitalizing the blue collar workforce. It's only 10% of the total labor force. And it's probably never going to be much higher than 10%. So Biden and his people wonder like, why is his approval rating so low even though the economy is doing pretty well? Maybe part of it is he's going around talking to only 10% of the workforce in the United States.So if something goes wrong with this strike and it really does shut down the auto sector, cause car prices to go up even more, I think a lot of people are going to say, hey, those are your guys, Biden. Why aren't you fixing this? And if it goes away, like the UPS strike did, I don't think anybody's going to give him any particular credit.SEANA SMITH: So if we do see a strike, obviously, it sounds like this could pose a huge risk here to Biden in the reelection. But Pras, where talks stand today, the negotiations, the demands, when it comes to the UAW not backing down, what the three automakers, at least, it seems like they're willing to negotiate or agree to at this point, how likely is this strike?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, they're still negotiating. There's a lot of talk happening right now. I spoke to Garrett Nelson of CFRA. And he thinks that, quote, that ""the two sides are miles apart"" and they see a strike happening sooner rather than later. Dan Ives said in a note today, a 15% chance of making a deal. So low-- low consequences there.But I want to address what Rick was sort of talking about here. The reason why the union is so strongly favoring potentially having a tough stance here is because, as the EV build out happens, new EV batteries plants, new EV factory plants, they want to be able to have union representation there. And they want to be able to represent them in big contracts with those new plants. So it's really important for them to actually win today or win this week and then also for the future. So I think that's what's happening right now.And you're right, the economic costs are pretty massive. We had a graphic up there of saying if a 10-day strike happened, it'd be a $5.5 billion hit to US GDP and potentially local economic recessions in the states of Michigan-- Michigan and other states like that are tied to the auto sector.AKIKO FUJITA: So Rick, let's pick up on that point that Pras just made. You know, I'm thinking back to a year ago when the president announced the Inflation Reduction Act. He was very vocal. He said these will be good, you know, paying union jobs. And a year later, there are some questions within these unions about whether, in fact, that promise can be kept in this EV transition.You heard Pras just talk about the potential for if there are wage increases, will prices have to be passed down to consumers? Will that slow the transition? I mean, in the context of this big bet the president has made on the transition to electric, what does it mean if this does hit a snag?RICK NEWMAN: Well, and another factor that you didn't mention, Akiko, is electric vehicles, to make electric vehicles takes fewer workers. So the UAW to some extent is actually opposed to more electric vehicle manufacturing, because they think it will mean fewer unionized jobs. So this is complicated.I mean, we got-- we got the so-called battery belt popping up. That battery belt kind of goes north to south from Michigan all the way down to Tennessee and a lot of states in the South. And, you know, those southern states are almost entirely non-unionized. And for all the talk of the three domestic automakers, we've got a bunch of almost every automaker, including all the foreign automakers, does make cars in the United States. And almost all of those factories are non-union factories. And by the way, Tesla also a non-union company.So I think another factor here for the UAW is they might feel like this is a bit of a last gasp, that they're might within the auto sector has been diminishing. They might have a moment here, because we supposedly have a shortage of workers, a labor shortage. And they might think that the President has their back. The thing is I don't-- I'm not sure Biden will take the union side if it really comes down to it and it gets ugly, because, for Biden to take the union side, you know, then he's dissing the three automakers that he kind of depends on. He's been touting the big three, the Detroit-- they're not that big anymore the Detroit Three, as the ones who are innovating in the electric vehicle space. It's not just them. It's a bunch of others, Tesla included.So Biden is going to face a real uncomfortable choice if this gets ugly. And both sides want him to pick one side.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, and you do wonder if the UAW does, in fact, get the concessions or more concessions than expected, whether that will have a ripple effect, even some of those non-union markets, because we have heard rumblings in Georgia, for example, about pressure against companies like Hyundai to raise those wages. So a lot riding on this. And of course, September 14, the big deadline we are looking out for. Pras Subramanain and Rick Newman, thanks so much for bringing us up to date.]"

Here’s where the Big Three automakers individually stand with the UAW, which has more than 143,000 active members ready to strike if an agreement isn't reached.StellantisProgress? Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares in late July dangled the possibility of relaunching a shuttered Illinois factory if it can be made more competitive. (Carlos Osorio/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Stellantis (STLA) was the last of the Big Three automakers to submit a proposal, sending its offer sheet on Friday.Stellantis — which owns the US brands Dodge, Chrysler, Ram, and Jeep — has put forth an agreement similar to what Ford and GM have submitted, with a couple of wrinkles.For most UAW workers, Stellantis is offering wage increases totaling 14.5% over the course of the contract, which generally lasts four years. This is different than Ford and GM’s approach, which is offering wage increases plus lump sum payments, though it is not known how long it will take Stellantis workers to achieve the full wage increase.These workers will also qualify for a $6,000 one-time “inflation protection payment” in the first year of the contract as well as $4,500 in inflation protection payments over the final three years of the contract. These cost of living adjustments (COLA) are a crucial request on the part of the UAW. However, the union wants COLA built into contracts and not in the form of one-time payments.Ready to rumble: United Auto Workers members at a rally last month near a Stellantis factory in Detroit. (Mike Householder/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)For part-time, or “supplemental,” workers, Stellantis is offering wage increases to a starting rate of $20/hour, up from $15.78/hour, about a 25% bump. For “in-progression” employees, who are on the path toward the highest wage offered by Stellantis, the automaker says it will accelerate the timeline to six years from eight years. (This is also known as a tiered compensation scheme.)Story continuesStellantis said in a statement on Monday morning that it has been negotiating with the UAW over the weekend and has “reached tentative agreements in a number of important areas, including health and safety.""The two teams remain in talks, Stellantis said. The company has received a counteroffer from the UAW.Stellantis said it intends to submit a second proposal later on Monday. The UAW has publicly criticized the proposal for maintaining tiered compensation, not providing enough in terms of wage increases, not adding COLA, and not offering an enhanced profit-sharing proposal, among other things.General MotorsGM (GM) submitted its offer to the UAW on Sept. 7. For UAW workers, GM is offering a 10% increase in wages combined with two 3% lump sum payments for a total of 16% over the life of the contract. In addition, instead of a COLA system, GM has offered a $6,000 one-time “inflation” payment, and a $5,000 inflation protection bonus over the life of the contract.For all employees, GM is offering a one-time $5,500 ratification bonus, which Ford has also offered, but Stellantis has not. GM is saying it will increase entry-level wages for in-progress workers by 56% over time and will raise temp worker wages by 20% to $20/hr. GM says it will also eliminate two “progression steps” for tiered employees, which will reduce the time to achieve maximum wages by 25%, the automaker said.Despite the UAW calling GM’s proposal “insulting,” the two sides are negotiating currently, and will likely push talks to the deadline.Ford""Committed"" to its partnership with the UAW: a Ford dealership in Indianapolis. (Getty Images) (jetcityimage via Getty Images)Ford (F) was the first to submit a proposal to the UAW in the most recent round of talks. The automaker, which has the most UAW workers on its payrolls at 57,000, has said it is committed to US manufacturing and its “partnership” with the UAW.Ford received a counteroffer from the UAW after its initial proposal and offered a counter to that. According to UAW president Shawn Fain, Ford upped its wage increase from 9% to 10%. Ford had offered 6% in lump sum payments as well, but Fain did not say whether these terms changed.In addition to the same $5,500 ratification bonus GM was offering to most workers, Ford also apparently took a year off its six-year progression plan for workers to achieve the maximum wage, going down to five years.Fain did not disclose whether Ford had changed its stance on COLA ($12,000 in cost-of-living “bonuses” over the life of the contract, including $6,000 in the first year, which Fain had called “deficient.”) Ford also said it was increasing starting pay of temp workers to $20/hr, an increase of 20%.What’s next?Tough talker: United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain in July outside the General Motors Factory Zero plant in Hamtramck, Mich. (Paul Sancya/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The union has promised to strike at any automaker who has not agreed to a deal by the Thursday deadline.Most observers are not optimistic about those prospects, especially with the UAW's aggressive posturing. “I told [Big Three CEOs] that if they expected to drag everything out until the final days of bargaining and then try to settle everything all at once, then they were setting themselves up for a strike. I’ve told them repeatedly, Sept. 14 is a deadline, not a reference point,” Fain said in a statement earlier this month.[Read More: For columnist Rick Newman's take on the potential strike, read Biden’s misplaced bet on labor unions]But, threats aside, it’s possible the union would continue working with an automaker if it feels progress is being made toward a deal. The UAW’s strike fund has reached $825 million, a healthy amount. However, the fund would be depleted quickly if the union stopped working at all three automakers at once. It would make financial sense for the UAW to stage its strikes individually — as it has done in the past — based on the progression of talks at each automaker.Conversely, the UAW may press what it sees as labor’s moment in the sun and strike at all three automakers, evidenced by a strong deal made recently by the Teamsters with UPS.Meanwhile, Wall Street is grim.""Our expectations for a strike beginning later this week haven’t changed,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson told Yahoo Finance. ""The two sides remain miles apart on a number of issues and a breakthrough in negotiations appears extremely unlikely.""""If an agreement (slim chance-15% at best we believe) is not reached by this Thursday, September 14th, a strike will then almost certainly occur with the UAW workers walking out,"" Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Monday morning.The financial pain, even from a short strike, would be costly for the autoworkers, the Big Three, and the economy.Consulting firm Anderson Economic Group estimates that a strike at all Big Three automakers by the UAW could result in a $5.6 billion hit to US GDP after only 10 days, and UAW lost wages would total almost $860 million. Furthermore, a short strike could also trigger recessions in auto-dependent states like Michigan.But the wily Fain deflected those critiques with some of his own.""You don’t hear the media wringing their hands over how Big Three profits are driving up the cost of cars,"" Fain said in a video. ""You don’t see big, splashy nightly news segments on how consumers will be impacted by companies choosing to spend billions on executive salaries, stock buybacks, and special dividends. No, you only hear these concerns when the working class stands up and demands a fair share of the value we produce.""Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The last hike of 3.3% to 15.5 cents per share was announced in October 2021. Over the past five years, it increased dividends thrice, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 2.25%.Considering last day’s closing price of $10.87 per share, the company’s current dividend yield is 5.7%.

Also, management does not expect to utilize this program in the current year as part of its 2023 plan to improve its capital position.As of Jun 30, 2023, Huntington had cash and due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits at Federal Reserve Bank of $11.08 billion and total debt (comprising of long-term debt and short-term borrowings) of $16.39 billion.

In 2021, L’Oréal's sales rebounded to 32.29 billion euros.""In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic ... triggered a crisis of supply due to the widespread closure of points of sale which led to an unprecedented, if temporary, decline of the beauty market,"" L’Oréal chairman Jean Paul Agon said following the company's Q4 2020 results. ""L’Oréal has traversed this crisis in the best possible condition and has even grown stronger.""Story continuesOne reason for L’Oréal's dominance has been its edge in the hair care category: It's ""the big gorilla in hair"" compared to rivals, Brown told Yahoo Finance.Estée Lauder, meanwhile, has lost market share in the US to L’Oréal. In the company’s recent earnings call, Estée Lauder president Fabrizio Freda said, “We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior-year period.”Despite losses, Estée Lauder is looking to reaccelerate growth across the globe. The cosmetics giant is looking to innovate across its skin care category, enter new markets, and sell inventory to licensees.However, smaller brands are now starting to enter the fray.""The brands that are innovating and marketing effectively behind that innovation will succeed at it,"" Raymond James senior analyst Olivia Tong told Yahoo Finance. ""And that's the [more] important point rather than the size of the company.""Beauty trends driving the industryA few emerging trends in the beauty industry accelerated during the pandemic.When the demand for cosmetics changed suddenly, brands were forced to adapt and many started offering new products.Entrepreneurs Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloe Kardashian took advantage of the shift in consumer demand and used their influence to manufacture and distribute hand sanitizers through Kylie Cosmetics and face masks through SKIMS and Good American brands.

(David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) (David Dee Delgado via Getty Images)Then, throughout the pandemic, millions of consumers took to online shopping.Consequently, e-commerce has become a major factor for the beauty industry, nearly quadrupling between 2015 and 2022, a McKinsey report found, with its share accounting for more than 20%.According to projections, e-commerce will grow at 12% per year between 2022 and 2027, making it the fastest-growing sales channel for the beauty industry.Another element that gained traction is social media, which played a major role in the pivot to e-commerce.""I think social media has been a big game changer for beauty in general,"" Canaccord Genuity managing director Susan Anderson told Yahoo Finance Live in May. ""I think it's really gotten the consumer engaged in the category.""Although beauty sales are dominated by a handful of players, including prestige and private label collections from retailers such as Sephora and Ulta (ULTA), smaller brands such as ColourPop and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) have been able to remain competitive and amass their own loyal followings, in part due to product innovation and social media.E.l.f. cosmetic products are seen for sale in a store in New York City, June 29, 2022. (Andrew Kelly/REUTERS) (Andrew Kelly / reuters)""What I would say about brands like e.l.f., [and] to a lesser extent ColourPop, is what they’ve really, really done well, is they've taken the innovation and the kind of fashion-forward appeal of Sephora brands and they made it very, very affordable,"" Brown said. ""So they move quickly. They're basically fast fashion for beauty.""Others point out that e.l.f. has created value for consumers beyond its price point by offering quality and convenience.""They are not relying just on being the most inexpensive,"" Tong explained. ""They are spending money behind it. … They care about product quality, advertising, partnering with the retailer, all the things that a lot of companies do, and building an audience for that.""That innovation has been an engine for the industry by leading to incremental sales.""When it comes to cosmetics, it's a lot harder to saturate,"" she said. ""Because I may have 10 lipsticks, but if I love the new formulation or I love the new packaging, I can always find space for 11.""Niko Lopez and Mahi Chaurasia attend Sephora At Kohl's VIP Event at Valley Ranch Kohls on Aug. 8, 2022 in Irving, Texas. (Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images for Sephora at Kohl's) (Richard Rodriguez via Getty Images)'Lipstick effect' props up beautyWhile the US has so far been able to stave off a recession coming out of the pandemic, industry execs have been eyeing consumer spending closely for any signs of weakening.""I think the word of the last 18 months has been resilient to describe the consumer,"" Avondale Asset Management founder Scott Krisiloff told Yahoo Finance in July. ""But still the consumer is very resilient, continues to spend, continues to want to have the experiences that the consumer wants to have.""That has especially been the case in the beauty industry, which historically holds up better than other industries during economic downturns due to what experts call ""the lipstick effect.""According to Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research, the lipstick effect occurs when consumers continue to spend on small luxuries, even as they pull back on spending in other areas.Lipstick represents ""an affordable luxury for consumers that may not be experiencing gains in other places,"" Kodali said. ""It's a way to indulge yourself in an affordable way, and it's something that we see happen in almost any type of economic hardship.""The relative strength of consumers has given companies the confidence to make major M&amp;A deals even in an uncertain economic environment, a positive sign for the industry overall. ""The growth in beauty has been built on effective or strategic acquisitions,"" Brown said.In recent decades, M&amp;A has become a core part of L’Oréal’s growth strategy.In April, L’Oréal acquired Australian skin care brand Aesop in a deal that valued Aesop at $2.5 billion. It marked L’Oréal's largest acquisition to date aimed at helping the beauty giant expand its presence in the luxury market and in China, the second-largest beauty market behind the US.In addition to M&amp;A, more beauty brands have looked to expand through brand partnerships with major retailers.In the second quarter, Target (TGT) executives highlighted double-digit growth in the beauty category, driven by in-store Ulta locations, known as shop-in-shops. Department stores such as Macy’s (M) continued to see outperformance from prestige beauty brands such as Estée Lauder. And Sephora locations in Kohl's (KSS) stores offered a bright spot for the retailer.""Sephora at Kohl's continues to exceed our expectations, driving a total beauty sales increase of nearly 90% year over year,"" Kohl's CEO Thomas Kingsbury said in the company's second quarter earnings call. ""We opened nearly 200 Sephora shops in the quarter, and momentum in our existing Sephora shops continues to accelerate with greater than 20% comparable beauty sales growth in the Sephora shops opened in 2021 and 2022.""While some retailers warned that consumers may be growing more cautious, shoppers are still invested in spending across beauty, hair, and skin care.""There isn’t really a slowdown in sight,"" Brown said. ""I don't see the appetite for beauty products changing.""—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the robotics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Robotics ETFs.The robotics industry is currently experiencing significant transformations due to various trends, such as the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the emergence of autonomous and collaborative technologies. These trends are driving the alliance between AI and robotics, resulting in a powerful synergy. According to Mordor Intelligence, the size of the robotics industry stood at $114.7 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% to reach $258.4 billion by 2028. The robotics industry can be broadly divided into two categories. The first category consists of industrial robots that are used in manufacturing, assembly, packaging, inspecting, and testing across industries like automotive, electronics, metals, plastics, and chemicals. The industrial robotics segment holds a substantial share, accounting for 91% of the total robotics industry. In 2023, the industrial robotics industry was valued at approximately $104.65 billion. Over the next six years, it is predicted to expand at an average annual rate of 7.9% to reach a market size of $165.4 billion.The second category is service robots that assist humans in non-industrial tasks, providing services in areas like logistics, domestic work, healthcare, hospitality, agriculture, defense, and space. Several factors have driven the growing demand for service robots in recent times. Increases in labor costs due to shortages, inflation, and other factors like aging populations requiring assistive robots have accelerated the adoption of service robots. Service robots have also come to the forefront in the fields of sanitation, deliveries, and telemedicine.Investment OutlookCurrently, the top three sectors driving the adoption of robotics are the medical field, domestic services, and the entertainment industry. Together, these three industries are responsible for 58.4% of the total top line. Due to a strong demand outlook across various sectors, significant investment is being made in the robotics industry. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), there has been a surge in the demand for robotics in new production facilities within the automobile industry. A significant investment of nearly $16 billion was made in the robotics industry in 2022. Furthermore, the total number of industrial and service robots stood at 4.27 million in 2022. This figure is expected to compound at an average rate of nearly 2.2% to reach 4.83 million by 2028.Story continuesSome of the best robotic stocks, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH), provide investors and hedge funds with significant investment opportunities in the industry. In addition to individual stocks, Global X Artificial Intelligence &amp; Technology ETF has remained the best-performing ETF in the last five years. Retail investors also refer to it as Vanguard Artificial Intelligence ETF or Vanguard Robotics ETF. The iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF is also noteworthy for delivering healthy returns to investors.

These ETFs provide exposure to companies engaged in robotics, automation, and related themes. The ETFs have been ranked in ascending order of their 5-year performance.10 Best Robotics ETFs10. ALPS Disruptive Technologies ETF (NYSEARCA:DTEC)5-Year Performance as of September 8, 2023: 27.3%Total Net Assets as of September 8, 2023: $103.1 millionExpense Ratio: 0.50%Number of Holdings: 98ALPS Disruptive Technologies ETF (NYSEARCA:DTEC) is focused on mimicking the performance of the Indxx Disruptive Technologies Index (IDTEC), which encompasses various disruptive thematic areas, including robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). The fund was created in December 2017.The ETF has allocated 9.2% of its holdings towards the robotics and AI theme. Some of the other themes, like 3D printing and healthcare innovation, provide indirect exposure to the robotics industry as well. Leading robotics companies like iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  (NASDAQ:ISRG) are amongst the top 10 holdings of the ALPS Disruptive Technologies ETF (NYSEARCA:DTEC).Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  (NASDAQ:ISRG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG): ISRG shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite 4Q results largely in line with expectations. The company used the quarterly release to define the timeline of upcoming products including its next-gen platform, now expected next year. The market was disappointed by this timing.Intuitive is the pioneer and clear leader in robotic surgery and remains one of our most compelling long-term growth opportunities. The company’s products address a massive market with very low current penetration, and the company has a strong moat. Its major competitors, J&amp;J and Medtronic, are facing large delays (to at least 2024) in introducing their platforms as the FDA approval process has become more difficult. These delays give Intuitive more time to place systems, train surgeons and launch new products, extending its competitive advantage. The company’s “Extended Use Program” aims to make its tools more price-competitive to traditional non-robotic procedures, which increases the company’s moat.”9. Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSEARCA:ROBO)5-Year Performance as of September 8, 2023: 29.4%Total Net Assets as of September 8, 2023: $1.39 billionExpense Ratio: 0.95%Number of Holdings: 78Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSEARCA:ROBO) seeks to duplicate the performance of the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index.

As of September 8, Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) and Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) are two of the most prominent robotics companies in the ETF’s portfolio.Here’s what RGA Investment Advisors said about Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“This question as to whether anything has structurally changed is as applicable to e-commerce as it is to 2022’s most talked about economic datapoint: the CPI. Before the pandemic, people would speak about “secular stagnation” and the strong disinflationary forces that kept the economy from experiencing a robust post-Great Financial Crisis recovery. Today, we are far more likely to hear about stagflation than “secular stagnation”, yet the economy is growing faster today than it was in the past. We must therefore ask ourselves, what are the biggest changes from before the pandemic to now that would change our economic outlook from disinflation to inflation. The largest change is what people now call “The Great Resignation” whereby Boomers who entered the workforce in the 1970s finally retiring en masse.[3] This can have consequences for wages, though we would caution against fearing a wage price spiral as underinvestment in efficiency due to an overabundance of labor during the past decade can finally commence with lower levels of fear for labor unions and politicians alike. In fact, investments in productivity might even be encouraged now with fears of inflation front-and-center. As we have pointed out several times in the past, Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) stands to benefit considerably from this change.”In addition to Robo Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (NYSEARCA:THNQ), individual stocks such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) are among the best robotics stocks. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Robotics ETFs. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs China Stocks: Top 10 Stock Picks10 Best Mining ETFs13 Best Stocks To Invest In According to AIDisclosure: None. 10 Best Robotics ETFs is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:ISRG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-140115345.html,1694440875.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) recent performance, when its stock has declined 5.5% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Intuitive Surgical's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Intuitive Surgical's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 9.2%. This certainly adds some context to Intuitive Surgical's decent 8.1% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 9.3% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intuitive Surgical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about CSX. See our latest analysis for CSX ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CSX?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.CSX already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of CSX, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in CSX. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of CSXThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of CSX Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$168m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over CSX. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

One such stock that merits attention is Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE:RCL). The stock, which is currently priced at 95.27, recorded a loss of 2.14% in a day and a 3-month increase of 4.56%.

On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnmasking the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Royal Caribbean Group should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.68, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Royal Caribbean Group a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that Royal Caribbean Group, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesDecoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company SnapshotRoyal Caribbean is the world's second-largest cruise company, operating 64 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation industry, with 10 more ships on order through 2026. Brands the company operates include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea. The company also has a 50% investment in a joint venture that operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, allowing it to compete on the basis of innovation, quality of ships and service, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations, and price.Is Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnpacking Royal Caribbean Group's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Royal Caribbean Group's Altman Z-score reveals Royal Caribbean Group's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Royal Caribbean Group's historical data, 2021: 0.09; 2022: -0.04; 2023: -0.04, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Royal Caribbean Group's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Royal Caribbean Group, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 49.40; 2020: 37.74; 2021: 0.37; 2022: 18.37; 2023: 45.71; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-21.4%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Royal Caribbean Group's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Royal Caribbean Group's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Royal Caribbean Group's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionGiven the combination of Royal Caribbean Group's low Altman Z-Score, declining revenues, and earnings, it appears that the company might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors are advised to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. The seemingly attractive valuation might be overshadowed by the underlying risks associated with the company's financial health and performance.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Royal Caribbean (RCL).Royal Caribbean currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.64, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.64 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for RCLBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for RCLCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Royal Caribbean here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Royal Caribbean, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is RCL Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Royal Caribbean, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $6.02.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Royal Caribbean.

Goldman found stores with lower-income consumers (those with household incomes from $62,000 to $85,000) saw same-store sales increase 5.6% compared to last year in the second quarter. Those stores include the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Ross Stores (ROST), as well as dollar store chains Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Five Below (FIVE).On the other end, retailers with higher-income consumers (median income between $96,000 and $128,000) saw same-store sales decline 2.2%. Those stores included Bloomingdale's (M), RH (RH), Lululemon (LULU), and Nordstrom (JWN).The analysis fell in line with credit card data Goldman Sachs tracks that showed consumer spending has increased 25% since the start of the pandemic in lower-income zip codes. Meanwhile, spending in middle-income (+22%) and higher-income zip codes (+16%) has increased at a slower pace.Goldman Sachs expects this gap to narrow a bit during the current quarter and through the end of the year as other macro headwinds weigh on the consumer.""One key question is whether management guidance appropriately embeds the expected drag from resuming student loan payments, which we expect will weigh on upcoming retail sales and consumer spending reports,"" Hill wrote.Same-store sales in lower-income stores have been more resilient than those in higher-income stores this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs.In August, Bank of America released an analysis of its card spending data from the start of the year through July. The data showed higher-income spending had been weaker than lower-income spending on a month-over-month basis for four of the first seven months of the year. BofA attributed part of that divergence to the labor market where higher-income individuals are seeing wages increase at a slower pace while more of the cohort is applying for unemployment benefits.Story continuesInvestors will get another update on consumer spending Thursday with the August retail sales report slated for release. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect retail sales increased 0.1% in August, a noted decrease from the 0.7% jump seen in July.CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MAY 18: Customers shop at a Walmart store on May 18, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.

The merger deal, which is likely to close in early 2024, will help the combined entity to firm its position in the competitive grocery space. The combined entity would benefit from a loyal customer base, digital investments, increased purchasing power and a broader product portfolio. The transaction is likely to boost Kroger’s strategy of Leading with Fresh, Accelerating with Digital, thus enabling the new organization to support its go-to-market strategy comprising Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless.The divestiture deal is in sync with the commitments made by Kroger and Albertsons in the merger agreement.

It will also ensure that there will be no store closures as a consequence of the Kroger-Albertsons merger and all frontline associates will remain under the service.The divestiture will involve 413 stores, 8 distribution centers, 2 offices and 5 private label brands across seventeen U.S. states and the Columbia district. The deal will also involve Kroger divesting the Debi Lilly Design, ReadyMeals, Primo Taglio, Open Nature and Waterfront Bistro private label brands. It will also include the selling of QFC, Mariano's and Carrs brand names.As noted, the deal will include the divestiture of 104 and 66 stores in Washington and California, respectively. In Colorado, 52 Albertsons stores and in Oregon, 49 Albertsons and Kroger stores will be divested. Other stores included in the divestiture agreement are located in several states, including Arizona, Nevada, Texas, Illinois and others.With regard to the divestiture, Kroger will receive about $1.9 billion in cash from C&amp;S, subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory clearance, other customary closing conditions and the completion of the Kroger-Albertsons merger.Kroger may also require C&amp;S to acquire up to another 237 stores in certain geographies to secure FTC and other governmental clearance related to the proposed merger. If these stores are acquired, Kroger will receive an additional cash consideration from C&amp;S.Story continuesWhat’s More?Separately, Kroger also announced its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line beat the same. In the quarter, Kroger posted adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents and increased from 90 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Including a $1.4 billion charge related to a nationwide opioid settlement framework, the company reported a loss of 25 cents per share.Total sales of $33,853 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34,251 million.

A resilient business model enables it to gain market share and generate profits. This operator of membership warehouses has exhibited a decent run on the bourses and has outpaced the industry year to date. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have appreciated about 20.7% year to date compared with the industry’s rise of 2.2%.With a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.8% and a VGM Score of B, Costco has ample scope to attain new highs. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.7% and 9.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.Striking the Right Chord With ConsumersCostco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. A customer-centric approach, strategic pricing, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on memberships have helped Costco post consistent sales growth.Costco’s net sales increased 5% to $18.42 billion for the retail month of August from $17.55 billion last year. This followed an improvement of 4.5% witnessed in July. Comparable sales for the retail month of August — the four-week period ended Aug 27, 2023 — increased 3.4%. This followed an increase of 2.5% registered in July.Costco has emerged as a viable option for bargain hunters looking for essentials and other discretionary purchases amid soaring inflation. We believe a growing customer base and high renewal rates should fuel sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSteadily Adopting the Omnichannel MantraCostco is gradually adopting the omnichannel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics — has boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.Story continuesEnhancing FootprintCostco’s expansion strategy looks pretty impressive. The company remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. In our view, Costco’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets.As of Aug 30, 2023, Costco operates 861 warehouses, including 591 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 33 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 18 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, five in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.We foresee improvement in membership fees as new warehouse openings ramp up. Membership fees increased 6.1% to $1,044 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Costco ended the quarter with 69.1 million paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders.Enough LiquidityCostco’s sturdy balance sheet equips it to deal with cyclical downturns and tap growth opportunities. Solid cash flow generation allows it to raise dividends consistently. The company’s cash &amp; cash equivalents (including short-term investments of $1,215 million) were $13,708 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Costco has always been a favorite pick for investors who are seeking both steady income and growth. This Issaquah, WA-based company, with a strong history of dividend payments as well as sound fundamentals, provides a hedge against any odd swings in the stock market.3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Grocery Outlet GO, Ross Stores ROST and Walmart WMT.Grocery Outlet, an extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products, currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAssessing Risks with Marathon Digital HoldingsDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Marathon Digital Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.16. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewMarathon Digital Holdings Inc focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The Company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. The Company's Cryptocurrency Machines are located in the United States.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapBreaking Down Marathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Marathon Digital Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The first factor we need to consider is a measure of short-term liquidity. This is calculated as the working capital divided by total assets. When we evaluate the data provided: 2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00, it's clear that Marathon Digital Holdings has experienced a declining trend in its Working Capital to Total Assets ratio over the past few years. This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. The ratio is strikingly low, which unfavorably influences the overall Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Marathon Digital Holdings's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionBased on the analysis above, it becomes apparent that while Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) may seem undervalued at first glance, the underlying financial health of the company suggests it may be a potential value trap. This highlights the importance of conducting thorough due diligence before making investment decisions. It's not just about the price, but the intrinsic value and financial stability of the company that matters most.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The French sugar beet crop area fell to a 14-year low this year.Story continuesEuropean sugar was trading at 915 euros ($983.17) per ton on July 2023, the most recent EU data showed, up 57% on the previous year and twice the price recorded in July 2021.""We must be careful not to fall into the opposite extreme,"" Franck Sander, chairman of French sugar beet union CGB, told Reuters, warning that a rise in area could make EU prices slump.""A turnaround could happen very quickly, prices could fall 30%, especially since there are large supplies in Ukraine.""Saint Louis Sucre closed two factories in 2019 as part of a wider restructuring plan at Suedzucker, Europe’s largest sugar refiner. It still has two in northern France.The European Union's sugar output is expected to rebound in 2023/24 from the previous year, mainly due to a larger crop in Poland where farmers, attracted by higher prices, had boosted the area sown.($1 = 0.9307 euros)(Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide, additional reporting by Nigel Hunt in London and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

Overall, the company expects 2023 net rooms to grow in the range of 6.4-6.7% on a year-over-year basis.Digitization Initiatives: Digital innovation and social media are playing important roles in hotel bookings and Marriot isn’t far behind in improvising.

It is resizing operations to ensure that resources better serve core businesses. In the first six months of 2023, SWK generated pre-tax run-rate savings of $460 million from its global cost-reduction program. The company expects to generate run-rate savings of $1 billion from this program in 2023. By 2025, the company expects run-rate savings of $2 billion.The company’s commitment to handsomely reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging.

The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space are expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and stiff competition continue to concern the company.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 22.7% against the 6.8% decline of the industry it belongs to. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 8.7% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device outsource manufacturer has a market capitalization of $2.68 billion. The company projects 12.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Integer Holdings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 8.4%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Improving Non-Medical Sales: We are upbeat about Integer Holdings’ improvement in its Non-Medical sales. In the second quarter of 2023, revenues at the Non-Medical Sales segment rose 6.7% year over year both on a reported and organic basis. This was driven by strong demand in military and environmental market segments.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Strong Q2 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust second-quarter 2023 results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust results by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were recorded. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin was also seen.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: Competition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Many other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: Integer Holdings’ business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials, which may be susceptible to fluctuations due to transportation issues, government regulations and price controls, among others. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, which cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of the company’s products, could adversely affect its operating results.Estimate TrendInteger Holdings is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 4.3% north to $4.33 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $374.2 million, suggesting a 9.2% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and McKesson Corporation MCK.DaVita, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

In fact, according to analysts at Strategic Market Research, the market could be worth $75.72 billion by 2030. By 2050, analysts at Deloitte say it could be worth $1.4 trillion by 2050. All of which could have a big impact on the hydrogen stocks we’ll mention below.Deloitte explains that green hydrogen will proliferate widely because it’s an important means of reducing carbon emissions. In addition, the firm went on to explain that if we are to meet net-zero compliance by 2050, the world will need “Over US$9 trillion of cumulative investments in the global clean hydrogen supply chain.”That being said, investors may want to consider taking a position in the following hydrogen stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHydrogen Stocks: Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockThe latest earnings-induced pullback in Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) may be a buying opportunity.Granted, the company’s net loss increased to $236.4 million, or 40 cents a share from a loss of 30 cents, year over year. However, revenues did rise about 72% year over year to $260.2 million. And, despite the losses, the company has said it has “clear short-term goals to improve profitability in the second half of 2023 and position additional cost-down initiatives through 2024 as we significantly ramp sales volumes.” So, all is not lost here. Helping, the company reiterated its full-year revenue guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, which is in line with expectations. Also, let’s not forget that the global hydrogen electrolyzer market – valued at $350.6 million in 2021 – could be worth about $3.7 billion by 2032, as noted by Future Market Insights.In addition, analysts at Jefferies just assumed coverage of Plug Power with a buy rating, with a price target of $12 per share.Linde (LIN)Linde (NYSE:LIN) is “the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the U.S.,” and is looking to exploit the green hydrogen boom. Specifically, the company at the beginning of this year announced that it was launching “several green hydrogen projects it is planning across the U.S.,” as noted by Seeking Alpha. By the end of next year, Linde says that its green hydrogen production will allow it “to avoid up to 75K metric tons/year of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.”Story continuesWith earnings, the company just posted Q2 EPS of $3.57, which beat expectations by nine cents. It also increased its full-year 2023 adjusted EPS to a range of $13.80 to $14, which is about 12% to 14% growth year over year. Revenue of $8.2 billion unfortunately missed estimates by $500 million. But analysts are still upbeat, with many raising their price targets. That includes Barclays, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Mizuho, BMO Capital, and HSBC.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) appears to be Saudi Arabia’s key partner when it comes to hydrogen. As I noted in a previous column, APD launched a joint venture in the region to create ”650 tons per day” of green hydrogen.Moreover, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund reported that it owned 2.75 million shares of APD stock as of the end of Q2, up from 2.7 million at the end of Q1. The Saudis obviously have big plans for APD in the hydrogen space. And given the country’s vast wealth, they can spend huge amounts making sure that APD has sufficient funds to become a huge player in green hydrogen. Analysts at Mizuho appear to like the APD stock here, too. The firm just raised its price target to $330 from $322 a share. BMO Capital also reaffirmed a buy rating on the APD stock, with a target price of $365 a share.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer was long PLUG. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

Robinson said a new facility in Laredo, Texas, has the capacity to handle as many as 350 shipments a day. (Photo: C.H. Robinson)As nearshoring expansion in Mexico continues to create booming demand for border logistics facilities, brokerage giant C.H. Robinson has opened a 400,000-square-foot cross-border facility in Laredo, Texas.The facility includes 154 dock doors and room for 700 trailers, while expanding the company’s footprint along the U.S.-Mexico border to 1.5 million square feet of logistics space.Mike Burkhart, C.H. Robinson’s vice president of North America surface transportation, said Mexico’s value proposition as a reliable and attractive manufacturing location is the strongest he’s ever seen.“[C.H. Robinson] has been operating in Mexico for over 30 years, and right now without a doubt this is the most interest we’ve seen in Mexico,” Burkhart told FreightWaves. “Nearshoring is attracting all kinds of manufacturing to the country, and it’s really just starting, because a lot of the factories are still under construction and haven’t even come online yet.”Nearshoring to Mexico has soared since 2020, boosted by declining U.S.-China trade relations and shifting global supply chains caused by the pandemic.Northern Mexican states such as Nuevo Leon have attracted about $25 billion in foreign direct investment in recent years, including Tesla’s planned $5 billion electric vehicle factory near the city of Monterrey.Burkhart said Laredo’s proximity to Monterrey was a key factor in the expansion in Laredo. The two cities are about 140 miles apart.“Manufacturing, nearshoring around Monterrey is booming, especially automotive,” Burkhart said. “Opening this facility in Laredo so close to Monterrey gives [C.H. Robinson] major capacity and opportunities. I think a lot of the locations along the Mexico border will see growth because of nearshoring, but Laredo’s location … near Monterrey, Queretaro and other major central [Mexican] cities gives it an advantage over others.”He said one of the unique things about the company’s new distribution center in Laredo is that it has dock doors on both sides of the facility, which helps accelerate the transfer of freight from Mexican carriers to U.S. carriers.Story continuesWhen freight is shipped from Mexico to the U.S. via truck, it typically takes three trucks to bring a shipment through Laredo, Burkhart said.“A Mexico carrier brings the trailer to the border, a Mexico transfer carrier takes it across, then the freight is unloaded and reloaded onto a U.S. carrier’s trailer,” he said. “Because our cross-dock is significantly larger than most … we can immediately unload freight when it arrives.”C.H. Robinson’s distribution center aims to handle as many as 350 shipments a day, and the facility’s size will help speed up freight flows through Laredo, Burkhart said.“On a day when 350 loads are being picked up, if you reduce load time by an average of 10 minutes, that saves nearly 60 hours in one day,” Burkhart said.In addition to C.H. Robinson, Laredo has seen several other freight and trucking firms open or announce new facilities in recent months.Truckload broker RXO opened a $30 million, 127,000-square-foot facility in Laredo in April. The warehousing and distribution center features 43 dock doors and parking for 160 trailers.In May, Pennsylvania-based carrier PGT Trucking began construction of a new trucking terminal in Laredo. The facility will be on a 7.7-acre site and feature an operations center, driver amenities and a truck maintenance shop, providing a regional base for over 70 local drivers.

(NYSE: CMI), a global power solutions provider and Terex® Advance, leading manufacturer of front-discharge concrete mixer trucks, announced today the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) to integrate Cummins’ X15H hydrogen internal combustion engines into the Terex Advance Commander Series.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230911033897/en/Cummins X15H Hydrogen Engine (Photo: Business Wire)""As the global need to reduce emissions becomes stronger, we are actively pursuing practical, cost-effective strategies to help our ready-mix customers decarbonize. Cummins’ X15H is a feasible zero-carbon option for our renowned front-discharge mixer trucks, and we are eagerly anticipating the future deployment of this technology,"" said David Grabner, General Manager at Terex Advance.Currently powered by Cummins diesel engines, the Terex Advance Commander Series will include a zero-carbon hydrogen fuel option when series production of Cummins’ X15H engines begins later this decade.""Hydrogen internal combustion engines provide a viable zero-carbon fuel option for heavy-duty, high-performance applications like concrete mixer trucks, which are often subject to arduous duty-cycles and tough terrain. It is exciting to see OEMs like Terex Advance leading the way in zero-carbon technologies, particularly in complex sectors like vocational trucking,"" said Jim Nebergall, General Manager, Cummins Hydrogen Engine Business.Part of Cummins’ industry-first fuel agnostic platform, the X15H is based on familiar internal combustion engine technology. Integration into the truck chassis is straightforward and does not require major overhaul of vehicle designs or business operations.

To this end, Ford presented a contract offer to the UAW last to last week after the union called Detroit Three automakers to come up with counterproposals. However, Ford’s proposal fell short of UAW’s expectations.

Furthermore, the proliferation of smartphones and smart TVs has made it easier than ever for users to access streaming services from virtually anywhere. Additionally, the industry's expansion into original content production and exclusive licensing deals has been a significant driver of its success. Remarkably, approximately 57% of U.S. consumers subscribe to streaming services primarily to access this unique content. The major players in the video streaming industry The video streaming industry has seen significant growth in recent years, with major players investing heavily in content creation and technological advancements.  Netflix, Inc.

The company recently introduced an advertising-supported membership plan that should enable it to augment revenue growth by tapping into the growing market for digital advertising while not cannibalizing its existing subscriptiononly plans. In addition, the company has recently implemented password-sharing restrictions, suggesting that the conversion of former password sharers to paying subscribers is tracking much better than expected. Netflix has led the transition from traditional linear TV to streaming and remains the dominant platform globally.”Following in the footsteps of Netflix, the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+, yet another major player in the streaming industry, has also revealed plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription tier. While the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has faced recent financial challenges, CEO Robert Iger provided insightful commentary on Disney+'s performance during the latest the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s earnings call.

Elsewhere, British chip designer Arm will reportedly stop taking orders for its much-anticipated initial public offering a day early due to solid investor demand, while Disney and Charter Communications reach a distribution deal to end a TV blackout that threatened to leave millions of households unable to tune in to the first ""Monday Night Football"" game of the season.1. Futures slip after positive day on Wall StreetU.S. stock futures fell on Tuesday, pointing to a lower open after a positive day on Wall Street that featured a surge in shares of electric carmaker Tesla.At 05:53 ET (09:53 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 56 points or 0.2%, S&amp;P 500 futures lost 11 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped by 42 points or 0.3%.The three main indices rose on Monday. Fueling the upticks were Tesla shares, which gained more than 10% after analysts at Morgan Stanley suggested that the company's Dojo supercomputer could give it access to new opportunities beyond ""selling cars at a fixed price."" The analysts added that the Elon Musk-led business may see its market value jump by $600 billion thanks to the technology.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) also announced that it had extended a deal to supply 5G chips to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) until 2026, sending shares in the U.S. semiconductor designer higher by almost 4%.Looming in the background for equity markets is a slate of major U.S. economic data this week that includes a fresh look at inflation and retail prices. The figures will likely inform whether the Federal Reserve chooses to push on with an aggressive monetary policy tightening campaign later this year.2. Arm to close IPO order book a day early - reportsStrong demand for chip designer Arm's initial public offering has pushed the banks underwriting the highly-anticipated listing to stop taking orders a day earlier than originally planned, according to various media reports.Story continuesSources familiar with the matter told the Financial Times and Bloomberg News that the order book will close by Tuesday afternoon, with the reports suggesting that the IPO is already anywhere from over five to 10 times oversubscribed. Arm declined to comment to both news outlets.Arm still reportedly intends to price its shares on Wednesday, with the figure potentially near the top end of -- or even higher than -- its initial range of $47 to $51. At the top end of this band, the company's fully diluted market value could touch $54.5B.The reports would suggest that investors are widely unperturbed by a fall in Arm's profits over the last quarter or the firm's warning that it is ""susceptible"" to trade tensions between the U.S. and China.3. Apple expected to unveil new iPhone modelApple is set to announce the latest version of its flagship iPhone at its annual fall hardware update in California later today.The event will feature four new models of the ubiquitous device, according to sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ added that the gadgets, which are expected to be called the iPhone 15, will include two base models and two higher-priced advanced versions.Despite a dip in iPhone revenues in Apple's most recent quarter, the smartphone remains massively important, making up about half of the group's total sales.But the iPhone may be facing looming headwinds. Along with a slump in the global smartphone market, reports last week said that China has ordered government officials to stop using iPhones for work, stoking concerns over the gadget's future in the country. Analysts have also flagged that a new device from Huawei could threaten Apple's hold on China's market for high-end smartphones.4. Oil prices move higherOil prices rose Tuesday, with Brent crude futures holding above $90 a barrel, as markets awaiting the release of the OPEC oil producer group's monthly report later in the session.Traders are particularly on the lookout for OPEC's forecasts for China's oil market, as expectations that the country will drive demand to record highs this year dwindle. Industry data on U.S. crude stocks from the American Petroleum Institute are also due later today, and are expected to continue a recent run of draws.By 05:54 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $87.96 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.6% to $91.21. Last week, Brent touched a level above $90 a barrel for the first time in 10 months on news that Saudi Arabia and Russia had extended their voluntary supply cuts until the end of the year.5. Disney and Charter reach deal to end ESPN, ABC blackoutShares in Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) were mostly unchanged in premarket U.S. trading on Tuesday after the two companies forged a distribution deal that ended a blackout of popular channels like ESPN and ABC.Under the terms of the agreement, Disney will give select subscribers to Charter's pay-TV service Spectrum access to its advertising-supported Disney+ streaming offering. ESPN+, the entertainment giant's sports-based streaming service, will also be made available to Spectrum customers with more premium subscriptions. Charter will pay Disney higher rates to carry its TV channels in return.The deal, which was announced on Monday, came just hours before a highly-touted National Football League game between the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills was due to be televised on ESPN. Millions of households may not have been able to watch the match-up if an agreement had not been reached.The stand-off between Charter and Disney was largely seen as an example of the strained relations between pay-TV firms and entertainment companies during an era of increasing demand for streaming services. In a joint statement, both companies hailed the agreement as ""transformative"" and an ""innovative model for the future.""Related ArticlesU.S. futures slip; Disney, Charter reach distribution deal - what's moving marketsWealthy families pile into bonds, private equity while shedding stocks - CitiFutures dip as investors await key inflation data]"

OPEC's monthly report forecast world oil demand will rise by 2.25 million barrels per day in 2024.The Paris-based International Energy Agency, or IEA, which represents oil consuming countries, had a different take on the whole thing for 2024.While the EIA acknowledged that the current bull fervor in the market could indeed take prices higher in the near term, it nevertheless forecast weaker demand for oil from next year onwards.In 2024, demand growth for oil is forecast to slow sharply to 1 million barrels per day, the IEA said. It cited lackluster macroeconomic conditions, a post-pandemic recovery running out of steam and the burgeoning use of electric vehicles as among reasons.The IEA revised down its demand growth forecast for next year by 150,000 barrels per day from the estimate it made in August.""With the post-pandemic rebound largely completed and as multiple headwinds challenge the OECD's outlook, oil consumption gains slow markedly,"" the IEA said, referring to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations.Story continues""The global economic outlook remains challenging in the face of soaring interest rates and tighter bank credit, squeezing businesses that are already having to cope with sluggish manufacturing and trade,"" the IEA added.Traders, however, went with OPEC’s more dramatized outlook on the supply squeeze.""Crude prices are rallying after the OPEC monthly report showed the oil market is going to be a lot tighter than initially thought,"" said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.London-traded Brent settled Tuesday’s trade at $92.06, up $1.42, or 1.6%. It earlier hit $92.39, its highest since November 2022.New York-traded WTI closed the official trading for the day at $88.84, after rising $1.55, or 1.8%. It hit a 10-month high of $89.36 earlier in the session.Aside from the OPEC outlook issued Tuesday, crude prices were also pressured upwards from the disruption of four oil export terminals in OPEC member Libya due to a deadly storm. Kazakhstan, an OPEC+ ally, also said it was reducing its daily oil output for maintenance.Market participants were also on the lookout for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Sept 8. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.0 million barrels, to add to the 6.307M-barrel reduction reported during the week to Sept. 1.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a draw of 1.0M barrels on top of the 2.666M-barrel decline in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a drop of 1.0M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.679M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil hits 2023 highs as OPEC harps on tight supplyUS committee recommends royalties on minerals for EVs in sweeping reform proposalUS SEC chief: climate rule won't require private farmers' emissions data]"

The GF Value Line gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to the GuruFocus Value calculation, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) appears to be fairly valued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Devon Energy (DVN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.45 per share, indicating a change of -33.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -32.5%. This estimate has changed +2.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.58 indicates a change of +17.3% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.97 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -26.8%. The $15.3 billion and $16.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -20.2% and +5.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.6%. EPS of $1.18 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -9.23%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for United Rentals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Rentals is:31% = US$2.3b ÷ US$7.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.31.Does United Rentals Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, United Rentals has a higher ROE than the average (18%) in the Trade Distributors industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for United Rentals visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining United Rentals' Debt And Its 31% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by United Rentals, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.59. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course United Rentals may not be the best stock to buy.

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.Story continuesSafra Ada CatzThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, 22 years ago today was a traumatic day for our country. Like many of you, it feels like yesterday when the country lost nearly 3,000 souls. And we at Oracle, we lost 11 employees. I remember exactly where I was when the tragedy unfolded and it is still so hard speaking about it even all these years later. Today, we honor and remember each one of the victims and heroes, and we hope that their memories are a blessing to all of us.Now before I go to our Q1 numbers, I thought it would help to start with some of the things that are going on at Oracle that you'll be hearing about over the next couple of weeks. Next week, we have Oracle CloudWorld, which will showcase the latest innovations, including AI on OCI, the progress of Oracle Autonomous Database our multi-cloud strategy, the use of Oracle analytics throughout our portfolio to drive better decision-making and the use of generative AI to differentiate Fusion, NetSuite and our industry application.Now CloudWorld is our marquee event each year where current and prospective customers take time out of their busy calendars to join us in person and share their experiences. We know that there are no better spokespeople for our products and services than our existing customers. Our innovation result directly from our development teams interacting with customers to anticipate and build the next generation of products and services. Some of the customers you will hear from next week include NVIDIA, Uber, Ascension Health, Cohere, and many, many, many more. You'll also hear from our expanding set of strategic partners that are driving the Oracle ecosystem, and this includes Amdocs, VMware, Microsoft.Overall, it's remarkable the interest we are getting from the ISV community to work with Oracle. There are a lot of discussions going on and you will see more announcements shortly. From a financial standpoint, we see this customer and partner ecosystem as a leading indicator of our income statement. I've been talking with you about our revenue acceleration for some time now. In Q1, our remaining performance obligations or RPO climbed to nearly $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11%. We have now signed several deals for OCI greater than $1 billion in total value. And the first week of Q2, we booked an additional $1.5 billion in business, which isn't even included in the Q1 numbers. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. My point here is that customer momentum is continuing to build. This momentum is turning into bookings, and that gives me the confidence that our annual revenue growth will continue to accelerate moving forward.Now to the Q1 results, which I remind you I am announcing on day 11, only because day 8, when we were ready, was a Friday and I know none of you like that. So this quarter, we saw a modest currency tailwind, but as always, I'll discuss our financials using constant currency growth rates. Clearly, Q1 was another great quarter with total revenue at the midpoint of guidance and earnings per share $0.02 above the high end of guidance and our cloud growth was 29%. Total cloud revenue, SaaS and IaaS, excluding Cerner was $4 billion, up 29%. Now including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 29% also, at $4.6 billion and with our IaaS revenue at $1.5 billion, up 64%, and SaaS revenue of $3.1 billion, up 17%.Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.5 billion, up 12%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues which includes product support were $4.5 billion, up 11%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $6.9 billion and they grew 20%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.1 billion, up 14%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 64%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 Infrastructure Cloud services revenue grew 72% with an annualized revenue of $5.6 billion.OCI consumption revenue was up 91%. Exadata cloud services revenue was up 46%, and Autonomous Database was up 42%. Database subscription services, which includes license support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 44%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services.Software license revenues were $0.8 billion, down 11% following an amazing Q1 last year of 19% growth, which made it a tough compare this year. So in all, total revenue for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 8%, including Cerner, up 9% excluding Cerner.Shifting to margins. The gross margins for Cloud Services and License Support was 78% with IaaS gross margins improving substantially from last year. And while we've continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our IaaS margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses very carefully to ensure our gross margin percentages expand as we scale up. To this point, gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 9% in Q1. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 41%, up from 39% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also grow the operating margin percentage.The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8% and non-GAAP EPS was USD 1.19, up 16% in USD, up 14% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was USD 0.86. At quarter end, we had nearly $12.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $11.1 billion, up 5%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was up 9% to $7 billion, while free cash flow was up 21% to $5.7 billion, and I expect that we will see very good results in our free cash flow for the rest of the year. Over the last 4 quarters, operating cash flow was $17.7 billion, up 68%, and free cash flow was $9.5 billion, up 76%.Capital expenditures were $8.3 billion over the last 4 quarters, and we're clearly beginning to see the cash flow benefits stemming from our cloud transformation. CapEx was $1.3 billion in Q1 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the demand we have and see in the pipeline, I expect that fiscal year 2024 CapEx will be similar to this past year's CapEx. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud business. We now have 64 cloud regions live with 44 public cloud regions around the world and another 6 being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure. We also have 9 dedicated regions live and 11 more planned, 9 security regions and 12 EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And of course, we have many, many Cloud at Customer implementations.The cost advantages, sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud region continue to make us so compelling in the marketplace to customers. As we've said many, many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.9 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share.Now before I dive into Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see longer term. Per my earlier remarks, we have a great line of sight into the trajectory of the business, given the bookings momentum. We are extremely confident about our revenue acceleration for the year even though in any quarter, there may be small fluctuations. Because we have far more demand than we can supply, our biggest challenge is building data centers as quickly as possible. In addition, we are in an accelerated transition of Cerner to the cloud. This transition is resulting in some near-term headwinds to the Cerner growth rate as customers move from license purchases, which are recognized upfront, to cloud subscriptions which are recognized ratably. Again, excluding Cerner, I remain committed to accelerating our total revenue growth rate this fiscal year as well as maintaining our current high cloud growth rates for the year. And as you will hear at our Financial Analyst Meeting next week, we remain firmly committed to our fiscal '26 financial goals.Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 2% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.03 positive effect on EPS in Q2. However, the actual currency impact may be different. Here we go. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in constant currency and are expected to grow 5% to 7% in USD at today's rates. Total revenue, excluding Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and expected to grow 8% to 10% in USD.Total cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, again, I give you these numbers so you can see the mainline business, is expected to grow from 27% to 29% in constant currency and is expected to grow 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 5% to 9% and be between $1.27 and $1.31 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 7% to 11% and be between USD 1.30 and USD 1.34. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.Lawrence J. EllisonThank you, Safra. So, is generative AI the most important new computer technology ever? Maybe. We're about to find out. Self-driving cars, computer-designed antiviral drugs, voice user interfaces. Generative AI is changing the automobile industry, the pharmaceutical industry, how people communicate with their computers. Generative AI is changing everything. As of today, AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation2 Cloud. That's twice as much AI training as we have booked at the end of the last Q4.I'm also very pleased to announce that XAI has signed a contract to do training in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud. The largest AI technology companies and the leading AI start-ups continue to expand their business with Oracle for one simple reason: Oracle's RDMA-interconnected NVIDIA superclusters train AI models at twice the speed and much less than half the cost of other clouds.But growth in our AI cloud infrastructure business is not the only exciting news we have to report in Oracle. Our cloud applications business is doing quite well and it's about to get even better. In the current quarter, we expect our Cerner Health business to be awarded 2 large new contracts with a total value of over $1 billion. And I'm now also able to announce that all 9 utility companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway are in the process of replacing all their existing ERP systems and standardizing on Oracle's Fusion Cloud applications.Let me conclude with a few words about our database business and our upcoming announcement with Microsoft later this week. We will be substantially expanding our existing multi-cloud partnership with Microsoft by making it easier for Microsoft Azure customers to buy and use the latest Oracle cloud database technology in combination with Microsoft Azure cloud services. Safra and I will discuss the details of our expanding partnership at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond on the 14th. Please tune in. And thank you. Back to you, Safra.Safra Ada CatzThanks, Larry, and maybe Ken, we could start taking questions at this point.Ken BondAbsolutely. Before we do that, Lisa, just one quick clarification that we currently have 2 EU sovereign regions live with more to come. Lisa, please poll the audience for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.Brad Alan ZelnickCongrats on the strong start to the year. Larry, I think it's fair to say you understand the laws of data gravity better than anyone, and you've monetized this fundamental concept as well as anyone over the years. And I recently heard someone say we're moving from a world of data gravity to one of AI gravity, and I'm not sure exactly what that means or if they even knew what that meant.But with AI and other use cases attracting more and more data to central clouds with many vendors preaching data sharing instead of what used to be making multiple copies of things and keeping them synchronized, does AI plus cloud in any way break what we've always understood about data gravity? And what does that mean for Oracle?Lawrence J. EllisonWell, you can't build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So if anything, what AI, generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting -- that there's a vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train OpenAI, to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public Internet. They read all of Wikipedia. They read everything. They ingested everything.And to specialize, and you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let's say. And we have Partners Imaging, for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models. We have another partner of ours in AI ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn't work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data.So in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravity to AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillion developments went into building ChatGPT 3.5. Multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you had to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. So we think this is very good for our database business. And Oracle's new vector database will contain the highly specialized training data like electronic health records while keeping that data anonymized and private yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases.So we think it's a boon to our business, and we are now getting into the deepwater of the information age. Nothing has changed about that. The demands on data are getting stronger and more important.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.Mark Ronald MurphySo Larry, companies are starting to understand that OCI has a very fundamentally different architecture than anything else out there in the market because of the nonblocking low-latency network design. I'm wondering if you think it's possible to actually pull farther ahead through some of your other initiatives. For instance, the Azure interconnect, it sounds like you're going to expand that having more regions, running a stronger database, providing greater isolation. Just wondering if you think there's a possibility of extending the lead.Lawrence J. EllisonWell again, we have -- we're on our second generation of data center and our second generation of cloud. Now a lot of people noticed that we were a little bit late to the party. That's because we moved from a first generation, which we were not very happy with, to a second generation which we think solves a lot of problems the other cloud companies have not yet solved. So the nonblocking ultrafast RDMA network is not only useful for training AI models, it's useful for almost everything. It's certainly useful for building a much faster database. It's useful for -- in terms of the automation level we have in our data centers.Our data centers are 100% automated. They configure themselves. They run themselves. We don't have a lot of labor. Now that saves us a huge amount of money, a lot of labor cost is saved. But the biggest advantage is if you don't have human beings involved, you don't have human labor, you don't have human errors. You don't have mistakes. You can ensure security. Most security problems are caused by people that make mistakes or people that engage in mischief. We don't have that in our data center. That's another huge advantage.Our data centers are -- because they're identical, the only way we could automate them was to make them all the same and they vary only by scale. There are big ones and small ones but they're identical. They all have the same hardware pieces and the same software pieces. They all have the same automation. And that automation allows us to put these data centers in very small countries. We expect to have many, many more data centers than any other cloud provider.But we also put those data centers at customers. Nomura Research, NRI, which resells Oracle cloud capacity in Japan, has 2 dedicated regions and are building 2 more. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I don't know of any clouds that are running stock exchanges other than ours. And again, it's because of the extreme reliability and security that we get with all of the automation that's included with our data center. So we have cost advantages. We have performance advantages. We have security advantages. And that's why we're growing much faster than any of the other hyperscalers.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.Raimo LenschowLarry, you mentioned Berkshire and then moving over to Fusion. I just wanted to talk more in a more bigger picture on the back office systems. Like in the olden days, back office, you wouldn't touch in kind of tougher times because you had big complex projects. But you guys are still kind of growing this nicely with over 20%. Like what are you seeing there? And do you see a change, a pipeline change in customer interest of doing something there?Lawrence J. EllisonYes. Well, the back office in the cloud is very different than the back office on-premise. And we have a big advantage that we are, by far and away, the biggest, I don't know, 95% of the cloud ERP market in terms of actual live customers using it. And we have an important partnership with JPMorgan Chase, and we'll be announcing some more partnerships in the financial community at the upcoming CloudWorld, where we automate a lot of e-commerce, B2B e-commerce right in the cloud.So what is B2B e-commerce between 2 Oracle Cloud customers, 2 Oracle ERP Cloud customers? It's 1 Oracle procurement system talking to another Oracle order management system and financing the transaction through their bank. We automate that entirely in the cloud. If your bank is JPMorgan Chase, they originate the loan right along with your purchase. It's e-commerce for B2B with banking and shipping and insurance, all included enrolled together.No one -- we've done a great job as an industry automating e-commerce for B2C. I mean, Amazon, Walmart, others have done a brilliant job in that. We've been doing that for a long time. We have not got the equivalent in B2B commerce because B2B transactions are much more complex. In the cloud, you can get all the parties together, the shippers, the insurance company, the manufacturers, the purchasers, and we can automate that entirely within the Oracle Cloud, one ERP system talking to another, talking to their bank, talking to their insurance, doing the loan origination, getting it shipped and insured. So we make doing business much easier for our customers when they move to a modern cloud ERP system versus the on-premise ERP system that came before.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.Mark L. MoerdlerThe top of mind questions I'm getting are related to AI in general as you'd expect. And more specifically as it relates to Oracle, what impact of AI will be on OCI Gen2. Two related parts to the question. The first is the profitability of AI supercomputers and whether, as some clients try to tell me, its low-calorie, empty calorie revenue, or can you maintain margins as this business grows?And the second part is about the Oracle ecosystem, and is it strong enough that as workloads transition from model training to inferencing and grounding, could AI compute create a revenue air pocket or are these kind of systems strong enough so you don't have that?Lawrence J. EllisonWell, if -- you're constantly training these models. Keep in mind, you have to bring in new data if you're obviously in the health care field, in the legal field, new cases are being judged, new research is being published all the time. And for your AI models to be relevant, they have to be up to date. So it's not that you train and then do nothing but inferencing thereafter. So your training and your inferencing sit right next to each other.As long as we can do this stuff twice as fast as everybody else, that's on the -- by the way, not just on the training side, that's also on the inferencing side, then we're going to be half the cost or better. So we think we're going to be very, very competitive across the board, whether it's training or in inferencing. So we don't -- so we're pretty confident that we've got a cost performance advantage. Again, if you run twice as fast in the cloud, you cost half as much because you pay by the hour.So the performance advantage is really an enormous cost advantage for us. We don't see that going away anytime soon. And it applies to inferencing as well as training. Now as far as GPUs -- our GPU is a low-margin business. Not for 100% automated cloud with very, very low cost. We think in some cases, our prices for GPU training, which are very profitable by the way, for us, but are often lower -- our prices are lower than the cost of other hyperscalers doing the training.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.Keith WeissI wanted to drill in on Cerner, basically the 1-year anniversary of that acquisition. And maybe from Larry, get an update on where we are with modernizing that solution and modernizing that product. And basically, whether Cerner has kind of lived up to your expectations thus far? And then maybe for Safra, if we could dig into the expense synergy side of the equation. You guys have done a great job increasing margins on a year-on-year basis in this quarter. How much is left to go within Cerner and getting that margin profile to match the broader Oracle margin profile?Lawrence J. EllisonOkay, I'll talk about the progress on taking the existing Millennium Cerner software and moving it to new Millennium, basically rewriting that software a piece at a time, by the way. It's not going to be a big rip and replace that all. There's a 2-phase process with Cerner. The first thing is to get -- to lift and shift and get the existing system hardened, which we've done and moving the customers to the cloud, which we're in the process of moving everybody to the cloud. That will give them better performance, better security and new features will then start showing up with the system.And so there's a 2-phase shift to the cloud, We're well on our way. The next is replace feature after feature after feature of the older Cerner system with a new Cerner system, new Millennium, which we are not coding in Java like we usually do. The new Cerner system is being generated, as you know, generative AI generates code. We have an application generator called APEX. And we are not writing code for the new Cerner. We are generating that code in APEX and it's going extremely well.Again, one of the great things about code generators is they don't make mistakes. Well, either they make the same mistake over and over again or they don't -- once you fixed the mistake, you fixed it everywhere. So the code -- we're using a code generator to write the new features in Cerner, and it's coming along very, very nicely. Also on the business side of things, again, we think that Cerner business is going to get stronger and stronger.Again, Safra made the point. The old Cerner business, you'd sell license so you sell a big contract and you get a big chunk of revenue in that quarter. Our new business model, as you know, is cloud. So we get a big Cerner award and we get that money now over time rather than all upfront. So that's, if you will, a bit of a revenue headwind, but the Cerner business is doing extraordinarily well.Safra Ada CatzAnd on the expense side, we still have a ways to go, but I think it will become more obvious to you next quarter, the changes we've made as they play out through the income statement more clearly. And so you'll have a better comparison Q2 to Q2, which will be a full non-deal quarter for you to look at. But you know us, we're always looking to save as much as we can and to spend as little while still really transforming Cerner into a modern system in its entirety.Lawrence J. EllisonLet me just reinforce what Safra just said. We love to save money. One of the things we did with our data centers is we automated them. We saved labor costs and we saved -- we have better security and better reliability because we eliminated human error. With Cerner, the rewrite of Cerner, it's not armies of programmers that are going to be rewriting this. We are generating the new Millennium software using APEX. And that's also going to save us a lot of human labor and generate higher-quality code and higher-quality user interfaces and better security all at once.OperatorWe'll take our last question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.John Stephen DiFucciMy question is for Safra, I think. Safra, if the organic constant currency cloud growth was in line with what you did last year and what you want to do for this year at 29%, while license, though it was a difficult comp, it was a bit weaker, at least, than the Street was expecting. And I also -- we also realized that cloud revenue for the same amount of business booked will be a lot less than the equivalent license revenue in the quarter.But does this mean we're seeing a move with stronger momentum to the cloud this quarter than we have seen? And I guess just to clarify, given your guidance for the second quarter. You said you're maintaining your longer-term stuff. But I just want to clarify, are you maintaining your constant currency organic cloud guidance for the year?Safra Ada CatzYes. Okay, let me start with yes. And as I want to remind you, of course, as I want to remind you, 29% of bigger numbers is more, okay? So last year, we were smaller, and this year, we continue to plan on doing the 29%, maybe better. All of it is dependent on us getting our data centers filled up and built out as fast as possible. The level of demand we have is stunning. Stunning is the only word I can use.And I don't want to get overly exuberant simply because we do have to continue to build out our systems, et cetera. And so yes, a very strong momentum to the cloud. And again, with the focus -- we told you, we're bringing our customers to the cloud, and that's going to have us focusing on growing that and stronger momentum there.John Stephen DiFucciOkay, great. Very clear. Yes and yes. Got it.Ken BondAll right. Thank you, John, and thank you, Lisa. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today, and with that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.OperatorThat does conclude today's presentation.

STX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of STXSeagate Technology Holdings PLC (STX): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 7/103. Growth rank: 3/104. GF Value rank: 3/105. Momentum rank: 8/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Seagate Technology Holdings PLC the GF Score of 68 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC: A SnapshotSeagate Technology Holdings PLC, with a market cap of $13.3 billion, is a leading supplier of hard disk drives for data storage to the enterprise and consumer markets. It forms a practical duopoly in the market with its chief rival, Western Digital; they are both vertically integrated. The company reported sales of $7.38 billion and an operating margin of 0.81. However, the company's recent performance and financial metrics suggest potential challenges ahead.Story continuesSeagate Technology Holdings PLC (STX): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisSeagate Technology Holdings PLC's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.19 positions it worse than 99.12% of 1591 companies in the Hardware industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.27, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.14 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 17.68, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 95.66% of 1658 companies in the Hardware industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Seagate Technology Holdings PLC seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -3.5 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 71.98% of 2313 companies in the Hardware industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market.Over the past five years, Seagate Technology Holdings PLC has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -36, while the five-year growth rate is at -17.1. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability. Lastly, Seagate Technology Holdings PLC predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (STX): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights Seagate Technology Holdings PLC's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a strong market presence, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future.

On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.The Newell Brands (NWL) Dilemma: Understanding the Risks of a Possible Value TrapThe Risk Factors of Newell BrandsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newell Brands should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.67. These indicators suggest that Newell Brands, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesAbout Newell Brands IncIn this session, supply a succinct but thorough snapshot of the company's business operations and history, based on the 'Company Data'.

However, it has recently witnessed a decline of 3.87%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 14.76%. Fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of Newell Brands Inc.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NWL. Click here to check it out. NWL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NWLUnraveling the Challenges Ahead for Newell Brands Inc (NWL)Deciphering the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 4/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 2/104. GF Value rank: 8/105. Momentum rank: 2/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Newell Brands Inc the GF Score of 63 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Newell Brands Inc's BusinessNewell Brands Inc is an American global consumer goods company with a market cap of $3.96 billion and sales of $8.55 billion. The company operates through five segments: Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances, Home Solutions, Learning and Development, and Outdoor and Recreation. The Learning and Development segment, which offers baby gear and infant care products, writing instruments, art products, and labeling solutions, generates most of the revenue for the firm. The company's operating margin stands at 4.83%.Story continuesUnraveling the Challenges Ahead for Newell Brands Inc (NWL)Financial Strength BreakdownNewell Brands Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 1.56 positions it worse than 86.09% of 1352 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.67, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.05 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 52.72, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 97.99% of 1344 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Newell Brands Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -0.4 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 72.87% of 1714 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Newell Brands Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Challenges Ahead for Newell Brands Inc (NWL)ConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Newell Brands Inc has a rich history and a diverse product portfolio, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its future performance. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

China's passenger vehicle sales rebounded on a year-over-year basis in August, driven by increased discounts and tax incentives for eco-friendly vehicles. Despite a sluggish economic backdrop, consumer sentiment surged, resulting in 2.2% year-over-year growth in car sales, reaching 1.94 million units. This marks the first year-over-year increase since May, with a notable 8.5% rise from July. In the eight months of the year, total sales reached 13.38 million units, reflecting a 1.8% increase.As we know, Detroit 3 automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — face a strike threat if they don't reach an agreement with the United Auto Workers (“UAW”) before the current four-year contract expires at midnight on Sep 14, 2023. The UAW is determined to negotiate better terms, conditions and benefits for its members this year. To this end, Ford presented a contract offer to the UAW last to last week after the union called Detroit Three automakers to come up with counterproposals. However, Ford’s proposal fell short of UAW’s expectations. Last week, General Motors came up with a counterproposal, offering a wage hike of 10% to roughly 46,000 of its UAW-represented workers. However, Shawn Fain, the president of the UAW, called the offer “insulting.”On the news front, Asbury Automotive ABG is set to acquire Jim Koons Automotive Companies, marking the largest auto retail acquisition since 2021. Cummins CMI, PACCAR PCAR and Daimler announced a collaboration for battery cell production in the United States.

This significant deal includes 20 dealerships, 29 franchises, six collision centers and one of the highest-volume Toyota and Stellantis dealerships in the United States, with more than $3 billion in revenues in 2022. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024 and will be funded through Asbury's cash reserves, credit facility and existing liquidity. The auto retailer sees this acquisition as transformative, allowing it to expand into a rapidly growing Mid-Atlantic region.This buyout is a testament to the strength of the U.S. auto retail market in 2023. Asbury's president and CEO, David Hult, expressed confidence in the profitability of Koons dealerships and emphasized the shared values of both companies in prioritizing people, employees and the community. This acquisition represents a significant step forward for Asbury, solidifying its position as a major player in the U.S. automotive retail landscape.Magna unveiled its Gen5 front camera module system during the IAA Mobility 2023 event. Designed for a European original equipment manufacturer, this one-box camera module boasts an impressive 120-degree horizontal and 48-degree vertical field of view. The production of the same is set to commence in late September 2023. It can perceive obstacles up to 160 meters ahead and detect side objects like traffic lights, emergency vehicles and merging cars. With eight megapixels, a 36-frames-per-second frame rate and color imaging, the system can also fuse data from up to five radars. Notable features include Trained Park Assist, Environmental Condition Recognition, Monocular Scene Reconstruction and Hazard Detection, emphasizing road safety and driver assistance.Magna also updated its 2025 outlook to take into account the benefits of the Veoneer Active Safety buyout. It now expects full-year sales in the band of $46.7-$49.2 billion, up from the prior guidance of $44.7-$47.2 billion, due to the upward revision of the sales forecast of the Power &amp; Vision segment. Revenues from the segment are projected in the $16.8-$17.4 billion range, up from the previous forecast of $14.8-$15.4 billion. Sales expectations from the Body Exteriors &amp; Structures, Seating Systems and Complete Vehicles units remain unchanged in the band of $20-$21 billion, $6.2-$6.6 billion and $4-$4.5 billion, respectively.  The adjusted EBIT margin is envisioned at 6.7-7.8%, same as the prior guidance.Allison was awarded a contract for the second phase of the U.S. Army’s Low-Rate Initial Production. The contract is worth nearly $13 million and is for producing the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle, formerly known as Mobile Protected Firepower. The M10 Booker, a modernization initiative by the U.S. Army, seeks to strengthen the combat power of the Army’s Infantry Brigade Combat Teams. The vehicle has reached the second phase of low-rate production with Allison’s 3040 MX cross-drive transmission.Allison has a knack for providing its customers with propulsion solutions required for armored combat vehicles. The U.S. Army is likely to buy 500 MPF vehicles by 2035, contributing approximately $250 million in revenues for Allison’s Defense end market. The 3040 MX transmission is one of the many cross-drive propulsion solutions from Allison. The variants of the X200 Series, X1100 Series, 2000 SP Series, 3000 SP Series, 4000 SP Series and the new eGen Force are additional defense product offerings by Allison that are applied throughout the organization.Cummins, PACCAR and Daimler have formed a joint venture (JV) to accelerate and localize battery cell production and the battery supply chain in the United States. Through this JV, the companies plan to manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications. For the 21-gigawatt-hour factory, total investment is estimated to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Each of the three companies will own 30% of the JV. The initial focus of the JV will be the lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery technology family for commercial battery-electric trucks.Cummins, PACCAR and Daimler expect the demand for battery technology to boom this decade, and a state-of-the-art dedicated battery cell factory is expected to benefit U.S. customers. EVE Energy, a Chinese battery cell manufacturer, will hold a 10% stake in the JV and serve as a technology partner. The joint venture not only advances critical technology solutions but also accelerates the U.S. energy transition. It seeks to localize top-quality battery production to support customer operational and environmental objectives.

The authorization is for planning and preliminary design work for a new multimodal facility at the AirTrain Newark Rail Link station serving EWR.

It is calculated based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow), a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value at which the stock should be traded.ResMed (NYSE:RMD) is believed to be significantly undervalued, according to our valuation method. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $153.15 per share, ResMed stock is believed to be significantly undervalued.Story continuesBecause ResMed is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.ResMed (RMD): An Uncovered Gem?

320,f4be0b87-9741-38d3-a861-864b4c9582fa,PNR,2023-09-12,Pentair plc's (NYSE:PNR) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pentair-plcs-nyse-pnr-stocks-103949682.html,1694515189,STORY,['PNR'],"[Pentair's (NYSE:PNR) stock is up by a considerable 13% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Pentair's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Pentair How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pentair is:17% = US$494m ÷ US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.17 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Pentair's Earnings Growth And 17% ROETo begin with, Pentair seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 14%. This certainly adds some context to Pentair's decent 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Pentair's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 7.9% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is PNR worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PNR is currently mispriced by the market.Is Pentair Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Pentair has a three-year median payout ratio of 28%, which implies that it retains the remaining 72% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, Pentair has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 21%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Pentair's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

The agreement furthers Direct Air Capture (DAC) as a viable carbon removal solution to help organizations further their climate goals.The CDR credits for Amazon will be enabled by STRATOS, 1PointFive’s first commercial-scale DAC plant, currently under construction in Texas. The plant is designed to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually when fully operational, making it the largest plant in the world, and a milestone in reaching climate relevant scale.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world needs to remove roughly 1 trillion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere over the course of this century to keep global warming below the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit set by the Paris Climate Agreement.1PointFive is progressing the development of Carbon Engineering’s Direct Air Capture technology, alongside other decarbonization solutions, at an industrial scale to help organizations achieve their net zero goals. Under the agreement with Amazon, the captured CO2 underlying the CDR credits will be stored in saline reservoirs that are not associated with oil and gas production.“Amazon’s purchase and long-term contract represent a significant commitment to direct air capture as a vital carbon removal solution,” said Michael Avery, President and General Manager of 1PointFive. “The addition of 1PointFive’s high-integrity, quantifiable carbon removal credits support Amazon’s path to achieve net zero and shows the growing role that DAC technology will play in decarbonization pathways. We are excited to collaborate with Amazon to help them achieve their sustainability goals.”Story continues“Amazon’s primary focus is to decarbonize our global operations and reach net-zero carbon by 2040 through our transition to renewable energy, building with more sustainable materials and electrifying our delivery fleet and global logistics. We are also pursuing changes such as reducing the weight of packaging per shipment for our customers. At the same time, we also need to seek every possible avenue to reduce carbon in the atmosphere,” said Kara Hurst, vice president of worldwide sustainability at Amazon. “These investments in direct air capture complement our emissions reductions plans and we are excited to support the growth and deployment of this technology.”About 1PointFive 1PointFive is a Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS) company that is working to help curb global temperature rise to 1.5°C by 2050 through the deployment of decarbonization solutions, including Carbon Engineering’s Direct Air Capture and AIR TO FUELS™ solutions alongside geologic sequestration hubs.

""Whenever people feel visible, they invest in their appearance.""Prior to COVID-19, the global beauty industry was a $532 billion business, with the US being its largest market, according to the Brazilian industry organization ABIHPEC. Driven by skin care, the US prestige beauty industry amassed a total of $18.8 billion in sales throughout 2019.Today, revenue for the beauty and personal care market amounts to $579 billion and is expected to grow by 3.53% annually, according to Statista estimates.""There's a lot more experimentation,"" Brown added. ""It used to be that you'd have a few products sold for newness. And I think especially with Gen Z, there's a lot more search for newness, and trial and experimentation. The trends cycled through much quicker than they used to.""A shop attendant applies lipstick on her hand for a customer to check the shade at a store in Peshawar, Pakistan, May 22, 2019. (Fayaz Aziz/REUTERS) (Fayaz Aziz / reuters)'The big gorilla': L’OréalThe leaders of the US beauty space include Unilever (UL), Estée Lauder (EL), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Shiseido (SSDOY), LVMH (LVMUY), Beiersdorf (BDRFY), Chanel, Natura &amp; Co, and Coty (COTY).And then there is L’Oréal (LRLCY), which is the largest cosmetics and beauty company in the world.Like many companies, the French conglomerate took a revenue hit in 2020 as COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions weighed on sales. Yet it remained the leader and gained market share as Unilever and Estée Lauder battled for the No. 2 spot. In 2021, L’Oréal's sales rebounded to 32.29 billion euros.""In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic ... triggered a crisis of supply due to the widespread closure of points of sale which led to an unprecedented, if temporary, decline of the beauty market,"" L’Oréal chairman Jean Paul Agon said following the company's Q4 2020 results. ""L’Oréal has traversed this crisis in the best possible condition and has even grown stronger.""Story continuesOne reason for L’Oréal's dominance has been its edge in the hair care category: It's ""the big gorilla in hair"" compared to rivals, Brown told Yahoo Finance.Estée Lauder, meanwhile, has lost market share in the US to L’Oréal. In the company’s recent earnings call, Estée Lauder president Fabrizio Freda said, “We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior-year period.”Despite losses, Estée Lauder is looking to reaccelerate growth across the globe. The cosmetics giant is looking to innovate across its skin care category, enter new markets, and sell inventory to licensees.However, smaller brands are now starting to enter the fray.""The brands that are innovating and marketing effectively behind that innovation will succeed at it,"" Raymond James senior analyst Olivia Tong told Yahoo Finance. ""And that's the [more] important point rather than the size of the company.""Beauty trends driving the industryA few emerging trends in the beauty industry accelerated during the pandemic.When the demand for cosmetics changed suddenly, brands were forced to adapt and many started offering new products.Entrepreneurs Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloe Kardashian took advantage of the shift in consumer demand and used their influence to manufacture and distribute hand sanitizers through Kylie Cosmetics and face masks through SKIMS and Good American brands.

(David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) (David Dee Delgado via Getty Images)Then, throughout the pandemic, millions of consumers took to online shopping.Consequently, e-commerce has become a major factor for the beauty industry, nearly quadrupling between 2015 and 2022, a McKinsey report found, with its share accounting for more than 20%.According to projections, e-commerce will grow at 12% per year between 2022 and 2027, making it the fastest-growing sales channel for the beauty industry.Another element that gained traction is social media, which played a major role in the pivot to e-commerce.""I think social media has been a big game changer for beauty in general,"" Canaccord Genuity managing director Susan Anderson told Yahoo Finance Live in May. ""I think it's really gotten the consumer engaged in the category.""Although beauty sales are dominated by a handful of players, including prestige and private label collections from retailers such as Sephora and Ulta (ULTA), smaller brands such as ColourPop and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) have been able to remain competitive and amass their own loyal followings, in part due to product innovation and social media.E.l.f. cosmetic products are seen for sale in a store in New York City, June 29, 2022. (Andrew Kelly/REUTERS) (Andrew Kelly / reuters)""What I would say about brands like e.l.f., [and] to a lesser extent ColourPop, is what they’ve really, really done well, is they've taken the innovation and the kind of fashion-forward appeal of Sephora brands and they made it very, very affordable,"" Brown said. ""So they move quickly. They're basically fast fashion for beauty.""Others point out that e.l.f. has created value for consumers beyond its price point by offering quality and convenience.""They are not relying just on being the most inexpensive,"" Tong explained. ""They are spending money behind it. … They care about product quality, advertising, partnering with the retailer, all the things that a lot of companies do, and building an audience for that.""That innovation has been an engine for the industry by leading to incremental sales.""When it comes to cosmetics, it's a lot harder to saturate,"" she said. ""Because I may have 10 lipsticks, but if I love the new formulation or I love the new packaging, I can always find space for 11.""Niko Lopez and Mahi Chaurasia attend Sephora At Kohl's VIP Event at Valley Ranch Kohls on Aug. 8, 2022 in Irving, Texas. (Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images for Sephora at Kohl's) (Richard Rodriguez via Getty Images)'Lipstick effect' props up beautyWhile the US has so far been able to stave off a recession coming out of the pandemic, industry execs have been eyeing consumer spending closely for any signs of weakening.""I think the word of the last 18 months has been resilient to describe the consumer,"" Avondale Asset Management founder Scott Krisiloff told Yahoo Finance in July. ""But still the consumer is very resilient, continues to spend, continues to want to have the experiences that the consumer wants to have.""That has especially been the case in the beauty industry, which historically holds up better than other industries during economic downturns due to what experts call ""the lipstick effect.""According to Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research, the lipstick effect occurs when consumers continue to spend on small luxuries, even as they pull back on spending in other areas.Lipstick represents ""an affordable luxury for consumers that may not be experiencing gains in other places,"" Kodali said. ""It's a way to indulge yourself in an affordable way, and it's something that we see happen in almost any type of economic hardship.""The relative strength of consumers has given companies the confidence to make major M&amp;A deals even in an uncertain economic environment, a positive sign for the industry overall. ""The growth in beauty has been built on effective or strategic acquisitions,"" Brown said.In recent decades, M&amp;A has become a core part of L’Oréal’s growth strategy.In April, L’Oréal acquired Australian skin care brand Aesop in a deal that valued Aesop at $2.5 billion. It marked L’Oréal's largest acquisition to date aimed at helping the beauty giant expand its presence in the luxury market and in China, the second-largest beauty market behind the US.In addition to M&amp;A, more beauty brands have looked to expand through brand partnerships with major retailers.In the second quarter, Target (TGT) executives highlighted double-digit growth in the beauty category, driven by in-store Ulta locations, known as shop-in-shops. Department stores such as Macy’s (M) continued to see outperformance from prestige beauty brands such as Estée Lauder. And Sephora locations in Kohl's (KSS) stores offered a bright spot for the retailer.""Sephora at Kohl's continues to exceed our expectations, driving a total beauty sales increase of nearly 90% year over year,"" Kohl's CEO Thomas Kingsbury said in the company's second quarter earnings call. ""We opened nearly 200 Sephora shops in the quarter, and momentum in our existing Sephora shops continues to accelerate with greater than 20% comparable beauty sales growth in the Sephora shops opened in 2021 and 2022.""While some retailers warned that consumers may be growing more cautious, shoppers are still invested in spending across beauty, hair, and skin care.""There isn’t really a slowdown in sight,"" Brown said.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.67% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.14%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had lost 4.64% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 3.7% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.73% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Coca-Cola as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Coca-Cola is projected to report earnings of $0.69 per share, which would represent no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $11.48 billion, up 3.78% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.63 per share and revenue of $45.01 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.05% and +4.68%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Coca-Cola is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Coca-Cola has a Forward P/E ratio of 22.15 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 19.91.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that KO currently has a PEG ratio of 3.42. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Beverages - Soft drinks stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.44 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

329,292f8bef-d67e-31e7-aeb3-03eb16e96d68,KO,2023-09-12,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-trending-stock-130011052.html,1694437211,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.7% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has lost 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.82 indicates a change of +7% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $45.01 billion and $47.43 billion estimates indicate +4.7% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.03%. The EPS surprise was +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MHK is gaining from strategic restructuring initiatives, focus on operational excellence and accretive acquisitions.Recently, this leading global manufacturer of flooring products, reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter 2023, wherein its earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6% and 0.6%, respectively. This upside was attributable to sequential margin improvement across the enterprise on the back of seasonal improvements, increased production, productivity initiatives and lower input costs.Shares of MHK have outperformed the Zacks Textile - Home Furnishing industry so far this year. Earnings estimate for 2023 has moved north to $9.38 per share from $9.36 over the past 30 days. This depicts analysts' optimism about the company’s growth prospects.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is suffering from ongoing inflationary pressures and a risky macroeconomic environment.Let’s delve deeper.Factors Favoring the StockMohawk is consistently focusing on various strategic initiatives to maintain its ongoing growth momentum in the risky market. The initiatives highlight investments made to increase sales and reduce expenses by enhancing productivity, consolidating distribution points and improving administrative efficiencies. It has also been closing less efficient operations and investing in more productive equipment. The company now expects that these restructuring and integration actions will save $35 million annually.Mohawk also engages in broadening its product portfolio via acquisitions to cater to a wider range of customers globally. Since 2013, it has completed 32 acquisitions till-second quarter 2023. This year, the company completed acquisitions of two ceramic tile businesses in Brazil and Mexico within the Global Ceramic segment.Mohawk’s higher internal investments to boost its capacity and enter new markets also bode well. It selectively invests in greenfield projects and acquisitions (primarily in new product categories and geographies), cost-saving initiatives as well as share buyback to enhance long-term performance. The company is also adding unique capabilities to introduce differentiated products and anticipates higher productivity improvement in the days ahead.Story continuesFactors Hindering GrowthMHK has been experiencing rising inflationary pressures, primarily in material, energy and transportation. Rising product development costs and labor shortages add to the woes. In second-quarter 2023, its growth trend was hindered by lower sales volume and higher inflation along with temporary plant shutdowns, negative price, mix and unfavorable net impact of foreign exchange. SG&amp;A expenses expanded 360 bps year over year due to higher inflation than benefits received from acquisitions.Ongoing inflationary pressures drive a change in consumer discretionary spending while higher interest rates have moderated demand for homes, which is impacting housing sales. MHK expects continued pressure on pricing and mix along with seasonally soft demand patterns in third-quarter 2023. The company expects third-quarter adjusted earnings to be $2.62-$2.72 per share, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges. This indicates a significant decline from the year-ago figure of $3.34 per share.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV and Strategic Education, Inc. STRA.Royal Caribbean presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

WY, Trex Company, Inc. TREX and Boise Cascade Co. BCC.Industry: Building Products - WoodLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2147310/top-3-stocks-to-buy-on-prospering-wood-industry-trendsThe companies under the Zacks Building Products – Wood industry are expected to benefit from higher demand across repair and remodel (R&amp;R) activity and more funding for infrastructure and carbon/ESG-related projects. Although soft demand from the residential market and a difficult macroeconomic and geopolitical environment has been hurting, the companies’ inorganic and prudent cost containment should support industry players like Weyerhaeuser Co., Trex Company, Inc. and Boise Cascade Co.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products – Wood industry includes forest product companies and manufacturers of lumber as well as other wood products used in home construction, repair and remodeling along with the development of outdoor structures. Companies in the industry design, manufacture, source and sell flooring products like tile, wood, laminate, vinyl, and natural stone flooring products as well as decorative and installation accessories.The industry players are also involved in the manufacturing and distribution of wood and plastic composite products along with related accessories, mainly for residential decking and railing applications. The industry also includes timberland real estate investment trusts or REITs.4 Trends Shaping the Future of Building Products - Wood IndustrySpending on Carbon/ESG Projects, Repair &amp; Remodeling: The industry participants are experiencing higher funding for carbon/ESG-related projects to pursue carbon capture and storage work. The industry’s prospects are highly correlated with the U.S. housing market conditions. Although the slowing housing market and pandemic-related challenges are creating hurdles, the R&amp;R market (considered one of the largest in terms of lumber demand) has been impressive.Story continuesThe age of U.S. housing stock and a higher level of homeowner equity provide a favorable backdrop for repair-and-remodel spending for 2023. Also, increased government spending on infrastructure projects bodes well.Acquisitions, Product Innovation &amp; Efficient Cost-Reduction Strategies: The companies also bank on acquisitions and divestitures to expand and improve portfolio quality. New products continue to be an important top-line driver for the industry players. Also, efforts to introduce products are likely to have helped the players.Again, in a bid to reduce costs, companies have been reducing the cost structure of their facilities through Lean Six Sigma efforts, the sale or shutdown of underperforming units and manufacturing facilities, as well as investments in technology. Also, the industry players have been focusing on operational excellence, comprising merchandising for value, harvest, and transportation efficiencies and boosting harvest to capture seasonal and short-term opportunities.Lower Demand: The slowdown in the U.S. housing market has been impacting demand. Presently, the outlook for the housing industry remains less favorable compared to the last couple of years due to several headwinds, such as a rapid increase in mortgage rates, housing affordability challenges, high inflation and growing concerns about the economy. Although the residential market has started to gain momentum owing to the lack of existing homes for sale, macroeconomic uncertainties might dampen demand in the future.Rapid Lumber Market Swings &amp; Supply Chain-Related Challenges Weigh on Margins: Historically, volatility in lumber prices has been a major concern for the wood industry. Any unusual rise in the cost of lumber products sold by primary producers increases the cost of inventory and limits margins on fixed-priced lumber products. Yet, a decline in costs eats into profits as products sold are indexed to the current lumber market.Meanwhile, the timberland business is governed by federal rules and state forestry commissions, which are subject to frequent changes, thereby affecting businesses. Due to the very nature of their properties, timberland REITs are required to follow eco-friendly mandates in their trade.

332,88e0727a-5f52-3a82-b09a-22a407f8e608,WY,2023-09-12,Top 3 Stocks to Buy on Prospering Wood Industry Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-3-stocks-buy-prospering-170300685.html,1694451780,STORY,"['WY', 'TREX', '^GSPC']","[The companies under the Zacks Building Products – Wood industry are expected to benefit from higher demand across repair and remodel (R&amp;R) activity and more funding for infrastructure and carbon/ESG-related projects. Although soft demand from the residential market and a difficult macroeconomic and geopolitical environment has been hurting, the companies’ inorganic and prudent cost containment should support industry players like Weyerhaeuser Company WY, Trex Company, Inc. TREX, and Boise Cascade Company BCC.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products – Wood industry includes forest product companies and manufacturers of lumber as well as other wood products used in home construction, repair and remodeling along with the development of outdoor structures. Companies in the industry design, manufacture, source and sell flooring products like tile, wood, laminate, vinyl, and natural stone flooring products as well as decorative and installation accessories. The industry players are also involved in the manufacturing and distribution of wood and plastic composite products along with related accessories, mainly for residential decking and railing applications. The industry also includes timberland real estate investment trusts or REITs.4 Trends Shaping the Future of Building Products - Wood IndustrySpending on Carbon/ESG Projects, Repair &amp; Remodeling: The industry participants are experiencing higher funding for carbon/ESG-related projects to pursue carbon capture and storage work. The industry’s prospects are highly correlated with the U.S. housing market conditions. Although the slowing housing market and pandemic-related challenges are creating hurdles, the R&amp;R market (considered one of the largest in terms of lumber demand) has been impressive. The age of U.S. housing stock and a higher level of homeowner equity provide a favorable backdrop for repair-and-remodel spending for 2023. Also, increased government spending on infrastructure projects bodes well.Acquisitions, Product Innovation &amp; Efficient Cost-Reduction Strategies: The companies also bank on acquisitions and divestitures to expand and improve portfolio quality. New products continue to be an important top-line driver for the industry players. Also, efforts to introduce products are likely to have helped the players. Again, in a bid to reduce costs, companies have been reducing the cost structure of their facilities through Lean Six Sigma efforts, the sale or shutdown of underperforming units and manufacturing facilities, as well as investments in technology. Also, the industry players have been focusing on operational excellence, comprising merchandising for value, harvest, and transportation efficiencies and boosting harvest to capture seasonal and short-term opportunities.Lower Demand: The slowdown in the U.S. housing market has been impacting demand. Presently, the outlook for the housing industry remains less favorable compared to the last couple of years due to several headwinds, such as a rapid increase in mortgage rates, housing affordability challenges, high inflation and growing concerns about the economy. Although the residential market has started to gain momentum owing to the lack of existing homes for sale, macroeconomic uncertainties might dampen demand in the future.Rapid Lumber Market Swings &amp; Supply Chain-Related Challenges Weigh on Margins: Historically, volatility in lumber prices has been a major concern for the wood industry. Any unusual rise in the cost of lumber products sold by primary producers increases the cost of inventory and limits margins on fixed-priced lumber products. Yet, a decline in costs eats into profits as products sold are indexed to the current lumber market. Meanwhile, the timberland business is governed by federal rules and state forestry commissions, which are subject to frequent changes, thereby affecting businesses. Due to the very nature of their properties, timberland REITs are required to follow eco-friendly mandates in their trade. The companies have been experiencing supply-chain challenges and higher freight and transport costs. For example, the industry participants use a significant quantity of various resins in the manufacturing processes. Resin product costs are influenced by changes in prices or availability of raw materials used to produce resins, primarily petroleum products, and their demand and availability.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products – Wood industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Construction sector.

337,e6aa49ec-9544-34d4-b0b6-e20c9713d887,DVA,2023-09-12,Reasons to Add Integer Holdings (ITGR) Stock to Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-add-integer-holdings-itgr-163900613.html,1694450340,STORY,"['ITGR', 'MCK', 'DVA', 'HQY']","[Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR has been gaining from its improving non-medical sales. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space are expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and stiff competition continue to concern the company.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 22.7% against the 6.8% decline of the industry it belongs to. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 8.7% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device outsource manufacturer has a market capitalization of $2.68 billion. The company projects 12.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Integer Holdings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 8.4%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Improving Non-Medical Sales: We are upbeat about Integer Holdings’ improvement in its Non-Medical sales. In the second quarter of 2023, revenues at the Non-Medical Sales segment rose 6.7% year over year both on a reported and organic basis. This was driven by strong demand in military and environmental market segments.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Strong Q2 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust second-quarter 2023 results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust results by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were recorded. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin was also seen.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: Competition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Many other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: Integer Holdings’ business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials, which may be susceptible to fluctuations due to transportation issues, government regulations and price controls, among others. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, which cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of the company’s products, could adversely affect its operating results.Estimate TrendInteger Holdings is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 4.3% north to $4.33 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $374.2 million, suggesting a 9.2% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

339,c48edbaa-ba37-3bd8-88d4-d403a6c989ee,LYB,2023-09-12,Is LyondellBasell Industries N.V.'s (NYSE:LYB) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Financials In Any Way?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyondellbasell-industries-n-v-nyse-130115142.html,1694437275,STORY,['LYB'],"[LyondellBasell Industries' (NYSE:LYB) stock is up by 9.5% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:16% = US$2.1b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.LyondellBasell Industries' Earnings Growth And 16% ROEAt first glance, LyondellBasell Industries seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. However, while LyondellBasell Industries has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 3.2% . So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared LyondellBasell Industries' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 14% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for LYB? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is LyondellBasell Industries Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (where it is retaining 60% of its profits), LyondellBasell Industries has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 49% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is speculated to rise to 24% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that LyondellBasell Industries has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Valero Energy is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.33 = US$15b ÷ (US$61b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Valero Energy has an ROCE of 33%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Oil and Gas industry average of 21%. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy roceIn the above chart we have measured Valero Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEValero Energy is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 200% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Valero Energy's ROCETo bring it all together, Valero Energy has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has returned a solid 56% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Valero Energy that you might find interesting.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on UnitedHealth Group is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$30b ÷ (US$280b - US$113b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 9.5% it's much better.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for UnitedHealth Group.What Does the ROCE Trend For UnitedHealth Group Tell Us?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 81% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 18%. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesAnother thing to note, UnitedHealth Group has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 40%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.In Conclusion...To sum it up, UnitedHealth Group has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 96% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group   you'll probably want to know about.While UnitedHealth Group isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds, and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend ETFs.Investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a good investment strategy for many investors as they offer several advantages, including diversification, liquidity, and typically lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. They provide access to a wide range of asset classes, from stocks and bonds to commodities and real estate, allowing investors to create a diversified portfolio that aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance. While ETFs have grown significantly in popularity and their assets have increased substantially in recent years, they still represent only a fraction of the total global financial market. According to a report by iShares, ETFs in the US represent 12.6% of equity assets. In Europe, they account for roughly 8% of stock investments, and in the Asia-Pacific region, they represent approximately 4.2% of stock investments.That said, investors often prefer ETFs because they offer easy and convenient solutions for investing. Investors seeking income and stability in their portfolios gravitate toward dividend-focused ETFs. These funds provide a consistent stream of income through dividends paid by the underlying stocks. Additionally, many dividend ETFs focus on companies with a history of dividend growth, offering the potential for income to increase over time, which can help protect against inflation. In one of our articles on the subject published in May this year, we mentioned that there are around 180 dividend ETFs in the US, and these ETFs have a combined value of more than $384 billion.Also read: 10 Best Performing Small-cap ETFs in 2023Most dividend ETFs follow one of two strategies. The first group invests in stocks that offer high dividend payments. The second group, on the other hand, concentrates on stocks known as dividend-growth stocks. These stocks may not have extremely high dividend yields, but they come from financially stable companies that have consistently increased their dividend payments over time. Because of this, dividend-growth stocks typically show some strength during market downturns and economic slowdowns. We have previously covered various aspects of dividend growth stocks and reported that companies with strong dividend growth track records outperformed because of the compounding effect.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; GambleThe President, Jon Moeller, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.0m worth of shares at a price of US$153 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$153. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 6.1% of Jon Moeller's holding.Insiders in Procter &amp; Gamble didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Procter &amp; Gamble Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Procter &amp; Gamble shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$18m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Procter &amp; Gamble Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$183m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Procter &amp; Gamble Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Procter &amp; Gamble makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Today there are internet screeners that can provide investors with crucial information to help guide purchase or sale decisions in a matter of minutes.Investors who are seeking steady and reliable income often find it difficult to pinpoint stocks that pay a high dividend and are also performing well, as the inflated dividend is usually the result of poor performance and a wave of selling. But take a look at three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that have been crushing the competition over the past month yet still have higher dividend yields that can provide lucrative paydays to income investors.Modiv Industrial Inc. (NYSE:MDV) is a Reno, Nevada-based diversified commercial REIT, with 3.4 million square feet in 56 triple-net-leased industrial and retail single-tenant properties across 16 states. Its tenants include Dollar General, Costco and 3M. Its occupancy rate is 100%, and its weighted average lease term (WALT) is 14.3 years.On Aug. 14, Modiv reported its second-quarter operating results. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $0.31 per share was down from $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $11.84 million was up from $10.14 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Wall Street ignored the weaker AFFO numbers and focused on the revenue increase.Modiv also announced it was changing its corporate name to Modiv Industrial Inc.Modiv pays a monthly dividend of $0.095830. The dividend has remained the same since February 2022. The annual dividend yield is presently 7.72%Over the past four weeks, Modiv has gained 20.96%.Don’t miss:3 High-Yield Investments To Boost Your Portfolio’s IncomeThis REIT You’ve Never Heard Of Is Crushing The Market – Up 36% Over The Past Two YearsStory continuesSL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) is a New York City-based office REIT and the largest office building landlord in New York. As of June 30, SL Green Realty held interests in 60 buildings totaling 33.1 million square feet.Many income-oriented investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly dividend. And while pundits have speculated about possible dividend cuts for months, SL Green Realty continues to declare and pay a monthly dividend of $0.2708. The forward FFO of $5.52 easily covers the $3.25 annual dividend with a payout ratio of 58.8%, which should keep the dividend stable for some time. The annual dividend yield is presently 8.04%.On Sept. 11, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb maintained an Overweight position on SL Green Realty and raised the price target from $41 to $48.Over the past four weeks, SL Green has risen 15.86% as office REITs continue to slowly bounce back from the trouncing they took in the spring.Innovative Industrial Properties Inc.

Innovative Industrial has a 99.9% occupancy rate.Despite its recent improved performance, on Sept. 5, Compass Point analyst Merrill Ross downgraded Innovative Industrial Properties from Buy to Neutral and announced a $95 price target.Innovative Industrial Properties pays a quarterly dividend of $1.80 per share. The annual dividend of $7.20 presently yields 8.13%.A recent recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reclassify cannabis as a Schedule III substance has been supporting the cannabis sector across the board, and a change in the law would also help Innovative Industrial Properties maintain its excellent occupancy rate and subsequent rent increases.Over the past month, Innovative Industrial Properties has gained 7.65%.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

The new facility has a maturity date of Feb. 1, 2028, including a one-year extension option. The interest rate varies according to a pricing grid ranging from 2.10% to 2.60% plus SOFR, based on a company debt yield covenant. The closing interest rate is unchanged versus the existing credit facility at SOFR + 2.35%. Macerich currently has approximately $660 million of liquidity, including $498 million of availability on this newly expanded $650 million revolving credit facility.“We are extremely pleased to secure this new credit facility, especially in today’s turbulent banking market. This new facility provides an important $125 million boost to our liquidity with a fresh 4 1/2 years of extended term,” said Scott Kingsmore, Macerich Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We are very grateful for the continued support of our loyal banking relationships that made this new facility possible.”The facility and the increase in liquidity it provides come on the heels of Macerich’s announcement earlier this month of record leasing volumes, with signed leases for 2.4 million square feet year-to-date through the second quarter of 2023, which is 34% more square footage than during the same period last year. The leasing pipeline of new store openings now accounts for approximately $66 million of incremental rent in the aggregate, which will be realized in 2023, 2024 and 2025. Portfolio-wide occupancy stood at 92.6% at the end of the second quarter of 2023, a 410-basis-point gain in just over two years compared to Macerich’s pandemic-induced occupancy low of 88.5% as of March 31, 2021.Story continuesAbout MacerichMacerich is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT).

That goes against the common sense approach of buying stocks cheap and selling on the rebound. In the realm of homebuilding, a few picks may have become overvalued, leading to the rise of homebuilder stocks to sell.There’s another issue when your stocks run too good — risk. If one stock accounts for a disproportionate amount of the gains in your portfolio, it also becomes its Achilles heel. A single stock moving back down again could plunge your entire account into the red, potentially wiping out years of capital growth. That’s why it may be prudent to examine these homebuilder stocks to sell to see if they put you in a precarious situation.We might not be able to reactively time the market, but as investors, we can proactively trim our positions so that our portfolios remain balanced across different sectors. With this approach in mind, here are the top homebuilder stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) primarily engages in the homebuilding business in the United States. The company acquires and develops land mainly for residential purposes and constructs various types of housing.The stock has been in a massive bull run this year, seeing an 80% surge in its share price.Last quarter, PHM stock reported strong Q2 2023 earnings, surpassing estimates with revenues of $4.19 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.00. The firm saw a decline in its backlog by 29.3% year-over-year (YoY), but new home orders increased by 23.8%, indicating strong demand. Home sales gross margin dropped to 29.6%, while Financial Services segment revenues rose 11.4% YoY.These numbers logically predict a higher share price in the future. But in the short-term, it may be due for a correction — based on its technicals. The share price recently broke below some of its important moving averages and its momentum is currently to the downside. That helps make it one of the homebuilder stocks to sell.Story continuesD.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is a company to examine through a macro lens. Although the business showed resilience by matching EPS to cash flow effectively, high mortgage rates and inflation could be a concern.As America’s largest publicly traded home builder, DHI stock exceeded Wall Street’s Q3 earnings estimates with $3.90 a share and $9.7 billion in revenue, as reported by Barron’s. Despite raising its full-year outlook, the stock is down 5% this month, possibly due to investors taking profits after a strong first half of the year and a lack of immediate catalysts for further growth.Indeed, there is some cause for concern for DHI when one examines its technicals. Similar to PHM stock, it also broke below its long-term moving averages. Analysts also predict that its EPS will shrink 5% over the next five years. Taken together, this paints a picture of potentially irrational exuberance on behalf of investors, making it one of those homebuilder stocks to sell.NVR (NVR)The logo for NVR is seen on the top of an office building.Source: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.comNVR (NYSE:NVR) is a prominent player in the U.S. homebuilding and mortgage banking sectors, known for its unique business model focusing on land optioning rather than land ownership. That strategy minimizes capital investment, reducing financial risk and enhancing liquidity.NVR is a case of hold now, but be aware it could potentially rise to unsustainable levels later. It recently reported strong Q2 earnings, exceeding analysts’ expectations with an EPS of $116.54. Despite a revenue decrease of 12.5% YoY, the company announced a $500 million share buyback program. Meanwhile, investment firms like Smead Capital Management have increased their stake in the company.What could be keeping a lid on its share price moving upward is our environment of high inflation and high-interest rates. But as we’ve seen in the first half of this year, that hasn’t stopped the market from taking excessive risks. It might be prudent to assess if and when NVR becomes an outsized part of an investor’s portfolio and assess if its valuation is logical as it moves higher. It’s hard to lose money by consistently taking profits, even only partial ones.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Its tenants include the largest companies in the cannabis industry, such as Curaleaf, Cresco Labs, Columbia Care and Trulieve. As of June 30, it had a 100% occupancy rate.This week, Compass Point analyst Ross also downgraded NewLake Capital Partners from Buy to Neutral and announced a $15.50 price target.The downgrades of both cannabis-focused companies were somewhat surprising, given Innovative Industrial's gain of 6.16% and NewLake Capital's gain of 9.52% for the month of August.Citing a reason for the downgrades, the analyst noted that growth in earnings will continue to be elusive in 2024. But analyst Ross cited one positive factor — if marijuana is reclassified from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, that would enable marijuana operators to take advantage of income tax deductions for the first time.NewLake Capital Partners lost 1% on the day.Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc.

360,925ad087-d45b-39ad-aae6-523aba8cbc5d,FCX,2023-09-12,Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-trending-130007823.html,1694437207,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this mining company have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.7% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has lost 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -33.6%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.15 indicates a change of +32.8% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Freeport-McMoRan is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.61 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.2%. The $23.13 billion and $24.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.5% and +4.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +25%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Western U.S. Class I railroad Union Pacific expects to respond swiftly to recent remarks by the head of the Federal Railroad Administration that UP has made “poor” efforts to ensure the safety of its rolling stock, including using locomotives with safety defects and being unwilling to address those defects.UP’s actions are in response to a letter that FRA Administrator Amit Bose sent Friday to UP CEO Jim Vena, President Beth Whited and Executive Vice President of Operations Eric Gehringer on safety defects found during focused inspections in July and August.The letter also asked whether recent furloughs had any impact on safety at UP.“I am writing this letter to express serious concern about specific and significant risk to rail safety on the Union Pacific (UP). The compliance of the rolling stock (freight cars and locomotives) on the UP network is poor and UP was unwilling or unable to take steps to improve the condition of their equipment,” the letter said.UP (NYSE: UNP) told FreightWaves that it takes safety seriously and will respond to FRA this week.“Union Pacific will never compromise on the safety of our employees. Safety is always our first priority, and we are reviewing and will address the concerns raised by the FRA,” UP said. “There is no correlation between recent furloughs and Union Pacific’s ability to address mechanical repairs. We have the appropriate staffing for all crafts, and always leave a buffer to allow for the natural ebb and flow nature of our business. Finally, we have worked for years with FRA inspectors and respect the work they do. We have the same goal — safety.”Bose’s letter didn’t elaborate on what prompted the focused inspections, nor did it detail what defects were found during the inspections and whether the defects were major or minor. The letter referred to focused inspections of UP’s mechanical operations and rolling stock that occurred in July and August, but it didn’t elaborate on when and where exactly those inspections occurred other than that the results showed a defect ratio of 19.93% for UP’s freight cars and 72.69% for its locomotives. Those figures are twice the national average, Bose said.Story continuesThe letter also referred to recent furloughs of 94 locomotive craft employees, including 44 railway carmen, and questioned whether the furloughs were related to the condition of the rolling stock. “This begs the question — was UP’s failure to act to improve the condition of their rolling stock during FRA’s focused inspection a result of not having the personnel to make the necessary repairs, because of the recent furloughs?” Bose said.The letter did highlight one focused inspection that occurred at UP’s East Departure Yard in North Platte, Nebraska. FRA’s inspectors there determined that the car defect ratio was 22%, and the agency said in the letter that UP managers asked FRA inspectors to leave the yard amid disruptions to UP’s operations because of the inspections.But “with fewer qualified mechanical inspectors (QMI) to inspect locomotives and cars, FRA expresses a genuine and urgent concern that compliance with Federal Regulations will continue to decline,” Bose said. He also asked UP’s leadership to provide plans of how UP expects to address mechanical safety issues systemwide.UP has said the furloughs were due to slumping rail volumes and decreases in market demand. UP told FreightWaves Monday that it is also unsure how FRA calculated its defect ratios when other related safety data doesn’t raise flags.According to FRA, the focused inspections that occurred over the summer were a type of inspection performed routinely. These types of inspections are generally centered on a single discipline, such as track, mechanical equipment, operating practices or signals, and the focused inspections may just hone in on one part of the railroad, such as a specific geographic territory, or it might be systemwide. The focused inspections might be triggered by data trends identified by FRA, such as an increase in defects or violations, and their intent is to assess and bring a railroad into full compliance with FRA regulations.Receiving copies of Bose’s letter were Surface Transportation Board Chairman Marty Oberman and officials of six railroad unions, including unions with members who were furloughed. Both Oberman and the unions have put pressure on UP in recent years over possible correlations between reductions in employee head count and deteriorating rail service.FRA and the U.S. Department of Transportation have also been under pressure to take a more proactive stance to bolster rail safety following the Feb. 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Union Pacific furloughs workers due to lower volumesUP still working to restore tracks in Yuma subdivisionAll eyes on Vena as he takes helm at Union PacificNew labor agreements expected to cost Union Pacific millionsFederal regulators plan broad safety review of all Class I railroadsThe post Union Pacific expects to respond quickly to safety concerns raised by FRA appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(NYSE:AMP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Ameriprise FinancialThe Chairman &amp; CEO, James Cracchiolo, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$14m worth of shares at a price of US$353 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$344. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Ameriprise Financial better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Ameriprise Financial Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Ameriprise Financial. In total, insiders sold US$3.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Ameriprise Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Ameriprise Financial insiders own about US$139m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Ameriprise Financial Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Ameriprise Financial.But note: Ameriprise Financial may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.
