If you want to see more best stocks under $100, go directly to 5 Best Stocks Under $100.Stocks are very uncertain in the short term as pretty much anything can happen. Earnings can be better than expected or they can be worse than expected. Individual news events can also be better than expected or worse than expected.Currently, the market is pretty uncertain.On March 7, one news event negatively affected the market with the S&amp;P 500 declining by 1.53% to below 4000. On March 7, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.""As a result, the peak level of interest rates could be higher than previously expected. If interest rates rise too much, the economy, while currently expanding, could slow or even contract.If the economy slows substantially enough, overall corporate earnings could decline. If earnings decline too much, there could be more of a headwind for the overall stock market.While the short term is uncertain, the odds are still good that in the long term many blue chip companies with substantial competitive advantages can generate fairly decent returns.Many blue chip companies are profitable and return excess capital through dividends. For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.Many blue chip companies that are profitable also buy back stock as another way of returning capital back to shareholders. If they buy back more stock than they issue and their earnings either stays the same or increases, the buybacks will help their EPS growth.Owning one blue chip is not a high probability way of benefiting from market growth in the long term however. Management of blue chips could make a bad acquisition for instance, or they might position their company incorrectly in an important field. As a result, the overall return of an individual blue chip might not do as well in the long term even though the company has numerous competitive advantages.Story continuesOne potential way to avoid that is to have a well diversified portfolio of leading blue chip stocks across many different sectors and holding for the long term.Energy, electricity, industryPhoto by Matthew Henry on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best Stocks Under $100, we selected 15 blue chip stocks with competitive advantages that had stock prices under $100 as of the close of March 7, 2023.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.15 Best Stocks Under $10015.

If you want to see more best stocks under $100, go directly to 5 Best Stocks Under $100.Stocks are very uncertain in the short term as pretty much anything can happen. Earnings can be better than expected or they can be worse than expected. Individual news events can also be better than expected or worse than expected.Currently, the market is pretty uncertain.On March 7, one news event negatively affected the market with the S&amp;P 500 declining by 1.53% to below 4000. On March 7, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.""As a result, the peak level of interest rates could be higher than previously expected. If interest rates rise too much, the economy, while currently expanding, could slow or even contract.If the economy slows substantially enough, overall corporate earnings could decline. If earnings decline too much, there could be more of a headwind for the overall stock market.While the short term is uncertain, the odds are still good that in the long term many blue chip companies with substantial competitive advantages can generate fairly decent returns.Many blue chip companies are profitable and return excess capital through dividends. For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.Many blue chip companies that are profitable also buy back stock as another way of returning capital back to shareholders. If they buy back more stock than they issue and their earnings either stays the same or increases, the buybacks will help their EPS growth.Owning one blue chip is not a high probability way of benefiting from market growth in the long term however. Management of blue chips could make a bad acquisition for instance, or they might position their company incorrectly in an important field. As a result, the overall return of an individual blue chip might not do as well in the long term even though the company has numerous competitive advantages.Story continuesOne potential way to avoid that is to have a well diversified portfolio of leading blue chip stocks across many different sectors and holding for the long term.Energy, electricity, industryPhoto by Matthew Henry on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best Stocks Under $100, we selected 15 blue chip stocks with competitive advantages that had stock prices under $100 as of the close of March 7, 2023.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.15 Best Stocks Under $10015.

That's what a team of U.S. Bank employees did recently in order to gain new perspectives about people with disabilities and enjoy healthy competition.The four employees competed in the inaugural Play for Inclusion 3v3 Wheelchair Basketball Charitable Tournament. Sponsored by The Ability Center, the event brought together teams from across the Greater Milwaukee area for accessibility-inclusive play to benefit the center's programs.The team was sponsored by the U.S. Bank Global Disability business resource group, and members were recruited by Global Disability board chair Kelly Risser. The team included Wealth Management and Investment Services employees Mike Dahm, Steph Parise, Dana Armour and Josue Rodriguez, who worked to quickly adapt their skills and compete.To level the tournament playing field, all participating teams were made up of players who The Ability Center founder Damian Buchman refers to as temporarily able-bodied (TAB) individuals. Buchman has said he learned at a young age that we all are borrowing a body today that will not work the same tomorrow, and he believes TABs are the one demographic we all belong to.Through the tournament, TAB players were able to experience the game of basketball from the perspective of athletes with physical disabilities.""During the opening ceremony, Damian described the wheelchair as our pair of shoes for the day. It was humbling to be in someone else's shoes and get out of our comfort zone,"" Parise said.""We were timid to start as we were challenged with figuring out how to dribble, navigate the others around us and find the best way to get in shooting range,"" she said. ""But by the end, we were aggressive and strategically navigating the floor.""Story continuesThe Milwaukee-based Ability Center aims to provide everyone with a daily opportunity to be fit, active and healthy, and play together. It also envisions building communities where all abilities are provided a universal opportunity for health, wellness and recreation.U.S. Bank supports The Ability Center on its goal of transforming the Milwaukee area into one of the most accessible and inclusive recreation locations in the world.The team learned that the wheelchairs created an environment of equivalence, where height and age didn't matter. And with a record of two games won and two games lost, the team members were proud competitors.Though the team didn't bring the championship trophy back to U.S. Bank, everyone enjoyed the experience and developed some new skills along the way.""The biggest takeaway for the day wasn't in the score; it was in the experience,"" Parise said.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Vice Chairman of Consumer &amp; Business Banking, Timothy Welsh, for US$834k worth of shares, at about US$43.92 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$45.49, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 26% of Timothy Welsh's holding.In the last year U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$124m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At U.S. Bancorp Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of U.S. Bancorp insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

These field locations, distribution centers and corporate facilities combine for about 23 million square feet of space that requires heating, cooling and appropriate lighting.Cintas identified an opportunity to decrease energy use by installing LED lights at its older, more energy-intensive locations, and initiated the company-wide LED transition project in FY'19.Cintas' Quality and Engineering Team completed LED installations at more than 125 locations by the end of the company's fiscal year 2022, and entered the current fiscal year with fewer than 50 target facilities remaining in the current phase.""We've already installed LED lighting in over 6 million square feet of space in our facilities, which is poised to reduce our annual energy use by almost 23.3 million kilowatt hours going forward,"" said Christy Nageleisen, Cintas' Vice President of ESG.More than 27,000 incandescent and fluorescent lighting fixtures have been swapped out, and the energy savings generated by the LEDs represents more than 16,500 metric tons of CO2 emissions averted annually.VIDEO (YouTube): Cintas Uses LED Lighting Conversions to Reduce Energy RequirementsA Strategic PlanThe lighting transition project is part of Cintas' strategic ambition to achieve Net Zero GHG emissions by 2050.""We're not waiting until 2050 to start,"" said Mark Bolen, Cintas Vice President of Quality &amp; Engineering. ""We're looking at all avenues to see where it makes the most sense, where our dollar has the best return, and it's not just lighting. It's being better environmental stewards.""Cintas reduced its energy consumption intensity by 7.9% from FY'21 to FY'22, which included the expanding impact of the LED lighting transition project.Story continuesA Comprehensive ApproachCintas' facility-focused energy reductions go beyond LED lighting conversions.""Sustainability and energy efficiency plays a key role for us, primarily because our products are delicate and they require a lot of attention that we provide to our customers,"" Bolen said. ""Engineering is constantly looking at ways to find equipment that is more reliable - more energy efficient - to ultimately reduce our reliance on energy.""To that end, Cintas is exploring opportunities to test solar technology. Working with the state of New Jersey, Cintas identified the opportunity to install its first solar-powered system at the company's Rental location in Piscataway, N.J.The project is underway and is expected to be fully installed and operational in the late spring of 2023. Once online and connected to the energy grid, Cintas' first solar system installation will allow the company to evaluate its year-round performance and compare the costs with traditional utility-based energy sources.Cintas' Engineering Team and its Facility Team area also evaluating other energy- and water-reduction capabilities for its existing and future facilities.Some Cintas facilities currently have various energy-reduction technologies installed, including entrances with multiple doors, timing mechanisms on the HVAC and lighting systems, water-flow reducers and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roofs and ceilings made of lighter-colored materials to reflect radiant heat.Additionally, all new Cintas buildings constructed since 2017 have been built with LED lighting systems installed.

Start your free 7-day trial to get this news first.Tesla shares down on Berenberg downgradeTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell 3% yesterday after Berenberg downgraded the company to Hold from Buy with a price target of $210.00 (from $200.00) as it believes the upside is limited following the year-to-date outperformance.The analyst sees the recent price cuts as an investment in growth. Tesla is increasingly focused on volumes, which will mean near-term margins are sacrificed. “This positions them competitively against new electric vehicle (EV) launches as the Berlin and Austin plants ramp up, replicating elements of Shanghai’s low-cost processes,” said the firm.Long-term, Berenberg remains bullish on the company and highlights the “significant” opportunity in the smaller vehicle segment.Etsy downgraded at Jefferies, shares fallEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) shares fell more than 6% premarket today after Jefferies downgraded the company to Underperform from Buy and cut its price target to $85.00 from $150.00 as it believes the company's 70% valuation premium to Internet appears unsustainable given below average EBITDA growth and risk of downside to consensus.""Buyers are churning faster and spending less on ETSY, forcing marketing higher and putting pressure on EBITDA. With more limited take rate upside and deteriorating buyer trends, we see downside to consensus from slowing top line and moderating margin expansion,"" said the firm.3 more negative rating moves Wells Fargo downgraded Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) to Equal Weight from Overweight and cut its price target to $78.00 from $97.00, based on lower tricuspid sales, the limited upside to TAVR market growth, TAVR share loss, and the slow ramp of Pascal.On TAVR market growth, the firm said it sees limited upside with EW growing below market due to increasing competition.Story continuesShares closed 2% lower yesterday.Deutsche Bank downgraded Centene (NYSE:CNC) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $79.00 from $94.00 as it is increasingly concerned that the risk of redeterminations and the risks to Medicare Advantage membership/profits are not fully reflected in the share price or consensus estimates.“Even as the shares are down sharply YTD, we foresee a significant negative future revision both to guidance and Street estimates in the future that creates a risk for the shares,” said the firm.Bernstein initiated coverage on Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) with an Underperform rating and a price target of $4.00.The Global Distribution System (GDS), remains the company’s primary revenue source, comprising 70% of its revenue. However, Bernstein noted that increased competition and technological changes are expected to result in a dilution of market share and margins for incumbent GDSs. Although Sabre's Air IT and Hospitality businesses (20% and 10% of revenue respectively) are smaller, they “are better,” according to the brokerage.“Debt is too high, with interest costs exceeding EBITDA in 2023, and will continue to constrain the company's ability to invest in development - worsening the competitive gap to larger peer Amadeus,” added the firm.Shares fell more than 3% yesterday.Related Articles5 big analyst cuts: Tesla stock slumps on Berenberg downgrade | Pro RecapSVB Financial Group plunges on $1.75B share saleCredit Suisse delays annual report after SEC call, shares drop]"

Our core business delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter despite the macroeconomic and industry specific challenges that companies across our industry continued to fix. Our strong market share position and proactive cost management actions helped to offset weaker end market demand as well as the ongoing impact of reduced orders from our customers as retailers continue to focus on rightsizing their inventory levels. Our proactive efforts to reduce costs restructure our European operations and identify efficiencies throughout the business drove improved gross margins and continued strong free cash flow generation in a dynamic operating environment with gross margins exceeding both analysts and our own internal estimates. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $207 million in net sales and $19.7 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to $255.9 million in net sales and [$30.9 million] in adjusted EBITDA for the 2021 period. These results reflect the challenges that persisted throughout the quarter, but it is important to keep in mind that while the overall U.S. market is down, Lifetime continues to perform well in comparison to the market and its industry peers. For the full year, our strong execution in a challenging environment enabled us to generate adjusted EBITDA of $58.2 million compared with $95.1 million in 2021. As we move into 2023, we're seeing the inventory buildup at major retailers start to abate and signs of a turnaround in order flow with a more normalization expected in the second quarter of 2023. Also, while inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors, including the war in Ukraine, continue to significantly impact demand in Europe in the fourth quarter. The restructuring of our international operations is now complete, and we expect that this will drive improved profitability moving forward, which I'll speak more about later on. In our core U.S. business, it is important to note that we maintained our market share gains from the last several years. While our revenue is down, we have not lost distribution in our core business. During the holiday season, we saw a decline in discretionary spending from consumers which resulted in a more disappointing holiday season at retail across Lifetime's chance, especially at our largest customers. This decline in consumer spending was felt across the industry as large retailers saw reduced end market demand as a result of inflation and other factors. But the larger driver of revenue declines in the quarter continued to be reduced orders from retailers as our largest customers continue to rightsize their inventory. As a result, our point-of-sale data again exceeded shipments in the fourth quarter. While we're encouraged by the signs of a turnaround in order flow, we began to see this quarter in customer orders, we have yet to see full normalization in order flow. As shipments increase with a normalizing market, we expect there will be a corresponding impact to bottom line growth. Now turning to our international business. We gained market share in Europe throughout 2022, and our international business outside of Europe remains profitable. However, we also continue to see the sustained impact of the current economic environment on consumer demand in Europe and, to a lesser extent, Asia Pacific, exacerbated by the War in Ukraine and the impact of Brexit on the U.K. economy, which resulted in another tough quarter for retailers and in turn, for our European business. As a reminder, our U.K. business represents over 75% of our international business. As we discussed last quarter, we took an important step in response to these pressures by implementing a restructuring of our Europe-based international operations. We're pleased to report that this restructuring was fully implemented in the fourth quarter and we expect to see a meaningful increase in profitability in the international business in 2023 as a result. We don't expect the market demand to increase or normalize in the near-term, which is why the decision to restructure this business was so important. Over the past several years, we've rebuilt our European business from the ground up, and this additional restructuring will allow us to fully realize that benefits in the coming years. In Asia Pacific, we also implemented a change to our go-to-market strategy. We have substantially eliminated all third-party distribution agents in major geographies and replace them with lifetime country managers, consistent with our direct selling strategy. This is an important change and will ensure we're operating with the highest efficiency and profitability across the markets we serve. We continue to make progress on our other strategic growth initiatives. Global e-commerce sales as a percentage of revenues improved to 19.8% in the fourth quarter, although still lower on a dollar sales basis than our peak levels during the heart of the pandemic. We remain focused on expanding our e-commerce business, which is an important growth driver for lifetime, and we continue to make great progress in both our core U.S. market as well as international. During the fourth quarter, Mikasa Hospitality continued to gain traction, and we believe we are poised for meaningful growth in the division in 2023. We continue to expect our foodservice business of Mikasa Hospitality and Taylor, who reach $30 million in revenues by the end of 2023 and continue to see this as a $60 million business by 2026. Given our strong cash position, M&amp;A activity remains a potential avenue for accretive growth. And we are focused on strategic opportunities in our core product areas or adjacent categories where we have an opportunity to leverage our global scale and/or tap into a new product category. We have a robust pipeline of potential value enhancing opportunities in the market, and we will continue to be opportunistic and extremely disciplined with our use of capital. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation. Turning now to our cost management efforts. Overall operating expenses were favorable on a dollar basis in the quarter, although unfavorable on a percentage basis due to a decrease in revenues. Last quarter, Larry spoke about the high labor expenses we were experiencing due to wage increases and less efficient use of labor. We are focused on lowering these costs and this quarter, we successfully reduced distribution expenses by $4.6 million, driven primarily by an ongoing labor efficiency program. Excluding charges for bad debt expense and incremental costs related to S'well. We also saw reductions in SG&amp;A this quarter due to the effective management of discretionary spending, as well as an effort to reduce operating cost infrastructure. Active balance sheet management remained a key focus for us this quarter. By the end of 2022, we had rightsized our own inventory levels, which aided our achievement of historically high levels of liquidity as of the end of 2022. Larry will speak more about our balance sheet and liquidity as well. We also expect a cost benefit from the retirement of Jeffrey Siegel, who has been serving as our Executive Chairman. The Executive Chairman role was created in conjunction with Lifetime's merger with Filament Brands in 2018. Jeff will continue to serve in the role of non-Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors. And we look forward to continuing to benefit from his guidance, deep knowledge of the business and ongoing leadership of our Board. Looking ahead, we continue to have limited visibility into certain macroeconomic factors that will impact our business, but we believe the company will outperform 2022 results in the year ahead. We intend to provide full 2023 guidance, as we normally do, when we report our first quarter results. In the meantime, let me provide some color on what is driving our fundamentals in the business as it stands today.Global supply chains, including ocean freight costs, have fully normalized since the pandemic. And as I mentioned, we do expect normalization of customer ordering patterns and improved profitability from our restructured international business in 2023. We have a strong balance sheet at a time of relative economic uncertainty. And our business model continues to prove resilient. I am confident we are well-positioned to drive shareholder value and get back on track with our long-term growth trajectory in 2023. We are proud to have achieved another year of progress for lifetime and grateful to our talented team for all their hard work during these challenging times. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Larry to discuss our financial results in more detail.Laurence WinokerThanks, Rob. As we reported this morning, net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3.3 million or $0.15 per diluted share versus a loss of $600,000 or $0.03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of '21. Adjusted net income was $4.7 million for the fourth quarter, $0.22 per diluted share compared to $14.4 million or $0.65 per diluted share in '21. Income from operations was $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of '22 as compared to $8.9 million in the '21 period. Adjusted net income from operations for the fourth quarter of '22 was $14.4 million compared to $24.5 million in the '21 period. And adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 was $58.2 million before credit agreement limitations. Adjusted net income, adjusted income from operations and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to our GAAP financial measures in the earnings release. Following comments are for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, unless stated otherwise. Net sales, consolidated net sales declined by 19% from 2021. As Rob discussed, high retail inventory levels adversely affected our shipments in the current quarter and high inflation and other economic factors contributed to a weaker end market demand, especially in Europe and Asia Pacific markets. U.S. segment sales decreased by 60% to $193 million. The decrease occurred in all distribution channels. This was attributable to lower replenishment orders as retailers continue to reduce their weeks of supply on hand. In addition, retail sales declined as consumers shifted their spending to services from goods, including housewares. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of S'well, which we acquired in March. International segment sales were down $11.6 million or $8.3 million and constant USD to $14.1 million. The decrease was due to similar factors as was experienced in the U.S. This was exacerbated by the impact of higher food and energy inflation in Europe, which experienced substantially reduced consumer discretionary spending. In addition, a decrease in Asia as we move away from a distributor agent model to a more direct selling one. Gross margin increased to 35.9% from 34.4% last year. For the U.S. segment, gross margin increased 35.8% from 34.9%. The improvement is due to lower inbound freight costs. For international, gross margin increased to 37.1% from 30.3%. The improvement reflected an increase in selling prices, lower duties -- lower duty on goods imported directly to the EU versus to the U.K. an ongoing benefit of distributing to U.K. -- excuse me, to EU customers from the Netherlands warehouse and some favorable customer mix. In distribution, U.S. segment distribution expense as a percent of good shift from its warehouses was 9.2% versus 8.2% last year. The increase was driven by lower sales, resulting in under-absorption of fixed expenses and higher storage costs due to higher inventory on hand. This increase was partially offset by the benefit of higher revenue per carton, reduced variable labor, our continuous labor efficiency efforts and lower general expenses. In the International segment, the distribution expense as a percent of good shift from its warehouses was 19.6% versus 23.1% last year. The improvement was due to lower outbound freight as goods for EU customers are now shipped from the Netherlands. The prior year included a warehouse occupancy tax adjustment. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased less than 1% in the 2022 quarter. U.S. segment expenses increased $3.7 million to $32.3 million, primarily due to an increase in sales support expense, the inclusion of S'well and a higher allowance for bad debt. For international, SG&amp;A expenses decreased by $1.5 million to $3.8 million on lower headcount, lower allowances for bad debt and an operating net foreign currency gain. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $1.9 million to $4.3 million on lower incentive compensation and restructuring in the 2022 period, the company recorded $1 million for restructuring expenses related to the elimination of certain senior executive positions. We expect this action will result in annual savings of approximately $1.3 million. Also in the period, [$400,000] of restructuring expenses were recorded for severance associated with the reorganization of the International segment's workforce. The reorganization was a result of the realignment of management and the operating structure of the European business in response to a change in market conditions. The company expects annual savings of $2.3 million from this reorganization. Interest expense increased by $1.2 million due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt and the effective income tax rate for 2022 exceeded the statutory rate primarily due to foreign losses, which no benefits recognized partially offset by an R&amp;D tax credit. Related to our Group of Vasconia investment, a 24% equity-owned investee. The company recorded a loss of $2.1 million in 2022 quarter versus earnings of $600,000 in 2021. Vasconia's results were negatively affected in its houseware business similarly to our U.S. and international segments. In addition, it was also adversely affected by lower demand in its aluminum business, which was exacerbated by the extremely high cost of aluminum procured in early 2022 which resulted from the Russia, Ukraine war. On a very positive note, our liquidity continues to be very strong. As of year-end, it was at an all-time high of approximately $200 million which was comprised of $23.6 million of cash plus availability under our credit facility. And while liquidity was enhanced by an increase in our credit facility commitment, we achieved this level by actively managing -- actively managing our inventory down by $48 million during the year and without reducing selling prices in this challenging business environment. Furthermore, $80 million of liquidity was used to purchase the S'well business and approximately $6 million was used to repurchase our common stock. At December 31, '22, our net debt was $232.7 million, and the net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 4x. This concludes our prepared comments. Operator, please open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin ducting or question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserSo it's good to hear the news about some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the inventory reductions by the retailers. So I was wondering if you could -- being that you've got a couple of months in the first quarter under your belt. Is it fair to say that the sales decline that you'll have in the first quarter of 2023, might be a little less than what we saw as a decline in the fourth quarter. Is that the way to think about it?Robert Bruce KayWell, the quarter is not over, but that is a good way to think.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And then I kind of thought you were hinting around that maybe sales could be up year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023. Did I understand that correctly?Robert Bruce KaySo in our core U.S. business, right, we do believe there will be a continued normalization of inventory levels, and we'll see more of a benefit from the second quarter onwards than we would in the first quarter.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And then I was just curious about your own inventory level, which you reduced it, as you said, quite a bit in 2022. Are you feeling comfortable that that's an appropriate level now? Or do you think we'll see some further reduction in inventory as we go through 2023?Robert Bruce KayWe do feel is an appropriate level. There will be some additional reduction in '23. In the core U.S. business and in Europe, the foodservice business will continue to grow inventory to support the growth in that business.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And just since you mentioned the food service business, it sounds like that's really kind of ramping up quite nicely. Is that industry back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the opening of restaurants and whatnot? Or are we still -- or is that industry still below the pre-pandemic levels?Robert Bruce KaySo the industry had a tremendous 2022. There's a lot of -- so it's different. So first of all, there's more challenged vendors in the industry financially [sell], actually good opportunity for us and we're picking up share as a result because there are people who can't perform. New openings are not quite as good, but people had delayed purchases for many years. And those -- there's pent-up demand on the hotel side, there's a lot more opening than there have been in the past couple of years. So we're seeing a tremendous boost from that. Of course, the restaurants in the hotels.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And then I was wondering also you had mentioned a while back some particular brand programs with Walmart, I believe, new product lines -- can you just update us on how those initiatives are going? And is there anything kind of new plan for 2023?Robert Bruce KayIn Walmart, the biggest new brand offering was the beautiful with [True Value] more brands. And there's 3 pieces to that. One is tools. Second, it's cutlery. And we already have had for a long time very large leading branded market placement at Walmart, the Farberware in both of those categories. The tools haven't been selling so great. They've been kind of disappointing, frankly. The Cutlery has been very good. Very happy with that as is Walmart. And the tabletop stop more dinnerware than anything else, will enter in 2023 in our likelihood. We actually -- while we are a very large tabletop supplier, as you know, don't sell anything prior to this to Walmart. So it's all incremental opportunity.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And then finally, I just had one question about your e-commerce sales. You mentioned that number pretty specifically. I was just curious if all of your pretty much almost all of your e-commerce sales are through like Amazon and other type of retailers like that? Or do you have a certain percentage of your sales that are through your own websites like DTC sales?Robert Bruce KayYes. So the majority of those sales both here and internationally or in Europe are through pure-play e-commerce with Amazon being the guy in Asia Pacific, Amazon isn't the major player. So for instance, in China, Tmall which would be our biggest outlet there. But we have been growing and growing profitably our own branded transactional websites continue to grow again this year. And our own websites for the full year, approximately $30 million, a little south of $30 million growth year-over-year versus and that would be the [2022] number.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. I'll pass it on.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski with Sidoti &amp; Company.Anthony Chester LebiedzinskiSo first, looking at the fourth quarter results, I just wanted to get a better perspective for demand for your different product categories, kitchenware, tableware, home solutions. Just wondering if demand was consistent or did you see any variations in your demand levels?Robert Bruce KayNo. And again, the biggest impact on us has been the over-inventory situation at wholesale. And that affects everything. So when there isn't open to buy or too much at, it depends on channel by channel how it works. They're not buying anything or cutting back on anything and it's across the board. It doesn't have to be that the over inventory on your products. That situation is impacting your products even if it doesn't you aren't over in inventory at retail.Anthony Chester LebiedzinskiOkay. Got you. Okay. And then just in terms of the commentary about the second quarter. So is that when you expect the point of sales -- point-of-sale data to match the shipment data. Is that a fair way.Robert Bruce KayYes, look. I mean we do mention that we are looking positively at 2023, but we do also mention that there's very poor visibility we also do know we're very close with our customer base in terms of the inventory situation and what's at in their DCs or in their club or whatever it's going to be. So there is the need but we can't definitively put a date on things at this point.Anthony Chester LebiedzinskiUnderstood. Okay. And then in terms of the European restructuring, can you guys quantify how much you expect in savings from that initiative?Robert Bruce KayYou're talking about in Europe?Anthony Chester LebiedzinskiYes, please. Yes.Laurence WinokerYes, it's Larry. Yes, we said it should be about $2.3 million, $400,000 restructuring. Some of these savings will come from attrition and less warehouse labor. So again, a big bang for the buck than we -- that's international, yes.Robert Bruce KayAnd we have executed it completely. So there's no additional work to be done on the structure.Anthony Chester LebiedzinskiOkay. And then so you repurchased about 6.3 million shares of your stock. What is your appetite?Laurence WinokerWell, just to clarify, we bought back $6.3 million of stock, that's 6.3 million shares. I know you met that, but just to clarify.Robert Bruce KayWe're currently on hold in that program, we'll reassess it as the year goes on.Anthony Chester LebiedzinskiOkay. Got it. All right. Well, best of luck.Robert Bruce KayThank you, Anthony.OperatorThere are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.Robert Bruce KayOkay. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate people's continued interest and support of Lifetime Brands. We look forward to continued communication and we look forward to people joining us on our first quarter conference call coming up [very soon]. Thank you. Have a great day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.]"

At $98 a year, Walmart+ costs $41 less than Prime and offers many of the same perks, such as shipping discounts and video streaming. Walmart’s subscription service also has benefits Amazon can’t match, including discounted fuel at gas stations around the US.In February, 28% of US households with annual income of at least $150,000 were members of Walmart+, up from 13% a year earlier, according to Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics, which conducts monthly consumer surveys. Amazon Prime still has a commanding lead with 77% of those households, up 7 percentage points from the previous year.Walmart’s inroads with this cohort mirror what’s been happening in its stores as the company gradually sheds its reputation as a destination for lower- and middle-income shoppers. Attracting and hanging onto wealthier customers is now a key priority for the company, and executives see e-commerce as a big selling point.Walmart+ is benefiting from the same “flywheel” effect Amazon experienced when it launched Prime in 2005: As Walmart attracts more shoppers, it lures more brands, which in turn bring in even more shoppers.Besides borrowing Amazon’s online playbook, Walmart is capitalizing on a network of stores located within 10 miles of 90% of Americans. Shoppers can pick up online orders from their closest Walmart. America’s largest grocer also has a decided advantage in fresh food, a market Amazon has been trying to crack for years. Walmart+ offers members free delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon last month raised its free grocery delivery threshold to orders of at least $150.Story continues“Walmart is eating into Amazon’s e-commerce market share and legitimately becoming a competitor,” said Alasdair McLean-Foreman, founder and chief executive officer of Teikametrics, a Boston-based software firm that helps merchants buy advertising on Amazon, Walmart and other platforms. “People are seeing Walmart as a viable marketplace, and that wasn’t the case in 2019 or 2020.”To be clear, Amazon remains the undisputed king of online commerce in its home market. US shoppers will spend $431 billion on Amazon this year, almost six times the $74 billion they’ll spend on Walmart, according to Insider Intelligence. Walmart is expected to have 6.3% of the US online market this year, a fraction of Amazon’s estimated 37.6% share.Still, Walmart is gradually gaining on Amazon. In 2020 the company surpassed EBay Inc. as the second largest e-commerce player in the US. And there are signs that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will continue to gain momentum. Walmart+ members skew younger than Amazon Prime members, a promising trend for Walmart if it can hang on to them. About 65% of Walmart+ members are between 18 and 44 years old, compared with 51% for Amazon Prime, according to Prosper.Walmart+ has plenty of room to grow. About 11 million US shoppers are “very likely” to subscribe to the service, adding to the approximately 18.5 million existing members, according to a February survey conducted by Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime had 168 million members in the US as of December, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.Amazon spokesman Bradley Mattinger disputed that the subscription service has stopped growing. “Prime membership continues to grow — in the US and worldwide — as the value members receive continues to increase,” he said.Walmart’s online advertising business is a fraction the size of Amazon’s. But here, too, Walmart has an advantage because it can provide brands with data on how shoppers spend not just online but also in stores, said Sreenath Reddy, the founder and CEO of Intentwise, which helps clients place ads on web marketplaces. Walmart.com is also less crowded than Amazon.com, with about 135,000 merchants compared with some 2 million on Amazon. That makes it easier for brands to stand out on Walmart, he said.“I think Walmart+ is about more than just handing savings to people,” Reddy said. “It’s connecting the online and offline world in a way that wasn’t possible before.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNaples, Florida, Sees a Rush of New Money—But City Workers Are Getting Priced OutFree IRS TurboTax Competitor Is Closer After Biden FundingThe German Startup Racing Uber to Uber-ize TrucksThe Digital Age Ushers in a Speedier, More Viral Breed of Bank RunThe SVB Collapse Threatens an Already Fragile Economy©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Shares have lost about 4.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Xylem due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Xylem Beats on Q4 Earnings &amp; RevenuesXylem fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings (excluding 10 cents from non-recurring items) of 92 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents.

Organic sales in the quarter rose 20%.Orders in the reported quarter decreased 9% year over year. Organically, orders decreased by 3% owing to currency differences.Segmental DetailsRevenues in the Water Infrastructure segment were $668 million, up 7% year over year. Organic sales in the reported quarter grew 15% year over year, buoyed by effective price realization, healthy activity in the utility business in the United States and Western Europe and dewatering demand in emerging markets.The Applied Water segment generated revenues of $455 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% year over year. Organic sales increased 17% on a year-over-year basis. The segmental performance benefited from strong price realization in all end markets and regions.Quarterly revenues at the Measurement &amp; Control Solutions segment were $383 million, up 30% year over year. Organic sales were up 35% year over year due to strength in the water quality test and pipeline assessment applications as well as improved chip supply.Margin ProfileIn the reported quarter, Xylem’s adjusted EBITDA was $281 million, up 31.3% from the year-ago quarter’s level. The margin in the quarter improved to 18.7% compared with 16.2% in the year-ago period.Adjusted operating income was $214 million in the quarter under review, up 46% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $5.86 billion.Adjusted EBITDA margin is predicted to be in the range of 17.5-18%, reflecting an increase of 50-100 basis points year over year. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the band of $3.00-$3.25, indicating a rise of 5-14% from the 2022 reported number. The mid-point of the guided range — $3.13 — lies below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.19.  Free cash flow conversion to net income is estimated to be 100%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Xylem has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B.

With the uncertainty of interest rate policy, inflation, and unemployment markets seem to be waiting for some clear signal on where to go next.Amid the choppiness, the semiconductors industry has unequivocally outperformed the market recently.Year to date, the semiconductor ETF SMH has climbed 22%, massively outperforming the 5% return in the S&amp;P 500.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis strong performance comes after a grueling 2022, where SMH experienced a near -50% drawdown, and some individual stocks were down more than that. Three factors enabled this rebound; economic growth remained robust, Fed policy became more dovish, and semiconductor stocks were oversold and trading at a discount.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewWhether these factors will continue to aid in the strength of the semiconductor stocks is unknown, but focusing on leading sectors, with improving earnings, is one effective way to trade markets. Here I will share two highly-ranked semiconductor stocks to consider buying in March.Cadence Design SystemsCadence Design Systems CDNS offers products and tools that help customers design electronic products. Through System Design Enablement (SDE) strategy the company offers software, hardware, services, and reusable designs for electronic systems and semiconductor customers. Cadence has an extremely diversified hardware product portfolio and is expanding its software offerings.CDNS is likely to benefit from long-term secular mega-trends which boosts design activity growth across semiconductor and system companies.Cadence Design Systems stock currently has an extremely compelling setup. CDNS stock just broke out of a massive technical consolidation. The last nine weeks show consistent institutional buying which has pushed the stock to new all-time highs.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAdditionally, CDNS has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. The uptrend is evident in the chart below.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCDNS sales haven’t missed a beat, and current quarter sales are expected to jump 12% to $1 billion, while earnings are expected to climb 7% to $1.25 per share. The current year’s estimates are even stronger, with sales projected to grow 13.4% to $4 billion and earnings expected to grow 16.4% to $4.97 per share.Analysts are in unanimous agreement in revising earnings expectations higher and all timeframes have been revised higher by as much as 25%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCDNS has been a phenomenally strong stock over the long-term as well. Over the last ten years Candence Design Systems has compounded at an annual rate of 30%, nearly 3x that of the S&amp;P 500’s 12% average. That outperformance has rocketed CDNS stock up 1300% over that time.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCDNS does not come cheap. With such strong expectations, the stock is currently trading at 50x one-year forward earnings, although this is still below its three-year median of 55x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrochip TechnologyMicrochip Technology MCHP develops, manufactures, and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. MCHP has a comprehensive product portfolio serving over 120,000 customers across the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, and computing industries.MCHP boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 20% to $2.2 billion, and earnings are projected to grow 19% to $1.61 per share over the same period. Full-year sales are expected to be $8.4 billion, a 24% YoY increase, while earnings are expected to climb 30% to $5.99 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalysts are in near unanimous agreement in upgrading MCHP’s earnings estimates over the last two months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMCHP has an intriguing technical setup as well. Just this week the stock broke out of a bull flag, indicating strong upward momentum. So long as the stock continues to trade above $82 per share, the setup remains intact.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewMicrochip Technology is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14x, below its five-year median of 17x, and below the industry average of 18x. MCHP also offers a dividend yield of 1.8%, which it increased 40% over the last year.With a much more reasonable valuation than CDNS, these two picks allow for a complimentary mix of semiconductor stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionSemiconductor stocks are clearly benefiting from momentum. Sometimes in markets strength begets more strength, and that is clearly happening here. When trading momentum, you want to be sure to stick with what works and drop what doesn’t. The best momentum stocks can go up and feel like they’re never going to stop, but they eventually do. Be mindful of your position sizing, set a trailing stop-loss, and respect your trading plan.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Palm Oil Companies In The World.The palm oil industry has become a major global economic force in recent years, with production and consumption increasing rapidly. The industry has been particularly successful in Southeast Asia, where large-scale oil palm plantations have been established in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. These two countries are the largest producers of palm oil, accounting for around 84% of global production. Other major producing countries include Nigeria, Thailand, and Colombia.According to Grand View Research, the global market for palm oil was valued at $67.3 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% from 2023 to 2030. As per Index Mundi, in 2022, Indonesia and Malaysia were the leading exporters of palm oil, while India, China, the EU, and Pakistan remained the leading importers. As you will find out, most companies in our list also have either Malaysian or Indonesian origins.In the first half of 2022, the demand for palm oil witnessed a surge due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The fighting countries are two of the world's largest producers of sunflower oil, and their conflict led to an abrupt global shortage of sunflower oil while increasing the global demand for its substitute i.e., palm oil. The Indonesian government had to ban the exports of palm oil in 2022 for a brief period to control the surging prices of domestic cooking oils.Biggest Palm Oil Companies In The WorldPalm Oil Industry OutlookFor 2023, Fitch forecasts that palm oil demand will grow due to Indonesia’s decision to encourage the use of palm oil-based fuel in diesel. In January 2022, Indonesia’s President, Joko Widodo, stated that Indonesia and Malaysia would remain together and ""strengthen cooperation through the council of palm oil producing countries"". This statement is widely viewed as a response to the European Union's plans to phase out palm oil-based fuels by 2030 due to concerns about deforestation.Story continuesEnvironmental ConcernsWhile palm oil is a popular crop, its negative impact on the environment, particularly deforestation, has become more widely recognized. The establishment of palm oil plantations often leads to the clearing of forests, resulting in the loss of important wildlife habitats and carbon sinks. To address these concerns, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was established in 2004. The RSPO is a multi-stakeholder initiative that sets standards for sustainable palm oil production and offers certification for companies that meet those standards. In recent years, the RSPO has seen a growth in the number of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) producers. As per RSPO’s 2021 Impact Report, the production and consumption of CSPO increased by 5.7% in 2021, with the total number of certified volumes increasing to 14.7 million metric tonnes. As you will see in the list, most of the companies included are also certified by RSPO.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 12 biggest palm oil companies in the world, we used stock screeners to identify the biggest publicly traded palm oil companies by market cap. For private companies, we browsed through industry research papers and other similar articles on the internet to identify the biggest private names.

Its next monetary policy meeting is planned for March 21-22.""Oil prices are fluctuating wildly on renewed fears of Fed interest rate increases,"" said Price Group analyst Phil Flynn.A strengthening dollar is also making oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.Global shares, which often move in tandem with oil prices, hit a two-month low as investors dumped banks.Broader U.S. employment data for February beat expectations with nonfarm payrolls rising by 311,000, compared with expectations of 205,000 jobs added, according to a Reuters survey. This is likely to ensure that the Fed will raise interest rates for longer, which analysts have said would weigh on oil prices.On the supply side, major oil producers Saudi Arabia and Iran, both members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, re-established ties after days of previously undisclosed talks in Beijing.U.S. oil rigs fell by 2 to 590 this week, their lowest since June, according to data from Baker Hughes.The United States was reported to have privately urged some commodity traders to shed concerns about shipping price-capped Russian oil in a bid to shore up supply.Story continuesInvestors are closely monitoring export cuts from Russia, which decided to trim oil output by 500,000 barrels per day in March.On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a budget that would scrap billions of dollars in oil and gas industry subsidies.Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Feb. 21, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.(Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla, Sudarshan Varadhan and Muyu Xu in Singapore; Editing by Louise Heavens, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and David Gregorio)]"

If you want to see more best stocks under $100, go directly to 5 Best Stocks Under $100.Stocks are very uncertain in the short term as pretty much anything can happen. Earnings can be better than expected or they can be worse than expected. Individual news events can also be better than expected or worse than expected.Currently, the market is pretty uncertain.On March 7, one news event negatively affected the market with the S&amp;P 500 declining by 1.53% to below 4000. On March 7, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.""As a result, the peak level of interest rates could be higher than previously expected. If interest rates rise too much, the economy, while currently expanding, could slow or even contract.If the economy slows substantially enough, overall corporate earnings could decline. If earnings decline too much, there could be more of a headwind for the overall stock market.While the short term is uncertain, the odds are still good that in the long term many blue chip companies with substantial competitive advantages can generate fairly decent returns.Many blue chip companies are profitable and return excess capital through dividends. For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.Many blue chip companies that are profitable also buy back stock as another way of returning capital back to shareholders. If they buy back more stock than they issue and their earnings either stays the same or increases, the buybacks will help their EPS growth.Owning one blue chip is not a high probability way of benefiting from market growth in the long term however. Management of blue chips could make a bad acquisition for instance, or they might position their company incorrectly in an important field. As a result, the overall return of an individual blue chip might not do as well in the long term even though the company has numerous competitive advantages.Story continuesOne potential way to avoid that is to have a well diversified portfolio of leading blue chip stocks across many different sectors and holding for the long term.Energy, electricity, industryPhoto by Matthew Henry on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best Stocks Under $100, we selected 15 blue chip stocks with competitive advantages that had stock prices under $100 as of the close of March 7, 2023.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.15 Best Stocks Under $10015.

43,f51cb36c-3089-35bc-82b2-9aaf8dd95dd7,MS,2023-03-10,The Impact of Climate Change on Women and What Investors Can Do,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/impact-climate-change-women-investors-154500910.html,1678376700,STORY,"['MS', 'MS-PO', 'MS-PP']","[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 9, 2023 / Morgan Stanley:Originally published on Morgan Stanley InsightsClimate change and gender equity are both top-of-mind sustainability topics for investors. More than 80% of asset owners surveyed currently invest to combat climate change or plan to do so, while close to half are investing, or planning to, in gender diversity, according to the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing's latest Sustainable Signals report.But many investors may not realize that the issues of climate change and gender equity are highly interconnected. Investors looking to address climate issues holistically, including funding a ""just transition"" to a low-carbon economy that is fair, inclusive and has decent work opportunities for everyone, should assess and consider targeting solutions at the intersection of climate-related issues and gender equity.There are three specific areas in which interested investors can help tackle climate change and unlock opportunities for millions of women and girls worldwide:Water scarcity: In 2020, 1.7 billion people did not have a dedicated, safe water supply.1 This burden is worsening as climate change reduces the amount of available water due to drought, saltwater intrusion and the increasing runoff of pollutants and sediment.2 This has a disproportionate impact on women, who often carry the burden of collecting water for their households, taking them away from education or paid work.3Natural disasters: Women often take on additional caring responsibilities for those affected by natural disasters often catalyzed by a changing climate, increasing the time they spend on unpaid domestic labor.4 In addition, disruption following natural disasters is associated with higher rates of violence against women and girls. Examples include the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, after which there were reports of widespread rape and an increase in intimate partner violence.5Access to electricity: India illustrates one example of the obstacles that women and girls face when they don't have reliable access to electricity. Grid limitations in India have hampered the transition from coal toward renewable energy sources, and as a result, women and girls are burdened with the collection of solid fuels for heating, lighting and cooking, taking time away from other activities.6 Globally, two million women and children die prematurely each year from illnesses related to indoor air pollution, primarily from cooking with solid fuels.7Story continuesHow Investors Can Address Climate Change and Gender EquityBy assessing how their investments in climate-related issues might disproportionately affect at-risk female populations, investors have the potential to expand the breadth of their impact. One way for investors to do this is by considering what the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing calls ""Scope 3"" gender issues for companies, or the impact of a company's operations on women and girls around the world.For example, investments seeking to modernize grid infrastructure have a primary goal of enabling access to reliable and sustainable electricity to more people, while also reducing carbon emissions. But these investments also have the potential to reduce the time women and girls spend collecting solid fuels for the household, therefore providing more opportunities for paid work or education.Framing a Gender Company's FootprintUsing a carbon emissions analogy, Scope 1 gender issues are relatively easy to track, but Scope 2 and 3 affect many more women worldwide.*See chart aboveInvestors can use this framework above to map a company's footprint on gender issues, while also identifying opportunities to invest on issues at the intersection of climate and gender, especially in the ""Scope 3"" category. In addition, institutional investors and self-directed retail investors can follow these best practices to address both gender equity and climate change in their investment strategies:Seek investments explicitly targeting climate-related issues affecting women.Consider how existing investments in climate change or water solutions may affect women specifically.Screen for gender metrics alongside water- and carbon-intensity metrics, especially for investors following exclusionary investing approaches.Ask companies operating in highly water- and/or carbon-intensive industries to quantify, and then reduce, their operational impact on at-risk female communities.Include gender issues in proxy voting guidelines or cooperate with third parties to raise the issue of gender in climate-related investments.Incorporate gender and climate considerations into investment belief statements or fund prospectuses.Footnotes1Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, 2000 - 2020, WHO/Unicef joint monitoring programme.

Federal prosecutors called it the biggest corruption case in the state's history. The legislature revoked the bill in 2021.Following his arrest in 2020, the Ohio House of Representatives voted to remove Householder from the speakership position.Prosecutors had alleged that energy distributor FirstEnergy Corp gave $60 million to Generation Now, a political nonprofit operated by Householder. Those funds were used for lobbying that secured passage of the $1.5 billion bill in 2019, according to prosecutors.Householder and Borges were convicted of participating in the racketeering conspiracy, the Justice Department said in a statement on Thursday. The racketeering conspiracy as charged in this case is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.FirstEnergy agreed to pay $230 million in 2021 to settle U.S. government charges in the case. It admitted it paid millions of dollars to state officials to pursue legislation on nuclear subsidies and other policies that would benefit it.""Larry Householder illegally sold the statehouse, and thus he ultimately betrayed the great people of Ohio he was elected to serve,"" U.S. Attorney Kenneth Parker said on Thursday.

Each faces up to 20 years in prison.The government’s prosecution team was able to show that “Householder sold the Statehouse"" and betrayed the people he was elected to serve, and that Borges was “a willing co-conspirator,” U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Kenneth Parker said in a statement.“Through its verdict today, the jury reaffirmed that the illegal acts committed by both men will not be tolerated and that they should be held accountable,” Parker said.The man who brought the case, Parker's predecessor David DeVillers, tweeted: “The line between influence peddling and bribery will now be drawn by the rule of law and not by politicians, lobbyists and corporations.""“We are incredibly disappointed in the verdict,” Householder's attorney Steven Bradley said in an email. “We will take some time to evaluate all of our legal options and will most certainly pursue an appeal. Our client is looking forward to going home to be with his wife and family during this very difficult time.”The attorney representing Borges, 50, did not immediately respond to messages left by The Associated Press on Thursday. The verdict comes two-and-a-half years after Borges, Householder and three others were arrested.Prosecutors alleged that Householder, 63, orchestrated a scheme secretly funded by FirstEnergy Corp. to secure his power in the Legislature, elect his allies — and then to pass and defend legislation that delivered a $1 billion nuclear power plant bailout to the Akron-based electric utility. They alleged that Borges, then a lobbyist, sought to bribe Tyler Fehrman, an operative, for inside information on the referendum to overturn the bailout law.Story continues“Justice,” Fehrman, tweeted after the verdicts came down.In a phone interview, Fehrman said that the outcome proved the risk he took wearing a wire for the FBI as part of the government’s investigation was worth it.“For them to come back and find both of them guilty, and after not too long, is just such a relief,” he said. “It is a good day for Ohioans. This stuff just can’t continue to happen.”Householder had been one of Ohio’s most powerful politicians — an historically twice-elected speaker before his indictment. After his arrest, the Republican-controlled House ousted him from his leadership post, but he refused to resign for months on grounds he was innocent until proven guilty. In a bipartisan vote, representatives ultimately ousted him from the chamber, the first such expulsion in Ohio in 150 years.In a move that may have been pivotal in the trial's outcome, Householder took the stand in his own defense. Appearing confident and relaxed, he spent a day contradicting FBI testimony, defending his support for the bailout bill — known as House Bill 6 — and denying that he attended swanky Washington dinners where prosecutors alleged he and FirstEnergy executives hatched the scheme in 2017. But prosecutors eviscerated his claims on cross-examination the next day.Rachael Belz, CEO of the government watchdog group Ohio Citizen Action, said she hopes that the trial and guilty verdicts turn the tide in Ohio politics.“We don’t believe that utilities funneling millions of dollars through shell corporations to drive state policy is how our state government should work, nor do Ohio voters,” she said in a statement. Belz held the decision up as evidence that Ohioans expect and deserve better.“After so many years of utility-controlled energy policy that favored fossil fuels, Ohio must now move toward equitable, forward-looking solutions that will protect our air and water, the health of Ohioans, and provide clean energy jobs to keep Ohio competitive in the 21st-century economy,” Belz said.Borges did not testify at trial but has insisted that he’s innocent. His attorneys argued that he was entirely uninvolved with the pay-to-play scheme, while Householder's team portrayed his actions as nothing more than hardball politics.“The bottom line is that Larry Householder was engaged in political activity, not criminal activity,” his attorney Steven Bradley told jurors during closing statements. He said the government's investigation was flimsy and full of holes, calling it “a nothing burger.”But over the previous six weeks, jurors had been presented with firsthand accounts of the alleged scheme, as well as reams of financial documents, emails, texts and wire-tap audio.The prosecution called two of the people arrested — Juan Cespedes and Jeff Longstreth — to testify about political contributions that they said are not ordinary, but bribes intended to secure passage of the bailout legislation.Householder’s attorneys pushed back on arguments about their recollections, as well as their motivations. Both have pleaded guilty and are cooperating in hopes of a deal with the government.Jurors also heard taped phone calls in which Householder and another co-defendant, the late Statehouse superlobbyist Neil Clark, plotted a nasty attack ad — and, in expletive-laced fashion, contemplated revenge against lawmakers who had crossed Householder.Clark, who died by suicide in March 2021, was also heard describing to undercover FBI agents posing as developers how he was directing cash through Generation Now, a dark money group that has also pleaded guilty, to keep it secret.Householder testified that he never retaliated against those who voted counter to his wishes or who donated to his rivals. He told jurors that the set-up advanced his interests, which were the same as Ohio's interests, because they involved good policy.Under a deal to avoid prosecution, FirstEnergy admitted using a network of dark money groups to fund the bribery scheme and even bribing the state’s top utility regulator, Sam Randazzo.Randazzo resigned as chair of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio after an FBI search of his home, but he has not been charged and denies wrongdoing. The government has asked the PUCO to delay its own internal investigation into FirstEnergy while their probe continues.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Airbnb Inc. ABNB, salesforce.com inc. CRM, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW and Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Forget a Hawkish Fed: 5 Must-Buy Tech Stocks Flying High YTDU.S. stock investors are likely to face volatility for longer than expected as the Fed is set to pursue rigorous interest rate hike policies. On Mar 7 and 8, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before the U.S. Congress confirmed that any sort of relaxation in recent monetary tightness is a long way to go.The Fed was compelled to take an extremely hawkish stance as inflation remains sticky in the 5.5% to 6% range. Although it has declined from its peak 9.1% reported in June 2022, inflation is still miles above the central bank’s targeted 2% level.The CME FedWatch is showing that market participants are now expecting the terminal interest rate to reach the range of 5.5% to 5.75% instead of 5.1% projected in December. A section of economists and financial experts have warned that the United States is heading for 6% benchmark interest rate with a strong probability of a recession in 2023.Technology Sector Thrives Year to DateGrowth-oriented sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary are highly susceptible to interest rate movements. A high interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks. This is evident in the recent pandemic-induced turmoil.During the pandemic-ridden 2020 and 2021, the Fed kept the benchmark interest rate as low as 0-0.25%. Consequently, the tech sector witnessed an unprecedented rally that enabled Wall Street to exit a coronavirus-induced short bear market and form a new bull market.Story continuesHowever, as the Fed hiked interest rate by 4.5% in 2022 to combat the 40-year high inflation, the growth sectors, especially the technology stocks suffered the most. However, surprisingly, the tech sector is holding its ground year to date defying the threat of a higher rate hike for a longer time and its effect of a possible recession.Year to date, of the three major stock indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has advanced 10.6% while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 4% and the Dow has declined 1.1%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) — one of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index — has rallied 11.8% in 2023, second only to the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), which has appreciated 12.9%.Our Top PicksSeveral technology stocks have flourished year to date.

Continued recovery in both longer-distance and cross-border travel owing to a reduction in travel restrictions is benefiting ABNB’s Nights &amp; Experience bookings.

51,9f3f06aa-a477-3262-aaed-8a4e30b81413,CRM,2023-03-10,Bull of the Day: Salesforce (CRM),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-salesforce-crm-090009525.html,1678438809,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce (CRM) surged after the firm topped Q4 FY23 estimates on March 1 and provided upbeat guidance. The vanguard of modern business software assured activist investors and Wall Street on its earnings call and with its updated outlook that Salesforce is ready to focus on profitability over nearly everything else.Salesforce is poised to boost its margins and buybacks in the near term instead of chasing further acquisitions. CRM shares have surged over 35% YTD, yet they still hover near pre-pandemic levels from early 2020. Plus, Salesforce’s valuation has improved dramatically.Salesforce’s subscription-based offerings remain critical to around 150,000 companies in our digital-driven world. All told, it might be time to consider buying Salesforce stock as a long-term stable tech play.  Business EssentialsSalesforce helped start the software-as-a-service industry that nearly every business, government, and countless other entities rely on today to help them accomplish just about everything. Its various divisions support sales, marketing, commerce, communication, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond.   The company has grown its top line at an impressive clip since its 2004 IPO. CRM posted between roughly 25% and 35% sales growth for 10 straight years through its fiscal 2022—going from $3.1 billion in FY13 to $26.5 billion in FY22 (2021). Salesforce’s massive and steady expansion highlights the strength of its business model and the constant need for companies of all shapes and sizes to adapt to the quickly changing tech-fueled business landscape.Salesforce made a few large acquisitions over the last several years to expand its reach. These efforts include its $28 billion deal to buy Slack in the summer of 2021 to help CRM compete against Microsoft (MSFT) and Zoom Video (ZM) in the evolving work communication space. The deal came roughly two years after Salesforce paid $15 billion for data analytics platform Tableau.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRecent Performance &amp; New-Found Profitably FocusSalesforce’s fiscal 2023 (2022) revenue jumped 18% (22% in constant currency) to $31.4 billion to help boost its adjusted earnings by 10%. The firm’s adjusted operating margin popped from 18.7% in FY22 to 22.5% in FY23. The company also topped our Q4 FY23 estimates on March 1, with CRM beating the Zacks EPS estimates by 24%.Looking ahead, which is always far more important, CRM projects adjusted operating margins of about 27% in FY24. It was only last year that Salesforce executives laid out a plan to boost its adjusted operating margins to 25% by 2026. “Improving profitability is our highest priority, and that really showed up this quarter,” co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said on its recent earnings call.“Our goal is to make Salesforce the largest and most profitable software company in the world, and that is what we are doing.”The chief executive said the firm needed to “repress the hyperspace button” on its transformation plan for profitable growth. The accelerated transformation plan includes short-term and long-term restructuring, which includes reducing its workforce, lowering real-estate costs and spending, as well as improving profitability and productivity over the long haul.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforce also said it’s disbanding its M&amp;A committee. All of these pushes toward greater profitability come amid an activist investor push and slowing growth, which coincides with a slowing economy, its sheer size, and more. Salesforce is focused on a transformational FY24 that includes a beefed-up share repurchase plan from $10 billion to $20 billion.Salesforce provided upbeat top and bottom-line guidance for the current fiscal 2024. Current Zacks estimates call for its revenue to climb 10.5% this year to $34.6 billion and then another 11% in FY25 to $38.5 billion. Better yet, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb 33% and 26%, respectively during this same stretch. On top of that, CRM’s consensus FY24 and FY25 earnings estimates have surged since its recent release it to help it land Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Fundamentals Salesforce stock is up roughly 36% YTD to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 4% pop and the Zacks Tech sector’s 13% climb. CRM shares are now comfortably above its 50-day and 200-day moving average. Plus, the stock just experienced a so-called golden cross, which is when the shorter-term moving average crosses over a major long-term moving average.At roughly $180 per share, Salesforce stock trades 18% below its average Zacks price target and still sits around 40% beneath its 2021 peaks. The downturn, coupled with its hugely improved earnings outlook has Salesforce trading at 30.4X forward 12-month earnings. This marks a massive discount to its five-year highs of 206X and its five-year median of 120X. This time last year, CRM was trading at 90X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineA recent pullback has Salesforce stock back under overbought RSI levels (70 and above) at 61. And Wall Street is rather bullish on Salesforce, with 22 of the 37 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys,” alongside only one “Strong Sell.”Salesforce’s subscription software offerings aren’t going out of style anytime soon in our digital world. And the firm’s new-found focus on margins and profitability should attract long-term investors to this tech giant. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LULU has shown resilience backed by robust traffic trends in both stores and e-commerce, which have been boosting its comparable sales (comps) performance. The company is capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. It is also encouraged by the progress of its Power of Three x2 growth plan.Driven by these factors and continued business momentum, the company delivered its 10th straight quarter of earnings surprise and the third consecutive quarter of sales beat in third-quarter fiscal 2022. lululemon’s fiscal third-quarter earnings increased 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.The company’s adjusted earnings improved 28% on a three-year CAGR basis. Revenues advanced 28% year over year. Revenue growth was mainly driven by the strong momentum in its business, backed by a favorable response to its products.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 1.4% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 13.1%. The stock also compared favorably with the Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 15.9% and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 8%.An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for lululemon’s fiscal 2023 sales and EPS suggests growth of 28.5% and 26.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Driving Growthlululemon has been witnessing a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales, driven by an increase in store traffic, as consumers returned to stores for shopping. The company continues to remain focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. It is leveraging its stores to facilitate omni-channel capabilities, including the buy online pickup in store and ship-from-store.The company has implemented several strategies to improve the guest experience and reduce wait time. These include virtual waitlist, mobile POS and appointment shopping. These functionalities enable reducing the time of waiting in line to enter the store, as well as allow customers to complete some transactions like returns, exchanges and purchase of gift cards without entering the store.Additionally, lululemon expects to capture the growing online demand and ensure a robust shopping experience through its accelerated e-commerce investments. It has been investing in developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities. The company continues to strengthen omni-channel capabilities such as curbside pickups, same-day deliveries and BOPUS (buy online pick up in store).LULU is enhancing its mobile app in a bid to offer the curbside pickup facility and train its store associates to help customers speed up transactions. Free online digital educator service for people who cannot make it into lululemon stores also bodes well.The company is also on track with its Power of Three ×2 growth strategy. The move is likely to double its revenues from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion by 2026. The plan focuses on three key growth drivers, including product innovation, guest experience and market expansion.The five-year plan is likely to quadruple international sales, along with doubling digital and menswear sales. Also, the women’s business and North America operations are each anticipated to witness a low-double-digit CAGR in revenues, with store channel growth in the mid-teens in the next five years. As part of its strategy, the company intends to expand in China, as well as European markets, with plans to open stores in Spain and Italy.Driven by the robust trends, the company raised its revenue and earnings per share forecasts for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are likely to be in line with the prior forecast. lululemon anticipates net revenues of $2.660-$2.700 billion for fiscal 2022, suggesting year-over-year growth of 25-27%.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects adjusted earnings per share of $4.22-$4.27. It estimates an effective tax rate of 28.5% for the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continuesHeadwinds to Overcomelululemon continues to grapple with elevated costs, which has been hurting its gross margin. In its recent guidance update, the company sent warnings for soft fiscal fourth-quarter gross margin while it expected further SG&amp;A leverage. The company anticipates the gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter to contract 90-110 basis points (bps) compared with an increase of 10-20 bps mentioned earlier. However, it expects SG&amp;A expenses to leverage 100-120 bps versus the leverage of 30-50 bps mentioned earlier.Gross margin decline in fiscal 2022 is expected to result from higher investments in the distribution center network and more normalized markdowns from the low levels witnessed in the prior year.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Ralph Lauren RL, Crocs Inc.

Its search engine Bing here reaching a new milestone, reaching 100 million daily active users just weeks after rolling out its AI-powered Bing chat feature. So it looks to be paying off a little bit. Of its active users, the tech giant saying that roughly a third are new to Bing. In a blog post, though, Microsoft's head of consumer marketing writing that while they are gaining market share, Microsoft remains a small, low single digit share player.So let's put that all in perspective. Just how small? Yes, Bing now has 100 million daily active users. Google? More than a billion. And they've got-- so they've certainly got a lot of catching up to do. There is a lot of excitement around Bing, lots of excitement around Microsoft with ChatGPT, that partnership there putting them in the forefront of this AI race. When it comes to the search side of the business, though, far in the distance.JOSH SCHAFER: 100 to a billion, about 10 times bigger. So they're not going to take over Google in search, right? But I do wonder if there's a smaller market for AI related search. I mean, Google's been coming out and saying we had AI as part of our search for a while now. They've sort of been trying to get that out there. Hey, we've had AI here. But it seems like people are starting to think of Microsoft as maybe a potential leader in that space. If you're interested in it-- Dave, I've never even used any form of AI on Google before. I don't know if you have. I didn't really--DAVE BRIGGS: No, I have not.JOSH SCHAFER: I didn't really know that that was part of Google. I feel like I use Google like everyone else does. And so I don't know if people are going to now readjust to use Google with an AI focus or if Microsoft sort of just becomes the leader in that space. It seems like Microsoft might have an early headstart here.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Have you used ChatGPT?JOSH SCHAFER: No.DAVE BRIGGS: Really?JOSH SCHAFER: No.DAVE BRIGGS: You're the young kid here.JOSH SCHAFER: I know people have used it in the office, so I've looked at it to see how it works for our purposes here. But other than that, no, I don't really have an interest--DAVE BRIGGS: I was just curious. I have not yet used Bing.JOSH SCHAFER: --don't really have an interest in it.DAVE BRIGGS: Google says they're going to have more than 20 artificial intelligence products launching this year. So it's amazing when you start reading through earnings reports. Almost every CEO is leading with some form of AI and how they are either getting into that aspect or how they've always been in it. But now they're repositioning it. It's almost the investors have now required all these CEOs and CFOs to lead with that, even if it has nothing to do with their business, or if they've been in it for the last decade.]"

The deal will also include streaming and subscription parity to put future Call of Duty games on the PlayStation Plus subscription service on day one, just like its Game Pass.The offer is outlined in Microsoft’s response to the Competition and Markets Authority’s provisional findings on the deal, released last month.This follows Sony’s disapproval over Microsoft's earlier offer to keep the popular game series made by Activision Blizzard on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement expires.However, Sony Interactive Entertainment (""SIE"") has raised concerns about the potential for unsustainable licensing costs that could force the company to raise prices. After the Activision deal, Microsoft will get to choose the size of licensing fees for Sony to have Call of Duty on PlayStation Plus. Sony argues that the Xbox maker could make this fee too expensive.SIE alleges that this could result in Call of Duty becoming a Game Pass exclusive by default, dominating multi-game subscription services in the future.Microsoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteMicrosoft’s Deal With Other Tech Players to Convince SonyMicrosoft has been offering concessions in the form of multi-year deals involving Call of Duty to appease regulators’ concerns over its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition.It was reported earlier that the European Union will not be blocking this deal after the Xbox maker signed 10-year deals with Nintendo and Nvidia NVDA to bring Xbox and Activision games (including Call of Duty) on their respective services.Last month, Microsoft and NVDA announced that the companies have agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring Xbox PC games to the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service, which has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries.The agreement will enable gamers to stream Xbox PC titles from GeForce NOW to PCs, macOS, Chromebooks, smartphones and other devices. It will also enable Activision Blizzard PC titles, such as Call of Duty, to be streamed on GeForce NOW after Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision closes.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company struck a 10-year agreement with Nintendo under which Call of Duty will be available to Nintendo players on the same day as Xbox with full feature and content parity.

While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.P/B is the ratio of stock price to book value.It is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank, Signet Jewelers, EPR Properties and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our four picks out of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B.

Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. APi Group Corp., Signet Jewelers Ltd., Sterling Infrastructure and EPR Properties boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation.

Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results.

Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:APi Group is a market-leading business services provider of life safety, security and specialty services.

67,aac1c7bd-c72c-3d4c-be0e-ce11787a7464,SIG,2023-03-10,4 Stocks With Low P/B Ratio to Buy in March,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-low-p-b-121012410.html,1678363812,STORY,"['SIG', 'EPR', 'DBK.DE']","[When evaluating a company’s value, investors mostly look at a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio. While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.P/B is the ratio of stock price to book value.It is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank DB, Signet Jewelers SIG, EPR Properties EPR, and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our four picks out of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B.

This conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Paul Hughes, General Counsel for Orion. Please go ahead, Paul.Paul C. HughesThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, Orion released its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, filed its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission and posted its earnings supplement to its website. These documents are available in the Investors section of the company's website at www.onlreit.com. Forward-looking statements made during today's call such as the company's guidance for calendar year 2023, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our earnings release as well as in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements that may be made during today's call. Additionally, during the conference today, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations, or FFO, and core funds from operations, or core FFO. The company's earnings release and supplement include a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. As discussed in the company's earnings release and Form 10-K, we will be revising our definition of core FFO beginning in 2023 to exclude certain noncash amortization charges, which do not reflect the ongoing performance of our business.Hosting the call today are Paul McDowell, the company's Chief Executive Officer; Gavin Brandon, the company's Chief Financial Officer. And joining us for the Q&amp;A session are Gary Landriau, our Chief Investment Officer; and Chris Day, our Chief Operating Officer. With that, I am now going to turn the call over to Paul McDowell. Paul?Story continuesPaul H. McDowellThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Orion Office REIT's earnings call. On behalf of our team, I want to thank you all for joining us. On the call today, I will discuss our performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2022, touch on our first full year of operations and highlight the ongoing progress we are making on Orion's portfolio. I will then turn the call over to Gavin to provide an update on our financial results and guidance. As I mentioned, 2022 was our first full year of operations following our spin-off from Realty Income. During the year, we made significant progress in our core strategy that focuses on owning mission-critical suburban office properties located in high-quality suburban markets throughout the United States. These accomplishments came against the backdrop of an evolving and challenging economic environment for real estate in general and office properties in particular. Our mission, as we have communicated since inception is to own high-quality stabilized assets in the right markets and that will require, we resolve pending lease maturities and vacancies across a large portion of our portfolio in the coming years. To do so, we are intensively managing our assets, including making thoughtful capital allocation decisions in order to effectively address these issues. The ongoing economic environment of rising interest rates, persistent inflation, recession fears and many tenants in action on mandating a return to the office is impacting the timing around signing new and/or extending current leases in our properties. We have faced many of these headwinds since our spin. However, given the quality of our core assets, we have confidence that our approach to unlock long-term value from owning a large suburban net lease office portfolio in attractive markets will persevere with time. Many of us in Orion's senior management team have effectively navigated these cycles before. We believe that as conditions inevitably improve, the long-term demographic trends and the changing workplace to position our core properties to serve as the base to spur Orion's growth. As of year-end and including the disposition of 6 noncore properties in the fourth quarter, we owned 81 properties and 6 unconsolidated joint venture properties, representing 9.7 million square feet. That was 89% occupied, up slightly from 88.2% last quarter. It is important to stress the strengths that our core portfolio possesses. Our properties are leased to creditworthy tenants, primarily on a net lease basis. As a percentage of annualized base rent, there was 73.3% Investment Grade tenancy across the portfolio and approximately 83.4% of our leases are either triple or double net. Our portfolio's weighted average remaining lease term ended 2022 at 4.1 years, steady with 1 year ago. Our assets are also diversified by tenant, tenant industry and geography. No tenant industry makes up more than 13.4% of annualized base rent, and no single tenant makes up more than 11.9% of annualized base rent. Our largest markets by state are Texas and New Jersey, which represents 15% and 12% of annualized base rent, respectively. And approximately 33% of our annualized base rent is derived from Sunbelt markets, a proportion we intend to grow over time. From a leasing perspective, we look to begin renewal negotiations proactively with our existing tenants as early as we can. However, the uncertain economy and the continuing hesitancy to return to the office is resulting in the constant recalibration of businesses around the country as companies realign their expectations for space and growth. The consequence we have found is that our tenants continue to push leasing decisions out, are shrinking their space needs and new tenants are waiting to commit to new space. This dynamic is not unique to Orion nor our assets, but a symptom of the wider environment facing every office landlord. Importantly, we maintained leasing momentum throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we had 2, 10-year lease renewals for a total of 213,000 square feet at 2 of the company's properties in New York; 1, 5-year lease renewal for 90,000 square feet at one of the company's properties in Lawrence, Kansas; and 1, 5.4-year lease renewal for 4,000 square feet at one of the company's properties in The Woodlands in Houston, Texas. The company also signed a new 5.4-year lease for 78,000 square feet at one of its properties in Brownsville, Texas. For the year, we leased 805,000 square feet of space at positive cash rent spreads of more than 4% and with a weighted average lease term of more than 7 years. As we look back on our progress in only our first 14 months of being public, we have completed approximately 1.5 million square feet of lease renewals, expansions and new leases. As we look ahead, we continue to have an active pipeline of several hundred thousand square feet of leases in various stages of negotiation and documentation. Given the nature of our lease expirations, tenant retention will continue to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Specifically, we had 3 scheduled lease expirations during the fourth quarter, totaling about 286,000 square feet, and we own 5 vacant assets at year-end. 2023 will present a variety of challenges for retention, particularly given that we have more than 750,000 square feet of space expiring in suburban Chicago, including the Walgreens campus. That said, we focus intently on addressing vacancy in the portfolio on commercially reasonable terms in regards to the timing and expense. At year end, our vacant space represented about 11% or 1.1 million square feet of the overall portfolio, and we incur annual operating expenses of roughly $7.50 per square foot on average to keep that space. Accordingly, one of our main asset management strategies has been to sell vacant and identify noncore assets that do not fit our long-term investment objectives to both reduce carry costs and avoid the uncertainty and significant capital expenditures associated with retenanting. In 2022, we deliberately focused our resources on this strategy and closed on 11 sales of approximately 900,000 square feet for approximately $33 million. This equated to a price per square foot of about $36, both reducing existing vacancy and avoiding near-term vacancy as the leases expire. 8 of the 11 properties were vacant as of the date of sale and the remaining 3 had near-term lease expirations where we knew the tenants were not renewing. We estimated the sale of these 11 assets will allow us to save annual vacant property carrying costs of about $7.5 million. If the 2 properties we sold in Illinois at auction in the fourth quarter excluded, our average sales price per square foot for the year was about $50, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year. For the year, we disposed of over 400,000 square feet in Illinois, a decidedly slow growth, high tax state with accompanying poor suburban office fundamentals. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell our 574,000 square foot six property corporate Walgreens campus in Illinois, where the Walgreens leases will expire in August 2023, and the tenant will not be renewing. The sale is scheduled to close in early 2024 and is subject to completion of the buyer's entitlement process. We have determined to sell these properties given the upcoming vacancy, high carry costs and our focus on locating our portfolio in the right markets. To that point, all of our sales have moved closer -- the portfolio closer to our long-term targets. Including the Walgreens campus, we have 7 properties totaling about 584,000 square feet currently under contract for sale an aggregate sale price of approximately $36.6 million or $63 per square foot. We are also actively marketing a number of other assets for sale totaling over 500,000 square feet that are currently vacant and/or have short-term leases where we know the tenant will not renew. We believe selling these assets is the right decision for the long-term value we are looking to create. During 2022, we took a very deliberate approach to our balance sheet. Rather than quickly grow the portfolio with debt-funded acquisitions in a market where values were changing rapidly as rates rose, we focused on selling vacant and noncore assets to reduce carry cost and use the proceeds to pay down debt. Our current debt is largely hedged at attractive rates. We have no borrowings on our revolver and overall net debt to gross real estate investments is a conservative 31%. In 2022, we made tremendous progress on our business plan. Our proactive asset management and disposition activities, along with good leasing momentum, moved our portfolio meaningfully in the right long-term direction. We finished our first full year as a public company with a portfolio of producing positive net cash flow and our available capital to execute our business plan is more than sufficient. Our financial capacity, the underlying strength of many of the properties we own in the portfolio, along with our proven ability over the past 30 years operating this asset class provides us with the confidence that Orion will emerge as a net lease office for us in the coming years. With that, I will now turn the call over to Gavin.Gavin B. BrandonThanks, Paul. I will begin by discussing Orion's GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2022 and highlight some key metrics for the full year. Orion generated total revenues for the quarter of $50.3 million and reported net loss attributable to common stockholders of $19 million or a loss of $0.33 per share. Core funds from operations was $23.2 million or $0.41 per share, and adjusted EBITDA was $30.7 million. For the full year, Orion's total revenues were $208.1 million and a net loss attributable to common stockholders was $97.5 million or a loss of $1.72 per share. Core funds from operations was $101.8 million or $1.80 per share and exceeded the high end of the company's 2022 guidance by $0.02 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $132.2 million. G&amp;A in the fourth quarter was $4.4 million, while CapEx, tenant and property improvements and leasing costs were $6.1 million. As our leases roll and given the uncertain timing of when leases are signed and when work is completed on our properties, as we have discussed, CapEx timing will vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We do expect to incur meaningfully more CapEx in 2023 than we did in 2022, tenants begin to draw on previously agreed on tenant improvement allowances. G&amp;A for the full year was $15.9 million, which is slightly below the company's 2022 guidance range for G&amp;A expenses of $16 million to $16.5 million, and CapEx and tenant improvements and leasing costs were $14.6 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $557.3 million of outstanding debt, including Orion's proportionate share in the joint venture. During the fourth quarter, we utilized a combination of proceeds from asset dispositions and cash flows from operations to repay $31 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings on our $425 million revolving credit facility. It is worth noting that in our first 14 months of operations, we have reduced debt by approximately $90 million or 15%. At year-end, we had total liquidity of $446.2 million, consisting of $425 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility and $21.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, including Orion's proportionate share in the Arch Street joint venture. 100% of our currently outstanding debt is fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.06x for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is 0.64x lower than the company's guidance of 4.7x to 5.0x. Our $175 million credit on facility is scheduled to mature in November 2023 and the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in November 2024. We expect to extend, repay or refinance these facilities on or prior to maturity. Our focus has been running the enterprise this past year on a low leverage basis, while limiting our need to use our revolving credit facility which gives us good flexibility to execute on our business plan moving forward. Now turning to our dividend. The Orion Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be paid on April 17, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2023. With our current liquidity anticipated proceeds from dispositions and the cash the business is generating itself, we believe we are in a strong financial position to achieve our near and longer-term objectives. Partially to maintain maximum liquidity in the current environment, the company did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter through its previously announced $50 million open market repurchase program. Turning to the outlook of 2023. We again want to highlight we have added disclosure regarding revisions to our core FFO definition beginning in 2023. The new definition will exclude certain noncash amortization charges which do not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our business. We produced strong core FFO in 2022 of $1.80 per diluted share. As we have stated in the past, we benefited in 2022 from a number of items that will not carry forward. In the next 2 years, our financial results will be impacted by a large number of lease expirations. This will result in a reduction in revenue quarter-to-quarter due to the smaller portfolio size and be further impacted by vacancy carry costs and the time to release as well as the required investment to secure longer-term leases. G&amp;A will also rise in 2023 as compared to 2022 as subsidies provided by Realty Income at the spin-off expire. We amortized an additional year of noncash compensation and our public company costs will increase. Given those assumptions, our core FFO for 2023 is expected to range from $1.55 to $1.63 per diluted share. Additionally, our G&amp;A for 2023 is anticipated to range from a $18.75 million to $19.75 million and net debt to adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from 4.3x to 5.3x. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Mitch Germain from JMP Securities.Mitchell Bradley GermainSo how should I think about the trajectory of G&amp;A, obviously, as you continue to sell assets and the portfolio size shrinks? I guess, for at least a temporary period of time, how should I think about G&amp;A on a forward basis? .Gavin B. BrandonYes. Mitch, this is Gavin. So G&amp;A -- we're essentially normalized in terms of staffing. As we look to sell properties that are vacant, we always will challenge our G&amp;A structure. As far as next year goes, we're going to have another additional year of stock-based compensation. So 2023 will be normalized with an exception of a 2024, 1-year more tranche of G&amp;A impact by that stock-based compensation.Paul H. McDowellRight. So the large increase in G&amp;A between last year and this year, Mitch, is a function of the subsidies going away from Realty Income, we don't expect to be increasing G&amp;A materially beyond what Gavin just mentioned in the coming years.Mitchell Bradley GermainGot you. Okay. That's helpful. I think you mentioned an auction sale. Is that something that drove down pricing? Is that -- did I hear that correctly?Paul H. McDowellYes. I mean in the -- we've sold properties through a variety of channels during the course of 2022, both directly to end users or to investors, and we've also sold a number of properties through the auction process, which is very efficient and gets the properties done quickly, but may have an impact on pricing. .Mitchell Bradley GermainUnderstood. How much of the 500,000 square feet that is queued up for sale, how much of that is being sold a more traditional way or how much of that is now being sold through the auction process?Paul H. McDowellI think we're looking at that now. Most of it is being sold through the traditional process at the moment. However, if we don't get it done in the traditional process, we may turn to the auction process. .Mitchell Bradley GermainGot you. Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, is there any -- I mean, how should we think about the ability to refi that tranche of debt later this year? I mean where is the market for that these days? I'm curious in terms of kind of some guidance of how we should consider that tranche of debt?Paul H. McDowellSo -- yes, it's a good question, Mitch. We're obviously in pretty continuous discussions with our banks. Wells Fargo is our lead manager, and that's a group of folks we've worked with for a long time. We have full capacity on our revolving credit facility. So we have more than enough. We have the ability to pay off the term loan with utilization of the revolver, if necessary. And indeed, that's one of the reasons why we've been so careful with the balance sheet in the past year by reducing debt and by lowering our overall leverage and by having as much capacity as we possibly can so that when we come to either refinancing or paying down the term loan, we have more than enough capacity to do so.OperatorOur next question is coming from Gaurav Mehta from EF Hutton.Gaurav MehtaI wanted to ask you on your 2023 guidance. I was wondering if you could provide any color on what you are underwriting for occupancy and rental rate spreads during the year?Paul H. McDowellSure, Gaurav. Nice to talk with you this morning. I think we're -- we expect occupancy to remain relatively stable during the course of the year, potentially with some decline as we have some leases that we discussed earlier, expiring, for example, in August, we have the Walgreens leases expiring, which is 574,000 square feet. So that obviously will have a negative impact on occupancy. Positive impacts to occupancy would be our sale of vacant properties. So to the extent that we have to hold Walgreens' vacant through the end of the year before it sells in the beginning of next year, we'll have a temporary dip in occupancy towards the end of the year.Gaurav MehtaOkay. You also talked about marketing additional 500,000 square feet of properties. Are you expecting any sales this year or your expectation is that majority of the sales would be next year?Paul H. McDowellNo, no. We expect to have a relatively significant number of sales this year. And then next year, the big sale candidate would be the Walgreens and we've discussed and we hope we'll sell in the very beginning of 2024. But in 2023, we have a number of properties currently in the market, and we expect to sell a relatively significant number of those during the course of the year.OperatorWe reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Paul for any further closing comments.Paul H. McDowellThank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to updating everyone with our first quarter call in May. Thank you.OperatorThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.]"

That's after the company decided not to dispense an abortion drug in states where Republican officials are threatening legal action. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Anjalee Khemlani joins us with more on this story. So Anjalee, what is California-- why is California taking this stance?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, Rochelle, California took this stance, and what it does is actually end a contract that was set to expire on May 1 in which Walgreens dispenses prescriptions to inmates in California. And so that's what Governor Newsom has ended. He has also threatened to find other areas where the company and the state interact and see what can be done there. Now, what's at stake here is really the future of the abortion pill dispensing across the country, especially after the FDA opened up the ability for mail order back in January. And so what's happening right now is a direct result of that, the governor taking the stance after 21 attorneys general sent letters to Walgreens asking them or threatening them with legal action if they dispensed in the state, citing different legal reasons, and Walgreens saying, well, we agree we're not going to, you know, dispense in these states right now. So that's sort of the basic play by play right now of what has happened and what has led to this specific response from California.- I mean, sometimes, we do see states on the opposing side of what some corporations want to do. But why has the situation escalated to this level?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, what's happening is actually very complicated and nuanced, very legal, and also political. So, what these AGs did was cite old laws like mail laws, federal laws that have to do with the use of mail, and specifically for the use of anything related to abortion. They said in their letter that they, quote, reject the Biden administration's bizarre interpretation of then allowing the FDA to open things up, which was a result of the FDA relaxing the rules during the pandemic.Story continuesThat's where this first all started. They've also cited state laws prohibiting. And what has been true is that of the 20 or so states, abortion is legal in a handful of them, and there are specific laws that are kind of nuanced when it comes to whether or not the pill is legal but can be used through mail order, can be delivered through mail order, because many of these states tend to have pretty restrictive rules, including having to have an ultrasound, for example, before a patient is allowed to use the pill or having to have some sort of consultation or a physician nearby when using the pill.So it does kind of shift the landscape, if you will, when it comes to what actually can be done, whether or not these pharmacies can play in these markets. Florida, for example, already does not allow pharmacies to dispense the pill. There are other states among those that signed on where abortion is legal-- Iowa, for example, where, yes, it's available now.Legislation has already been introduced to ban the pill, but that's on hold as the governor wants to ban abortion past six weeks. That's the stance that Texas initially held before it fully banned abortion. And six weeks is said to be a pretty restrictive timeline, not allowing for really a lot of room for any action to be taken. So you're seeing it all together in there.Now, Walgreens response, we know the part where they agreed not to dispense has been widely reported, but what hasn't been focused on is the sentence following, and it's kind of important because it gives them sort of a CYI where they say if the situation changes, they will notify these AGs. So they really left it open and on the table for a shift in policy. If you want, if you can see on your screen, this is part of their letter in response. So, all told it's very complicated very nuanced, and, like I've said before, very much a developing story as we wait for the FDA to decide to certify and how it's going to certify mail order for these pills.- Indeed, very interesting take on some of the language there. As you mentioned, they're leaving the door open. So we'll definitely be keeping an eye on this story. Thank you for that breakdown. Anjalee Khemlani there for us.]"

Why the drug’s future is in doubt and how it got Walgreens into hot water,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mifepristone-used-medication-abortion-decades-125907244.html,1678366747.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Grandmas are propping up the economy, Patagonia has acquired a female-founded sustainable snack company, and we explain why mifepristone is all over the headlines. Happy Thursday! - The mifepristone mess. In recent days, you’ve likely heard mifepristone mentioned in the news and in The Broadsheet. The drug—one of two normally prescribed for medication abortion—is used for more than half of all abortions in the U.S., including in states that have drastically restricted access to in-person abortion procedures. Now, two parallel storylines related to the pill are capturing headlines. Let's break them both down:First, a federal judge is poised to rule on a lawsuit that could block the distribution of the drug. Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Texas-based Trump appointee, will decide a lawsuit brought by an anti-abortion organization called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine. The group is seeking an injunction preventing the distribution of mifepristone, which was approved for nationwide distribution by the Food and Drug Administration two decades ago.For weeks now, a ruling has been expected. Kacsmaryk has a record as a strong opponent of abortion. His ruling, while likely to pull mifepristone from the market, would be temporary as the case winds its way through the legal system.Which brings us to the story of the week: Walgreens.The pharmacy said last week that it would not distribute medication abortion in states where attorneys general have threatened legal action. That’s 21 Republican-controlled states where the chain would not distribute the drug, including states where abortion remains legal.The announcement comes as major pharmacies figure out how to deal with a January FDA decision to allow pharmacies to dispense the drug in person and by mail with FDA certification. Before, only certified health care providers could prescribe and dispense the drug.Walgreens’ announcement ignited a furor among supporters of abortion rights, who vowed to boycott the chain.California was the first blue state to respond, with Gov. Gavin Newsom declaring that the state “won’t be doing business” with Walgreens. “All relationships between Walgreens and the state” were under review, he said. Yesterday, he said California will not renew Walgreens' $54 million contract to fulfill inmates' prescriptions.Walgreens later attempted to walk back its statement, saying that it “plans to dispense mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it is legally permissible to do so.”For followers of notable women business leaders, this story has another layer: The CEO of Walgreens is Roz Brewer, one of two Black female CEOs in the Fortune 500 and a much-admired former Starbucks and Sam’s Club executive. Brewer has yet to comment directly on the matter. Another woman-led major pharmacy chain—CVS Health, led by CEO Karen Lynch—has yet to comment at all on its plans; it also received GOP legal threats.Story continuesAs the episode plays out, it may prove that on these thorny business and political issues, in which state laws have—to some degree—tied the hands of corporations, CEO leadership only goes so far.Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

Here is what the firm has to say:“”We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Others sell goods that are priced in dollars such as Parker-Hannifin’s (NYSE:PH) aerospace products. Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend Growth.  Suggested articles:14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now10 Mad Money Stock Picks This Week11 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for BeginnersDisclosure.

80,16de74ae-accc-37e0-aa63-a803f9e33ef3,SYY,2023-03-10,12 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-small-cap-stocks-insider-200008015.html,1678392008,STORY,"['DSEY', 'KYMR', 'MTX', 'JBGS', 'CRTO', 'TBBK', 'ESTE', 'OXY', 'ADI', 'SYY']","[In this article, we discuss 12 small-cap stocks with insider buying. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying. Insider buying refers to a company's officers, directors, or major shareholders purchasing shares of their own company's stock. Insider purchases can send a positive signal to the market that insiders believe the company's stock is undervalued and has potential for future growth. They also align the interests of the company's management and shareholders. Insider buying can increase transparency and accountability by providing information about the company's financial health and growth potential. This information can help investors make more informed decisions about whether to invest in the company's stock.According to a report from Argus Research in June 2022, corporate insiders seemed to recognize the value of their stocks, as per high trading activity at the time. Vickers Stock Research data was cited by Argus, which noted that insiders purchased shares of their respective companies in large numbers during June’s significant stock market decline. The report stated that the data indicates that corporate insiders were either buying their own company's stock at the same frequency as they were selling it, or they were buying more than they were selling. This surge in insider buying resulted in a sell-to-buy ratio of almost 1.0 in the eight-week period, which the report described as a ""very healthy"" level. Typically, insiders tend to sell their shares 2-2.5 times more frequently than they purchase them. Argus further explained:""While there are many reasons to think stocks could fall further, current insider sentiment is not one of them. Insiders apparently see across-the-board value in stocks as they are ‘keeping the faith.’”Investors should pay attention to the positive signal sent by corporate insiders, especially in light of the current economic climate. With inflation at a 40-year high, interest rates increasing rapidly, and the possibility of a recession looming, insider buying can provide reassurance to investors about the potential health and stability of their investments. Some of the companies which experienced significant insider buying in 2022 include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), and Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). However, in this article, we discuss the top small-cap stocks with insider buying. Story continuesOur Methodology We used a stock screener to filter for small-cap stocks, which have market caps between $300 million to $2 billion. Then we filtered for companies with insider transactions of more than 20%. This metric represents six-month percentage change in total insider ownership. The resultant dataset was ranked according to market cap in the descending order, and we selected the top small-cap firms with insider purchases during 2022 onwards. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider BuyingPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashSmall-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying12.

81,9103c7de-bcd0-30db-9eda-fc5bcefbdeaf,SYY,2023-03-10,7 Dividend Kings to Buy for an Uncertain Market Environment,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-kings-buy-uncertain-215135011.html,1678139495,STORY,"['ABBV', 'JNJ', 'NWN', 'PG', 'KO', 'SYY', 'ABT', 'CL']","[Though the term dividend aristocrats generate plenty of interest for the underlying elite status, another even more rarefied category exists called dividend kings to buy. Rather than 25 years of consecutive payout growth, the kings command at least 50 years. As we head into uncertain times, investors should pay close attention to this rare group of enterprises.Fundamentally, of course, companies that can afford to provide passive income to their stakeholders tend to be deeply established businesses. Should unexpected turbulence hit the market, they’re likelier to ride out the turmoil compared to growth-centric organizations. Therefore, dividend kings to buy deserve serious consideration for your portfolio. In addition, these elites of elite firms will want to keep the trend going at any cost. Naturally, you don’t want to be the person responsible for a 50-plus-year track record being broken. Thus, you’re in reasonably good hands with these dividend kings to buy.ABBVAbbVie$155.28CLColgate-Palmolive$73.29PGProcter &amp; Gamble$140.35NWNNorthwest Natural$47.41KOCoca-Cola$60.36SYYSYSCO$76.35JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$155.56InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAbbVie (ABBV)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comA top-flight pharmaceutical firm, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) ranks among the most intriguing dividend kings to buy. According to Dividend.com, the company features 51 years of consecutive payout growth. Now, it’s worth pointing out for clarification that AbbVie spun off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2012. Therefore, Dividend.com tracks the history to Abbott, not to the 2012 spinoff date.Now, either way, I don’t think you can go wrong. For Abbott, the company might be undervalued relative to forward earnings. In AbbVie’s case, it too may be undervalued. For instance, the market prices ABBV at a forward multiple of 13.66. As a discount to earnings, AbbVie ranks better than 60.16% of the competition.Story continuesFundamentally, AbbVie’s buyout of Allergan – the manufacturer of Botox – could pay off handsomely. As people return to the office, a greater incentive exists to look presentable. That should help Botox and in turn ABBV stock. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ABBV as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $163.64, implying 6% upside potential.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comOne of the top manufacturers of household goods, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) commands attention for the underlying toothpaste. According to Divdend.com, the enterprise features 60 years of consecutive dividend growth. Further, it carries a forward yield of 2.57%. In contrast, the underlying consumer staples sector’s average yield sits at 1.89%. Finally, its payout ratio is 55.23, reflecting a reasonably sustainable passive income.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), CL rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, Colgate-Palmolive’s greatest strengths lie in its profitability metrics. Perhaps most notably, its operating margin stands at 19.77%, outpacing 90.77% of the field. As well, its net margin pings at 9.93%, above nearly 80% of the industry.Further, while it could use a little bit of improvement in the balance sheet, Colgate-Palmolive’s Altman Z-Score is 6.43. This indicates a very low risk of bankruptcy over the next two years. Lastly, covering analysts peg CL as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target is $79.70, implying 8% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the steady dividend kings to buy.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWith so many rumblings in the market and in the broader global economy, consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) simply makes sense. However, the enterprise’s status as one of the dividend kings to buy makes PG all the more attractive. Presently, Procter &amp; Gamble commands 67 years of consecutive payout growth. As well, its forward yield stands at 2.61%. Again, this ranks conspicuously higher than the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%.According to Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations, PG rates as fairly valued. Objectively, it might be a tough overvalued. However, this is really an organization built for the long haul. For instance, the consumer goods stalwart features an Altman Z-Score of 5.06, implying low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, PG enjoys a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 31.2%, outpacing 82% of the field. However, it’s again the profitability that drives the case for PG as one of the dividend kings to buy. Its net margin stands at 17.79%, above nearly 92% of the industry.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target is $157.48, implying almost 13% upside potential.Northwest Natural (NWN)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Portland, Oregon, Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN) provides natural gas service to approximately 2.5 million people in Oregon and southwest Washington. As a public utility, Northwest enjoys a natural monopoly. Because of the scale involved and the high barrier to entry, it’s doubtful that anyone can usurp Northwest.Cynically, then, NWN makes for an enticing opportunity among dividend kings to buy. Currently, the utility commands 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, its forward yield stands at 4.06%. In contrast, the utility sector’s average yield is 3.75%. Now, one factor to keep in mind is that Northwest’s payout ratio of just under 70% is a bit high. Still, no one’s going to want to give up the dividend king status. Also, for full transparency, Northwest doesn’t offer wow-factor financials. However, Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations rate NWN as modestly undervalued.Finally, covering analysts peg NWN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $54.33, implying almost 14% upside potential.Coca-Cola (KO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comProbably the world’s most famous soft-drink manufacturer, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) needs no introduction. Not only does it represent a blue-chip giant, it effectively symbolizes American capitalism. From this angle, it’s not terribly surprising that KO ranks among the dividend kings to buy.Right now, the iconic enterprise features 62 years of consecutive payout growth. As well, the company’s fairly generous with its passive income, carrying a forward yield of 3.08%. Again, in contrast, the consumer staples sector’s average yield is 1.89%. While I wouldn’t fret about the sustainability of the yield, prospective investors should note the payout ratio of 65.82%.At the present juncture, Gurufocus.com rates KO as fairly valued. However, patient investors may be able to advantage of Coca-Cola’s operational strengths. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 4.6% while its net margin hit 22.19%. Both stats rate into the top tier of the underlying industry. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg KO as a consensus strong buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $68.33, implying over 14% upside potential.SYSCO (SYY)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, SYSCO (NYSE:SYY) specializes in marketing and distributing food products, small wares, kitchen equipment, and tabletop items to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, and hospitality businesses. Given its vast relevancies, it makes for an attractive idea among dividend kings to buy. Specifically, Sysco commands 54 years of consecutive dividend increases.In addition, it offers a forward yield of 2.59%. I’m not going to repeat it but it’s higher than the underlying consumer staples sector. Also, it should be stated that the payout ratio sits at 42.68%. While it’s not the lowest figure in the world, no one should worry excessively about yield sustainability. Gurufocus.com rates SYY as modestly undervalued. Objectively, Sysco’s greatest strengths lie in its profitability-related metrics. For instance, its return on asset (ROA) pings at 6.45%, outpacing 77% of the competition.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SYY as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $88.15, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA consumer goods and healthcare giant, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) represents one of the world’s most recognizable brands. As well, with so many events seemingly spiraling out of control globally, JNJ just seems like a smart bet overall. Tack on the fact that it’s one of the dividend kings to buy and you have a very compelling bullish case.At the moment, Johnson &amp; Johnson features 61 years of consecutive payout growth. In addition, the company carries a forward yield of 2.91%. In contrast, the healthcare sector’s average yield sits at 1.58%. Also noteworthy is the payout ratio, which pings at 41.5%. At this rate, investors can sleep a little easier when it comes to yield sustainability. Financially, the company’s greatest strengths lie in its profitability metrics.

(NASDAQ:MNST) recently surpassed the $100 mark. While directors on the board no doubt cheered the occasion, it also prompted them to split the companys shares.On March 28, shares will undergo a two-for-one split, and all investors will suddenly find themselves with the double the number of shares they owned the night before.Not that it will make them any richer because the share price will also split in half. For example, if the price at the close of trading on March 27 is $110, then the price on March 28 will be $55.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MNST. Click here to check it out. MNST 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MNSTPeter Lynch Chart of MNSTHowever, it is possible the shares could end up being worth more, but certainly not guaranteed. To understand this dynamic in pricing, we need to reflect on why the board decided to split the shares in the first place.While the energy drink developer and distributor may have some unique reason it is keeping to itself, the most likely goal is to increase liquidity. For those who are unfamiliar with the term, liquidity refers to the speed or ease with which an asset can be traded or turned into cash.In this case, it is quicker and easier to trade $50 shares than $100 shares. Among investors who buy in lots of 100 shares, more can afford $5,000 than $10,000. Institutional investors, who trade in lots of hundreds of thousands of shares, might also appreciate a lower entry point.Whatever the case, the board likely believes the lower price will lead to higher liquidity. And higher liquidity usually means greater demand and, in turn, greater demand should push up the price.Over the past dozen years, Monster has split its shares twice: on Feb. 16, 2012 and Nov. 10, 2016. In both cases, the share price went up, but it could also be argued the shares were already in an uptrend. The following 15-year chart shows the previous split dates with vertical black lines (given the time period of the chart, the lines could not be placed on the exact dates, but are within a couple of days of them).Story continuesA Monster Beverage Stock Split Is Coming SoonSo there may be a short-term opportunity for traders, but that overlooks the greater opportunity for long-term investors.While we have the chart still in mind, note how long-term investors have harvested steady capital gains over the past decade. The stock has been somewhat volatile at times, but keeps on rising on any multiyear basis.Over the past decade, the price rose from $15.70 on March 8, 2013 to $103.50 today (March 9, 2023), what Peter Lynch might call a 6.6 bagger.This graphic representation of the income statement shows its sources of income and the wide band showing net income illustrates how it earned a profit of almost 19% last year:A Monster Beverage Stock Split Is Coming SoonOver the past 10 years, its net margin has ranged from a low of 15.08% to a high of 30.65%, with a median of 23.87%. It currently sits at 18.88%.GuruFocus reports that its net margin is better than 91.07% of the 108 companies in the non-alcoholic beverages industry.Given the margin and the fact it does not pay a dividend, Monster has significant amounts of free cash flow to keep growing the business. That takes place through both organic growth and acquisitions. Here is a screenshot from the 10-K for 2022, showing a list of new products introduced last year alone:A Monster Beverage Stock Split Is Coming SoonThe company added:Our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.It also pulled a few underperforming products, but they will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.As for its fundamentals overall, Monster receives a very high 95 out of 100 GF Score.A Monster Beverage Stock Split Is Coming SoonMore specifically, it receives 10 out of 10 scores for financial strength, profitability and growth, while receiving a 6 out of 10 for valuation and momentum.The GF Value Line gives it an intrinsic value of $109.56, which is just $6 more than the current price, and a fairly valued verdict based on historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections.A Monster Beverage Stock Split Is Coming SoonIts price-earnings ratio is among the highest in the industry at 46.26, while its PEG ratio is 5.03, well above fair valuation by that measure.Part of the reason the PEG ratio is so high is because of the high price-earnings number, and the other part reflects the slump in Ebitda in 2022 (one year in the five that go into the Ebitda average):A Monster Beverage Stock Split Is Coming SoonOver the past two years, free cash flow has also taken a dive. The company explained, Principal uses of cash flows in 2022 were purchases of investments, purchases of treasury stock, the acquisition of CANarchy, development of our brands internationally and acquisitions of real property, property and equipment.Except for stock repurchases, Monster used its cash flow to reinvest in its business.Seven gurus held positions at the end of 2022, according to 13F filings. The biggest stake, by far, was that of Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies (3,005,417 shares). The second and third largest positions were those of Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio)'s Bridgewater Associates (924,733 shares) and Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)'s Point72 Asset Management (543,029 shares).Institutional investors held 58.25%, while insiders owned 0.48%.Investors should be aware that 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firms holdings as the reports only include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.In summary, the stock split gets the headline, but long-term investors will appreciate Monster Beverages robust fundamentals and its profitable growth. There may be no dividend, but the steady stream of capital gains over the past decade and more suggests a bright future.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Here Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Be Adding To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-host-hotels-properties-204758112.html,1678394878,STORY,"['HST', 'MAR', 'AC.PA']","[When an investor decides to buy a real estate investment trust (REIT), they are buying both that real estate company and the large block of tenants or brands occupying the REIT’s portfolio.Before you decide to buy a REIT, it pays to consider the history and solvency of its largest tenants. Ask yourself these questions: Are there any tenants who are facing bankruptcy or reducing their size? Are the tenants of high-grade quality? Are the tenants diversified, not only geographically, but also by each tenant accounting for a small percentage of the total tenant portfolio?Take a look at one well-known hotel REIT, and consider the questions raised above in evaluating its merits:Check out the latest private market real estate offering announcements from Benzinga:Missoula Marriott Portfolio - Two Marriott Hotels With A Target IRR Of 15.2%Port 99 Industrial Park - Industrial Park Development With A 22.5% Target IRRHost Hotels and Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel REIT that calls itself “the world’s largest lodging REIT.” It’s an S&amp;P 500 company that owns and operates 42,214 rooms in 78 hotels, including 20 of the largest markets across the U.S. and another five hotels in Canada and Brazil. It was formed in 1993 and has a market capitalization of $12.63 billion.Most of Host Hotels’ properties are upscale and luxury hotels in central business districts that are located near airports. These hotels generally include amenities such as restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and gift shops. Of its 78 hotels, 28 contain more than 500 rooms. The U.S. locations are below:host hotels property mapThe average age of Host Hotels and Resorts properties is 35 years. The geographic diversity of Host Hotels and Resorts’ properties, as shown above, is an advantage, especially if certain areas hold up better than others during a recession.Host Hotels and Resorts’ portfolio includes several well-known names. Its tenant brands are:Story continuesBRANDNUMBER OF HOTELSROOMSPERCENTAGE OF REVENUESMARRIOTT5129,30260.4HYATT138,30521.0ACCOR HOTELS415173.4HILTON412692.9OTHERS/INDEPENDENTS6182111.6Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) is also based in Bethesda and owns and operates Marriott hotels, along with names such as The Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Westin, Four Points, St. Regis and others. The Marriott company was founded in 1927, and its hotels have been around since the 1950s. Today it includes 30 sub-brands and 8,000 properties across 139 countries.Marriott International has a $53.55 billion market cap and a dividend yield of 0.92%.Hyatt Hotels Corp. (NYSE: H), also known as Hyatt Hotels &amp; Resorts, is a Chicago-based company that began in 1957 and grew to include international hotels and resorts by 1969. It owns 26 distinct brands in over 1,100 hotels around the world. The majority of its brands are upscale and luxury hotels.Accor S.A. (AC.PA) is a multinational company based in France that owns, manages and franchises hotels, resorts and vacation properties. Accor was founded in 1967 and is now the largest hospitality company in Europe and the sixth-largest hospitality company in the world. It has 5,300 locations in 110 countries. Accor and Marriott are the two largest hotel companies in the Middle East.Accor owns several brands of its own, including Banyan Tree, Sofitel Legend, Fairmont, Novotel, Emblems and others. In 2021, Accor took in 2.2 billion euros. Its portfolio of 40 brands ranges from economy to luxury and premium brands.Hilton Hotels Corp. (NYSE: HLT), also known as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. is a Tysons Corner, Virginia-based multinational hospitality company that manages and franchises hotels throughout the world.In 1919, Conrad Hilton purchased a hotel in Cisco, Texas, called The Mobley. Over the next few years, Hilton branched out to purchase other Texas hotels, and after changing the name to Hilton Hotels, expanded across the U.S.Today the Hilton Hotel portfolio includes 19 sub-brands with 7,165 total properties in 123 countries and territories. Some of its brands include Waldorf Astoria, Conrad Hotels &amp; Resorts and Canopy by Hilton.Hilton Hotels' stock has a market cap of $39.4 billion.These are well-known hotels and resorts, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of travelers each year. But having too many eggs in one basket is always a problem for a company, and so the enormous percentage of revenue derived from The Marriott brand alone could potentially become a problem for Host Hotels and Resorts.While it’s not likely that such a long-standing company that’s as financially solid as Marriott would go out of business, it’s possible that a negative social, environmental or political event could tarnish its reputation, creating vacancies and putting a dent into Host Hotels and Resorts’ revenue. Investors may remember the food poisoning outbreaks at Chipotle between 2016 and 2018 and what they did to the share price of that stock as consumers stayed away in droves.Having only four hotel chains in its portfolio and deriving 88% of its revenue from such a small number considerably enhances the risk for Host Hotels and Resorts. None of these hotels seems to be at risk of bankruptcy or financial difficulties at the moment. Travel has increased across the globe as the pandemic has abated, and the hotel REIT subsector has done tremendously well year-to-date.Host Hotel and Resorts’ fourth-quarter earnings were reported on Feb. 15. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.44 beat the consensus estimate by $0.02, and revenue of $1.26 billion was $10 million better than the Street’s view. More importantly, the FFO was 51% better than FFO of $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2021, and revenue was a 26.55% increase over revenue of $998 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) also increased from $237.98 in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $325.33.But if increasing interest rates bring about a hard recession, those positive RevPAR numbers could easily change. Companies typically reduce their travel expenses to save money, and consumers put off vacations if the economy deteriorates.Investors may also be wondering why Host Hotels and Resorts pays such a stingy quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. The annual dividend yields 2.83%, fairly low for a REIT. The present payout ratio is only 26.9%. By contrast, Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) pays a 5.8% dividend yield.Host Hotels and Resorts is still playing catch-up from when it suspended its $0.20 dividend after March 2020. It reinstate it in March 2022 but only at a paltry $0.03. But Host Hotels and Resorts also paid a special dividend of $0.20 in December, in addition to its regular $0.12 quarterly dividend payment.The picture appears to be mixed for Host Hotels and Resorts. While it has solid brands and improving metrics, the headwinds of recession and its reliance on a small number of brands for most of its revenue could ultimately lead to a decline in Host Hotels and Regions earnings, translating into a declining share price.From a technical viewpoint, the recent share price collapse below the 200-day moving average is also a negative.

For more details on stock, dividends and other information, see www.pmi.com/dividend.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands.

So it is with blue chips.Fundamentally, the top blue-chip stocks to buy underline high-quality enterprises. Specifically, investors can look at a company’s return on equity (ROE) relative to its industry standards.

Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by a lower expense level and double-digit growth in U.S. outbound new digital customer acquisition (30%).Q4 PerformanceAdjusted operating margin of 15.8% deteriorated from 24.9% a year ago due to lower revenues and increased technology and market-linked investments.

You should consider the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/17/2015.The fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $10.48 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.57%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.20% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 5.56% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 20.48% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskGSLC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of large-capitalization U.S. issuers.Story continuesThe ETF has added about 2.43% so far this year and is down about -6.49% in the last one year (as of 03/10/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $71.02 and $91.01.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 24.05% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 444 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSLC is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $293.57 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $355.23 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Mattel-owned (MAT) Barbie — which first debuted on March 9, 1959 — turns 64 today, and the brand has never been stronger, says CEO Ynon Kreiz.""We expect Barbie to continue to grow,"" Kreiz said in an exclusive interview on Yahoo Finance Live (video above), adding: ""We couldn’t be more excited about Barbie’s long-term prospects.""For International Women's Day this week, the Barbie brand continued its re-imagination — releasing three new dolls representing top business leaders the Wojcicki sisters. And in July, the hotly anticipated 'Barbie' movie will debut in theaters, featuring actors Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.All of this comes after the Barbie brand generated a solid $1.5 billion in gross sales in 2022, according to Statista.A Barbie doll, part of the Olympic Barbie collection from Mattel, is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., February 21, 2020. REUTERS/Carlo AllegriDespite the strength behind Barbie — and other exciting new content and toys with Disney Princess and Monster High slated to hit this year — investors are still slightly worried about the potential growth of Mattel's business following a challenging holiday season for the industry.Mattel stock is down about 26% in the past six months, in part reflecting the company's mixed outlook for profit growth this year as retailers work down excess holiday 2022 inventory. Said unsold inventory is the byproduct of a U.S. consumer cutting back on discretionary purchases in a still-inflationary economy.Mattel reiterated at an investor day on Wednesday that it continues to see adjusted earnings this year of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. If achieved, that would mark a drop from $1.25 last year. And sales are expected to be relatively unchanged year over year.Kreiz says the year is off to a ""good"" start, and the industry's inventory bulge should be less of a headwind in the second half of the year.Most Wall Street analysts appear to be betting that Mattel's fortunes improve as the year progresses.""We remain confident that Mattel is well-positioned to benefit from a strong slate of supporting content across its dolls and vehicles categories in 2023, including Barbie (July movie), Monster High (film sequel and 2nd season of animated series), Disney Princess/Frozen (e.g., The Little Mermaid in May, Wish in November), Mario Kart (April movie), and Fast &amp; Furious (May movie),"" Goldman Sachs analyst Stephen Laszczyk wrote in a note.Story continuesLaszczyk has a Buy rating on Mattel's stock and is modeling for a 19% upside.""We still do believe the industry will be flat to slightly up,"" Kreiz added.

Ynon, always great to get some time with you. Look, big presentation and focus on the reimagination, ongoing reimagination of that Barbie brand. Take us inside the efforts to rebuild that brand and things you are focused on this year.YNON KREIZ: Hi, Brian. Great to see you again. Barbie is such an incredible brand. We saw the brand continue to evolve. We are launching the movie this year on July 21. It's going to be a great event. We believe it has all that it takes to make it a societal event, a cultural event.And it is part of our transformation, to continue to grow our IP-driven toy business and expand our entertainment offering. The Barbie movie has some incredible innovation. It's directed by Greta Gerwig, but an incredible cast led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and Will Ferrell, as well as some incredible actors that will support it.And we expect Barbie to continue to grow. We just launched yesterday another collection of STEM career Barbies led by the Wojcicki sisters. And we couldn't be more excited about Barbie's long-term growth prospects.BRIAN SOZZI: Look, Ynon, I'm 40 years old. I don't much about dolls. But they look to me like what-- they're changing. They reflect more of the society at large. Has that been a focus of you? I know what-- the dolls you just mentioned, to me, those are fearless women in business. Is that right?YNON KREIZ: Exactly. Our brands are all led by a very clear purpose and cultural relevance. Barbie reflects the world as children see it. Barbie's purpose is to inspire the limitless potential in every girl.And the journey has been very distinct. More than half of the Barbies we sell are diverse, not the original white skin and blonde hair Barbie that we used to know. So Barbie very much is about diversity, inclusivity, and empowering girls to reach their limitless potential.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: At the investor day, Ynon, there was a lot of talk about this year being the year of dolls. And I'm holding up two here, one from-- Anna from ""Frozen,"" and one, Snow White from Disney Princess. And this is all part of your efforts to just build out the portfolio of dolls. How much do these brands or brands like this-- how much will they bring in sales this year?YNON KREIZ: Well, we are expanding our dolls portfolio. And Disney Princess and ""Frozen"" is a very important part of that strategy. We have some incredible product of Disney Princess and ""Frozen."" And it will continue to be a key focus for our company.It is one of our core strength. Dolls, vehicles, and infant, toddler, and preschool are the three categories where we are a global leader. And we continue to expand and innovate our product offering. This will be yet another demonstration of our innovation and capabilities when it comes to the dolls category. And it will be an important year for us in this area.BRIAN SOZZI: We've closely been following, Ynon, your efforts to focus more on content. Can you give us an update on that this year?YNON KREIZ: Sure. We own one of the strongest portfolios of children and family entertainment franchises in the world. And that gives us significant opportunities to expand and grow our business and have multiple touchpoints with consumers. And content is an important part of it.We talked a little bit about our movie strategy. ""Barbie"" is one, our first movie. There are 14 other pictures that we are now developing that we already announced. And on the television side, we also see incredible progress with a lot of innovation. We are launching 12 series and specials in 2023.It will have some really exciting offering. We just announced recently the new Hot Wheels show that will be about-- that will launch on NBC later this year. It's a show that will be about a car makeover competition. And it will be-- it's called ""Hot Wheels Ultimate Challenge."" And it will be another representation of more innovation for Mattel.There will be additional content of Barbie on Netflix. And of course, we also announced recently the launch of Barney that will relaunch in 2024. But it will be supported and accompanied by great content, both on television and film that we are now developing for future fans.BRIAN SOZZI: And we'll take this offline. But a Barney was a hot topic for me back in school. But we're not going to-- we'll leave it there. I don't want to get too much into my childhood.But you are fresh off of earnings, of course, too. How much of the inventory overhang in retail from a toy perspective is less-- is left out there? And when does that clear-- get cleared?YNON KREIZ: Yeah, we did talk about elevated inventory that we have entering 2023. It will impact us primarily in the first half. But we expect that to clear over the year. And we do look to see positive increase in consumer demand for 2023.We are working through elevated inventory. But we-- even with the continued macro uncertainty, we are confident about our strategy and plans for the year. There will be several exciting launches and initiatives that we'll bring to the market.We talked about Disney Princess and ""Frozen"" for the year. We are also very excited about the global rollout of ""Monster High."" And of course, the Barbie movie in July, which will stimulate more demand.We continue to execute our multiyear strategy. We have a very balanced portfolio. Our category structure is working very well. We're seeing product in demand. Although it's still early to tell, we're off to a good start in the year. And there's a lot of crosscategory innovation in all of our portfolio.Beyond '23, we believe this strategy-- our strategy will continue to drive top and bottom line growth. And we aim to outpace the toy industry and gain market share.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, this has been a strange week, Ynon, in markets. Now there's concerns about rates going even higher. That has impacted the stock market. Consumers are starting to get jittery. How concerned are you about where the economy is at this point?YNON KREIZ: Well, we continue to monitor the economy. We do expect to see impact on consumer demand, although we still do believe the industry will be flat to slightly up. The toy industry has demonstrated its resilience over time. And we expect it will continue to grow over time.Within that, we do expect to grow market share. But it is important to say that we are entering this year with the strongest balance sheet we've had in many, many years. Even in a challenging market and volatile market in 2022, we continue to improve our leverage ratio and strengthen our financial position.And that gives us flexibility and optionality to continue to improve our position and strengthen our competitive standing. We have begun share repurchases for the year after nine years. And this really tells you how confident we are in our financial strength and opportunities that we see for Mattel to continue to grow and create long-term shareholder value.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, that was confident, Ynon. He-Man-- I believe that's He-Man behind you. That is-- as a toy geek, of course I'm going to recognize these things. Always great to get some time with you, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz. We'll talk to you soon.YNON KREIZ: Thank you so much, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, appreciate it.]"
100,afe999a5-9f13-3eb9-a2d6-e1021d6075c8,SLB,2023-03-10,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Schlumberger (SLB): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-143002466.html,1678372202,STORY,['SLB'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Schlumberger (SLB) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Schlumberger currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.15, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.15 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.4% and 17.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SLBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SLBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Schlumberger here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Schlumberger, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in SLB?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Schlumberger, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.02.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Schlumberger.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the fourth quarter, the strategy returned 13.42% Net of Advisory Fees compared to the Russell 3000 Value Index’s 12.18% return. The robust stock selection in the Information Technology and Healthcare sectors drove the strategy to outperform in the quarter. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.Heartland Opportunistic Value Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) is a containerboard and corrugated packaging products manufacturer. On March 9, 2023, Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) stock closed at $135.60 per share. One-month return of Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) was -3.09%, and its shares lost 9.45% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) has a market capitalization of $12.162 billion.Heartland Opportunistic Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) is the third-largest producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging in North America. Packaging production and pricing is highly correlated to economic activity, so it’s no surprise that PKG is off more than 20% from its April 2022 all-time high. The stock actually held up longer than expected, in part because there was a substantial amount of double ordering by PKG customers in the aftermath of the COVID-19 disruptions. Now that supplies are elevated, it will require lower production and demand stabilization to work off the extra inventory.Though the company’s earnings are expected to fall by around 20% next year, we think PKG could generate close to $500 million in free cash flow. Meanwhile, investor sentiment is likely to improve as the market comes to grips with the economic slowdown, and our best guess is that PKG can work off its excess inventory in the first half of 2023.""Story continuesAmazon.com, Inc.

NVRO recently announced that it has now initiated the U.S. full market launch of its Senza HFX iQ spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, following the completion of a successful limited market release. The system is currently the only SCS System that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize and maintain pain relief using individual patient responses.The Senza HFX iQ system is comprised of the HFX iQ Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG), HFX Trial Stimulator and HFX App. With a new bluetooth-enabled IPG that is upgradeable and connects directly to the HFX App, each patient can input assessments into their smartphone and then receive programming adjustments in real time.Apart from the U.S. approval for Senza HFX iQ, Nevro has submitted for approval in Europe and Australia.The latest launch is expected to strengthen Nevro’s foothold in the SCS therapy business.Significance of the LaunchHFX iQ is expected to combine clinical inputs (such as pain relief and pain score) and Quality of Life inputs (such as pain medication and activity level changes) to provide a personalized program setting for each patient. The system will likely offer both low-frequency and Nevro’s own high-frequency 10 kHz Therapy.The Senza high-frequency 10 kHz Therapy has been validated in both clinical and real-world outcomes and offers unique AI-driven iQ modes specifically for treating painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) and chronic back and leg pain, including non-surgical back pain (NSBP).Per an expert familiar with the use of SCS, the best way to proceed with SCS is with precision medicine, powered by big data and AI. Hence, by combining all the programming experience and clinical outcomes of patients across the United States and providing the same to the patient to monitor and offer them the best program for their exact situation with a tap on the screen holds the promise of improved care.Per Nevro’s management, the Senza HFX iQ system is a significant advancement to SCS therapy as the system will likely apply the big data collected over time to help patients find pain relief faster and maintain that relief over time.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Market Data Forecast, the global SCS market was estimated to be $2032.5 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $3070 million by 2027 at a CAGR of 8.6%. Factors like rising cases of chronic and neuropathic pain and the growing adoption of SCS therapy are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly boost Nevro’s business.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Nevro announced its fourth-quarter 2022 results, where it saw an improvement in overall top-line and bottom-line results and robust domestic revenues. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures were also recorded.The improvement in U.S. PDN trial was also registered. The robust performance of Nevro’s new AI-powered HFX iQ SCS System in the limited market release, with positive feedback from physicians and patients, raised optimism about the stock.In December 2022, Nevro announced that two abstracts for PDN and NSBP were accepted for podium presentations at the North American Neuromodulation Society Annual Meeting and would be presented during the late-breaking plenary sessions in January.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 53.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 11.9% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 7.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Nevro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

CTLT is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its product and service launches over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with a slew of strategic deals over the past few months, is expected to contribute further. Catalent’s operation in a competitive landscape and forex woes pose threats.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 29% compared with the 13.9% decline of the industry and 7.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global developer and supplier of better treatments has a market capitalization of $12.57 billion. Catalent projects 7.7% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Catalent’s earnings yield of 4.5% is favorable to the industry’s negative yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product and Service Launches: We are upbeat about Catalent’s product and service launches over the past few months. Last month, the company announced the launch of TASCENSO orally disintegrating tablet (ODT), its first product to treat multiple sclerosis patients in the United States.In January, Catalent announced the launch of its new Case Management Service, specifically designed to address the unique challenges associated with the safe and timely delivery of advanced therapies to patients by providing professional supply chain oversight from program start to finish.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about Catalent’s robust growth opportunities via its recent tie-ups and buyouts. During its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in February, the company confirmed that it had extended its collaboration with Moderna to broaden manufacturing partnership across multiple products and formats in North America and Europe.In January, Catalent announced that it had executed a development and license agreement with Ethicann Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop Ethicann’s clinical drug pipeline using Catalent’s proprietary Zydis ODT technology.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Catalent’s solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 fall results buoy optimism. The year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment at constant exchange rate is impressive. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well. Catalent has undertaken some facility expansion activities over the past few months, raising our optimism.DownsidesForex Woes: Catalent has significant operations outside the United States. Hence, changes in the exchange rates or any other applicable currency to the U.S. dollar will affect its operations. Volatility in currency exchange rates and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort the company may undertake to manage or mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies.Stiff Competition: Catalent operates in a highly competitive market, wherein it competes with multiple companies, including those offering advanced delivery technologies and outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing. The company also competes in some cases with the internal operations of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health customers with manufacturing capabilities and chooses to source these services internally.Estimate TrendCatalent has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2.2% south to $3.11.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, suggesting a 9.7% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue estimate of $1.17 billion, suggesting an 8.1% plunge from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

While streamers such as Netflix, Apple, and Amazon have garnered 19 nominations this year (down from 37 in 2022), traditional Hollywood studios have reclaimed center stage for Hollywood’s biggest night. Here's how we got here and why the decline in streaming nominations may not seem so dire as it looks.Watch: Yahoo Finance Live previews Hollywoods biggest night here.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]ALEXANDRA CANAL: The 2023 Oscars is looking a bit different this year, as streaming giants come up short, and the focus shifts once again to traditional Hollywood studios. Here's how we got here and why the decline in streaming nominations might not be as dire as it looks.Streamers garnered about half the amount of nominations in 2023 compared to 2022, with the big three Netflix, Apple, and Amazon receiving just 19 nods in total versus last year's 37. Netflix was the most nominated of the bunch, with the 16 total nods, followed by Apple with two, and Amazon with just one. Keep in mind, Apple actually walked away with Best Picture in 2022 Thanks to ""CODA.""At the time, the win was categorized as a huge breakthrough moment for streamers. And it seems like, finally, the lines between traditional film studios and streaming exclusives had been blurred.But it seems like the Academy isn't giving in that easily. In fact, streamers were completely shut out of popular categories this year like Best Director. Remember, Jane Campion won in 2022 for Netflix's ""Power of the Dog."" Not only that, but the number of nominations has been on a steady downward trend in recent years.Still, there's one big question to ask. Does this all matter? Oscar viewership has struggled, especially as the top moments usually end up on Twitter or YouTube relatively quickly. According to Nielsen, 2022's Academy Awards drew in 16.6 million viewers. That was actually up 58% from 2021's record low of 10.5 million but still the second worst viewership number in the show's 94-year history.Story continuesAnd let's take a movie like ""Knives Out, Glass Onion"" for example, only one Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, but still the fourth most watched Netflix original of all time, with nearly 280,000,000 hours viewed in its first 28 days on the platform. That's a pretty strong showing for a film not rolling in nominations.- This is truly delightful.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Or what about ""Top Gun, Maverick,"" ""Avatar, The Way of Water,"" two of the highest grossing films in 2022 and yet nominated just two and four times, respectively.- Just want to manage expectations.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You see, before streaming, there were obvious boosts in box office receipts after a film was nominated or won an Oscar. But with all the changes in media, it's hard to really judge the, quote, unquote, ""payout"" of an Oscar win especially for streamers, which care most about subscribers.So even though streaming platforms may not be enjoying the same level of Oscar attention as they received in the past, it doesn't mean they don't have just as much, if not more visibility, with hundreds of millions of paying users at their fingertips.That being said, the Oscars is the biggest awards show stage of them all, with many industry watchers adamant that Academy Award wins and nominations do still matter. It just might not matter as much to the streamers, which are way more focused on subscribers and profitability than Oscar statuettes.[AUDIO LOGO]]"

110,5cceb060-2c0f-335b-9018-eaad9c2e2d9d,PSX,2023-03-10,7 Crude Oil Stocks to Buy as Tensions Rise,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-crude-oil-stocks-buy-213432350.html,1678138472,STORY,"['MUSA', 'PSX', 'COP', 'XOM', 'ENB']","[Under normal circumstances involving geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, conflict tends to negatively affect crude oil stocks to buy. For instance, in 2019, China stated it would impose tariffs on U.S. crude oil imports, sending prices down sharply. However, the post-coronavirus new normal likely sparked a fresh paradigm for the hydrocarbon sector.This time around, threatening to implement tariffs on critical energy resources would be an onerous action to take. With China recently reopening its economy, commercial activity should rise. Naturally, this framework will probably translate to greater resource consumption, thus boding well for crude oil stocks to buy. But here’s the wrinkle: Beijing knows that the Federal Reserve is committed to controlling inflation. However, should China step on the economic gas pedal, global inflation may rise, impacting the Fed’s monetary policy. Therefore, with the potential for cynicism to abound, these are the crude oil stocks to buy.XOMExxon Mobil$113.81COPConocoPhillips$109.56SHELShell$62.57TRPTC Pipelines$41.21ENBEnbridge$38.82MUSAMurphy USA$260.91PSXPhillips 66$103.98InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsExxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) blossomed into one of the biggest vertically integrated hydrocarbon specialists in the world. Presently, Exxon commands a market capitalization of $463 billion. Since the start of the year, XOM gained nearly 6%, slightly pipping the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index. Moving forward, though, XOM could break out to a convincing lead.After incurring a major blow following the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, Exxon’s books look considerably more appealing. For example, its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.15, reflecting low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, the company really comes alive. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.9%, beating out 75% of its rivals. Further, its net margin is 14%, above 66% of other crude oil stocks to buy. At the moment, Exxon offers a forward yield of 3.23%. It features 40 years of consecutive dividend increases.Story continuesLastly, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $126.94, implying over 12% upside potential.ConocoPhillips (COP)Image of an oil wells with an orange-red sky at dusk. oil stocks to buy with safe dividendsSource: ShutterstockSpecializing in hydrocarbon exploration and production (upstream), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has operations in 15 countries. At the present juncture, the company commands a market cap of $133.5 billion. Since the Jan. opener, COP dipped 4%. However, in the trailing year, shares managed to gain over 8% of equity value. For those seeking a solid deal on crude oil stocks to buy, COP makes a good case for itself. According to Gurufocus.com’s analysis on ConocoPhillips’ discounted cash flow (DCF), COP’s fair value should be $181.16. However, at time of writing, COP trades hands for $108.64.In addition, the company enjoys significant strengths operationally. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 28.4%, beating out 87% of its peers. Further, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period pings at 52.9%, outpacing 85.63% of the industry. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg COP as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $139.75, implying nearly 29% upside potential.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the world’s biggest crude oil stocks to buy, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) makes for an interesting “hybrid” case. While its core enterprises focus on hydrocarbons, the company also invests in green technologies. Specifically, Shell will build Europe’s largest renewable hydrogen plant, which should attract new investors. The plant will be operational in 2025.In the meantime, investors can enjoy an enticing argument for crude oil stocks to buy right now. Specifically, the market prices SHEL at a trailing multiple of 5.46. As a discount to earnings, Shell ranks better than 64.53% of the competition. In addition, SHEL trades at a forward multiple of 6.01. Here, the company ranks better than 60.91% of the field. Like the other crude oil stocks to buy, Shell delivers on the operational front. For revenue, FCF and book growth, the energy giant ranks above at least 64% of the industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg SHEL as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $69.61, implying nearly 12% upside potential.TC Pipelines (TRP)Illustration of oil pump jacks on sunset sky background to represent oil and gas stocksSource: ShutterstockA major North American energy company, TC Pipelines (NYSE:TRP) focuses on the midstream component of the sector’s value chain. This segment mainly deals with transportation and storage of critical resources. Currently, TC Pipelines commands a market cap of just over $42 billion. Since the start of the year, shares gained 6% of equity value.To be fair, it hasn’t been an easy road. In the past 365 days, TRP dropped nearly 27%. However, for patient investors, it could be an intriguing name among crude oil stocks to buy. For one thing, Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value labels TRP as modestly undervalued. Operationally, TC’s three-year FCF growth rate stands at 33.2%, above nearly 72% of its peers. Notably, TC’s forward yield measures 6.62%, beating out the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. In fairness, though, the payout ratio of 85.58% will need to be monitored. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg TRP as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $44.65, implying 8% upside potential.Enbridge (ENB)Pipelines in the desertSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.comAnother midstream specialist, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) features a crude oil system that consists of 28,661 kilometers (17,809 miles) of pipelines. As well, its natural gas pipelines stretch for 38,300 kilometers (23,799 miles). At this juncture, Enbridge carries a market cap of $78.7 billion. Since the start of the year, ENB slipped roughly half-a-percent below parity.As with other midstream crude oil stocks to buy, Enbridge might require some patience. However, the underlying business is effectively a natural monopoly due to the extreme barrier to entry. In addition, Enbridge operates a decently and consistently profitable enterprise. Its highlight is its operating margin, which pings at 15.35% (above 61.48% of the industry). Similar to TC Pipelines, Enbridge offers generous passive income with a forward yield of 6.8%. However, its payout ratio does stand at 117.11%, drawing some sustainability concerns. Also, covering analysts peg ENB as a consensus hold. However, their average price target came out to $44.03, implying over 13% upside potential.Murphy USA (MUSA)miniature oil barrel and oil well figures on top of stack of moneySource: ShutterstockOperating in the downstream component of the energy value chain, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) operates a chain of retail gasoline stations. Primarily, they’re located (smartly) near discount-oriented big-box retailers, facilitating maximum customer volume. Currently, the company commands a market cap of $5.63 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MUSA declined by 5%.Still, in the past 365 days, MUSA gained a blistering 43%. And it could rise even more. With normalization trends materializing in the personal and professional realms, Murphy could be one of the more enticing crude oil stocks to buy. In addition, the company provides an attractive bargain. Right now, the market prices MUSA at a trailing multiple of 9.23. As a discount to earnings, Murphy ranks better than 76.79% of the competition. Also, MUSA trades at a forward multiple of 11.26. Here, the company ranks better than 70.87% of its peers.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg MUSA as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $314.25, implying over 21% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)Image of an oil wells with a dark blue skySource: ShutterstockA spinoff of ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) focuses on the downstream segment of the energy industry: refining, chemical and retail. At the moment, Phillips 66 carries a market cap of $49.18 billion. Since the start of the year, PSX gained 5% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 26%.While it’s already performed well, PSX remains one of the crude oil stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices PSX at a trailing multiple of 4.62. As a discount to earnings, the enterprise ranks better than 69.3% of the industry. Also, PSX trades at a sales multiple of 0.3. Here, the company ranks better than nearly 81% of the field. While Phillips 66 falls a bit under average when it comes to passive income for its sector, overall, it holds its own with a forward yield of 3.96%. Also, the payout ratio is quite low at 32.65%. Therefore, sustainability of the yield shouldn’t be a concern.Finally, covering analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $127.11, implying nearly 20% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Its operating subsidiaries are: PSEG Power, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) and PSEG Long Island. (PRNewsfoto/PSEG)""PSEG's growth objectives are driven by regulated operations at our best-in-class utility, PSE&amp;G, which is expected to contribute ~90% of our non-GAAP Operating Earnings in 2023.  PSE&amp;G's robust 2023 to 2027 capital spending program of $15.5 billion to $18 billion drives a 6% to 7.5% compound annual growth in rate base over the five-year period, supported by PSEG's solid balance sheet,"" said LaRossa.LaRossa continued, ""The funding of PSE&amp;G's investments in infrastructure modernization and decarbonization will be complemented by our decision to retain our 3,766 megawatt nuclear fleet following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the establishment of the nuclear production tax credit (PTC) that is expected to stabilize nuclear economics into the next decade. The PTC enables multiple paths to optimize our nuclear operations via capacity uprate projects, fuel cycle extension, and potential license extension with modest investment.  Along with our decision to retain the nuclear fleet, we previously announced our exit from offshore wind generation with the sale of our 25% equity interest in the Ocean Wind 1 generation project to our joint venture partner, Ørsted, in a transaction we expect will close in the first-half of 2023.""  Story continuesPSEG will also announce:It re-affirms its recently narrowed 2023 non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share. PSEG also reiterates its 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth rate for the 2023 to 2027 period.The PSE&amp;G 2023 to 2032 capital spending program of $34 billion to $40 billion – which reflects planned future investments in Transmission, Electric Distribution, Gas Distribution, and Clean Energy.

Guided by its Powering Progress vision, PSEG aims to power a future where people use less energy, and it's cleaner, safer and delivered more reliably than ever.

(PSE&amp;G), PSEG Power and PSEG Long Island (https://corporate.pseg.com). Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresManagement uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG's financial performance to previous financial results. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of gains (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items.The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income, which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Due to the forward-looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because comparable GAAP measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be required for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably project without unreasonable effort MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain of the matters discussed in this release about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including, without limitation, future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects, consequences and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

""Ultimately, this figure accounted for about 62 per cent of total imports.""McGowan on Wednesday was forced to comment on an issue involving China, claiming he ""didn't know"" about an alleged problem with gold bars sold by the Perth Mint to the Shanghai Gold Exchange during a time he had ministerial responsibility for the refinery.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners current affairs documentary series on Monday quoted a leaked internal report that the Perth Mint was facing a potential A$9 billion (US$5.93 billion) recall of gold bars after selling allegedly diluted bullion to China.While the gold remained above general industry standards, the report estimated up to 100 tonnes of gold sent to the Shanghai Gold Exchange potentially did not comply with its strict purity standards for silver content.The Perth Mint said on Wednesday that ""there is no question about the gold purity and value of the gold bars the Perth Mint has sold to customers in China"".It was made aware that some of its 1kg bars did not meet the non-gold specifications of the Shanghai Gold Exchange in September 2021, the company added.""As part of the Perth Mint's review of refining practices, new processes were implemented,"" the company said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Many stocks from China have been heavily oversold last year, with p/e ratios dropping 30-40% from the peak in 2021, so they have the potential for a quicker rebound than their peers in the US, should the optimism get back to equity markets.Technically, all stock indices are now either in a consolidation or correction mode. Though, for HK50, there’s a strong support level ahead, built with a 200-day moving average. Should the price test this level, it may rebound higher and resume the bullish upswing.Natural GasNatural gas is traded in a form of futures on New York Mercantile Exchange, which is the part of CME Group. According to reports from CFTC, net long position of commercial traders for natural gas futures has reached the 2-year peak. That usually represents an intermediate-term bullish signal.Warm winter’s temperatures had led to accumulation of substantial inventories on natural gas in Europe and the US: gas storage in Europe was around 60% with a seasonal average of 37%. Inventories for the US were almost 20% higher than their average for two years. This resulted in a massive drop of Natural gas prices.Technically, there was a parabolic acceleration to the downside, with a potentially reversal formation at the bottom. The price area of 2.7 – 3 has become a resistance, but the price action seems to be robust to sell-offs amid correction for oil and gold.

The dollar fell from recent highs, while Treasury yields also retreated.The reading spurred some bets that nonfarm payrolls data due later in the day will show some signs of cooling in February, after topping estimates for 10 consecutive months. Analysts are expecting a sharp drop in payrolls from the prior month.A cooling labor market gives the Federal Reserve less economic headroom to hike interest rates, which is positive for metal markets. But a separate reading showed this week that private payrolls remained robust in the month through mid-February.Spot gold was flat at $1,830.06 an ounce, while gold futures steadied at $1,835.25 an ounce by 20:15 ET (01:15 GMT). Both instruments rose around 0.9% on Thursday.But gold was still down about 2% for the week, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that U.S. interest rates are likely to rise beyond market expectations, given recent strength in inflation and the jobs market.The dollar rallied on his comments, while some short-term Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.Powell noted that future rate hikes will be largely determined by incoming economic readings. U.S. inflation data for February is due next week, ahead of the Fed’s policy meeting on March 22.Markets have begun pricing in a greater possibility of the Fed hiking rates by a larger 50 basis points this month, following hotter-than-expected inflation readings for January.

Many executives agreed, but said the U.S. had to find a way to ensure domestic supply without sparking a trade war with the world's second biggest economy, already a dominant supplier of critical minerals and components used in everything from electric vehicle batteries to solar panels.U.S. tensions with Beijing have been rising over issues ranging from Chinese spying to Taiwan's status and China's position on Russia's war in Ukraine.""It's just clear, to say it directly, that China has too much of a chokehold on critical minerals, on critical processing and upstream technologies, and solar,"" White House energy adviser John Podesta told the conference.""We let that go. That was a mistake. We need to get it back.""He and other officials at the conference cited Europe's historic reliance on Russian fuel as an example of risks of relying on global rivals. State Department energy envoy Amos Hochstein and Under Secretary Jose Fernandez were among officials giving speeches or participating in panel discussions.Since Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, 2022, Moscow has cut natural gas supplies to Europe. Soaring energy costs forced Europe's industry and consumers to cut consumption, while governments and utilities scrambled to find alternative supplies.Europe will remain vulnerable for years to spikes in global gas prices caused by even small gas supply outages, executives and officials at the conference said.As the world moves toward a low-carbon economy, Podesta told attendees, ""We need to make sure the supply chains are secure, that we don't have a repeat of what we saw with the Russian chokehold on fossil fuels.""Story continuesHochstein said the United States needs to ""learn the lessons from the previous era, the 20th century fossil industry, and make sure we have as much production at home and make sure that the supply chains are secure.""The Biden administration has encouraged domestic clean energy manufacturing investment. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, provides hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives to companies opening new projects on American soil.Despite U.S. comments encouraging a decoupling in trade with China, the two countries in recent months have made more energy supply deals related tonatural gas.EXECUTIVES WARYEnergy executives agreed on the value of a diverse and secure supply chain. But some said the clean energy transition would be smoother if Washington could keep trade flowing and relations friendly with China, where products are often cheaper.""I’m real worried about the U.S. not finding a way to talk to China. I think it’s very important for the future of the world and reducing CO2 that, on an issue as critical as climate, we need to be able to – at least – talk together,"" said Andy Marsh, CEO of hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power.""On the other side, I think nations need to think about their own energy independence, and it’s really important for us liberal democracies to make sure we have integrated, diversified supply chains,"" he said.In the mining industry, tensions with China could dampen investment in long-term projects, including in China itself, said Richard Adkerson, CEO of miner Freeport-McMoRan.""The situation with China is very complicated and clearly if the situation ... resulted in a major trade war between the U.S. and China, it would have an impact on the world's economy broadly,"" he said.That risk ""is overhanging our industry right now. It's another factor that makes companies reluctant to initiate investments in long-term projects to meet the coming demand for copper,"" he said. Copper, used in everything from electric vehicles to the power lines and transmission grids, is essential to an increasingly electrified society.The United States could not possibly become completely independent from China-made components such as electrolyzers for hydrogen production, batteries and solar panels, said Takajiro Ishikawa, CEO of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Americas.""There has to be a lot more cooperation between nations,"" he said. ""For America to win its challenge against climate change, you cannot build everything in Japan or America.""The world's two top economies need to combine their industrial and political power to build the energy industry of the future, some participants said.""China and U.S. have to engage on this,"" said Mark Hutchinson, CEO of Fortescue Future Industries.""Trade conquers all at the end of the day.""

The dollar fell 0.4% after hitting over three-month highs on Wednesday, underpinned by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's message that interest rates will have to go higher and possibly faster than investors previously anticipated. The greenback fell after data showed initial jobless claims rose 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 4. The figure was well above a Reuters estimate for 195,000, assuaging fears that the U.S. labour market is too tight. The Mexican peso slipped 0.3% as data showed core consumer prices slowed more than expected in the year to February. ""Today's (inflation) print reduces the odds that (central bank) chooses to go ahead with a 50 bps hike, though incoming data as well as the outlook for the Fed remain key influences on the bank's decision,"" Scotiabank economists said in a note. The Brazilian real fell 0.1% against the dollar, while the Colombian peso led gains among most Latin American currencies, rising 1.0% against the greenback. A weaker dollar helped currencies of the world's biggest copper producers Chile and Peru rise more than 0.5% each despite falling copper prices. Latam stocks slid 0.4%. Brazil's Bovespa index lost 0.3%, led by shares of healthcare company Hapvida, which plunged 24.3%, after the firm said it was ""studying mechanisms to improve its capital structure"".

This represents an annual dividend yield of 2.33% based on its share price worth as of Mar 8. The annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s yield of 1.59%.This signifies General Dynamics’s strength in business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payoutWill General Dynamics Sustain Dividend Hikes?The increase in the dividend payout is backed by strength in the business, which enables the company to register growth in earnings and sales. Hence, it is imperative to mention that General Dynamics recorded a 5.6% increase in its earnings in the last reported quarter, while sales recorded a growth rate of 5.4% from the previous year’s reported figure. Such improvement in numbers must have triggered the hike in the dividend payout for shareholders.Also, the ability to distribute excess cash to shareholders is underpinned by a company’s strategy and strong cash flow position. In this context, it is imperative to mention that the company recorded a growth of 7.2% in cash flow from operating activities, while its free cash flow registered an increase of 2.4% in 2022. Such enhancement in cash positions complements a company’s intent to increase dividends for shareholders.General Dynamics’ backlog strength also plays a significant role in accomplishing the objectives of its business and supporting such dividend payouts. It recorded a total backlog of $91.10 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 2.6% from third-quarter 2022’s backlog of $88.80 billion.All the aforementioned factors collectively enabled the company to consistently increase dividends for its shareholders. The company paid a total dividend of $1.4 billion in 2022, compared with $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. General Dynamics’ has a long history of increasing annual dividends and has been doing the same for the last 26 years. The company repurchased 5.3 million of our outstanding shares for $1.2 billion in 2022 while it has 6.7 million remains in its authorization to be repurchased.Story continuesCourtesy of the strong fundamentals and stable demand for its products, General Dynamics may continue to reward shareholders with more impressive dividend hikes as well as share repurchase activity.Peer MovesDefense companies generally have long-term contracts with government entities which ensures stable income and cash flow.

If you want to see more best stocks under $100, go directly to 5 Best Stocks Under $100.Stocks are very uncertain in the short term as pretty much anything can happen. Earnings can be better than expected or they can be worse than expected. Individual news events can also be better than expected or worse than expected.Currently, the market is pretty uncertain.On March 7, one news event negatively affected the market with the S&amp;P 500 declining by 1.53% to below 4000. On March 7, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.""As a result, the peak level of interest rates could be higher than previously expected. If interest rates rise too much, the economy, while currently expanding, could slow or even contract.If the economy slows substantially enough, overall corporate earnings could decline. If earnings decline too much, there could be more of a headwind for the overall stock market.While the short term is uncertain, the odds are still good that in the long term many blue chip companies with substantial competitive advantages can generate fairly decent returns.Many blue chip companies are profitable and return excess capital through dividends. For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.Many blue chip companies that are profitable also buy back stock as another way of returning capital back to shareholders. If they buy back more stock than they issue and their earnings either stays the same or increases, the buybacks will help their EPS growth.Owning one blue chip is not a high probability way of benefiting from market growth in the long term however. Management of blue chips could make a bad acquisition for instance, or they might position their company incorrectly in an important field. As a result, the overall return of an individual blue chip might not do as well in the long term even though the company has numerous competitive advantages.Story continuesOne potential way to avoid that is to have a well diversified portfolio of leading blue chip stocks across many different sectors and holding for the long term.Energy, electricity, industryPhoto by Matthew Henry on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best Stocks Under $100, we selected 15 blue chip stocks with competitive advantages that had stock prices under $100 as of the close of March 7, 2023.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.15 Best Stocks Under $10015.

129,72dd07df-e8f6-3bff-a1d5-7a312726a81b,MAS,2023-03-10,20 Biggest Plumbing Supply Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-plumbing-supply-companies-130529617.html,1678453529,STORY,"['AOS', 'WTS', 'FAST', 'GWW', 'MSM', 'MAS', 'WSO-B', 'EME', 'POOL', 'CRH']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 biggest plumbing supply companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Plumbing Supply Companies in the World. While not as glitzy or glamorous as high technology, the plumbing industry is still one of the most important ones out there. The ability of humans to live and grow in large cities is dependent on modern day necessities such as plumbing, which includes services like hot water and waste disposal. Broadly speaking, there are six kinds of plumbing, including water supply, sanitary, gas fitting, drainage, roofing, and other services. And while modern day plumbing quietly chugs away at the bottom of cities and megastructures, systems such as sewage drainage have been around for thousands of years.The Plumbing Industry: An AnalysisThe growth in human population and the corresponding rise in living standards has also transformed the plumbing industry into quite a lucrative sector. For instance, a research report from Allied Markets Research believes that the plumbing components industry was worth $58.5 billion in 2019, and from then until 2027, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6% to sit at an estimated $78 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm divides the industry across both product categories and end use. For the former, the sector is segmented along fittings, manifolds, pipes, and valves. Out of these, pipes is the largest segment, accounting for a higher share than the other three categories combined. However, the fittings segment is expected to outpace the industry in terms of overall growth, through an estimated CAGR of 7.5%. The low share, high growth rate mix is also mirrored in products end use since while residential demand holds the higher market share, the nonresidential segment is expected to have the highest growth.As is the case with nearly every other sector, the plumbing industry is also witnessing the growing adaptability of technology. These include interesting new devices such as water leak detection devices and brain pipes. The former is part of a group of gadgets called the Internet of Things (IoT) and they include leak detectors that connect to the home WiFi network and are also capable of detecting moisture and humidity levels. These devices also feature automatic water shut-off features that aim at preventing water loss and drainage in case of a leak. The latter arguably sound more interesting, since they are called 'brain pipes'. These are part of a system that monitors all the pipes in a house and then monitors water usage for off nominal events such as a leak. If the system detects any such occurrence, it notifies the user and then shuts off the water supply to prevent potential damage and water loss.Story continuesThese days, all that anyone can talk about (or worry about) is recession. Last year's global energy and commodity price shocks coupled with rising inflation and high interest rates have created concerns for an economic downturn necessary to bring down prices and to ensure that elevated inflation does not become permanent. Well, according to the private equity industry, this might not be the case for the plumbing industry since investments in the sector grew significantly even during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic when most cities and counties were in lockdown. This stability for the sector even during an economic downturn is aided by the fact that home repairs continue even when business is down, particularly since plumbing is an essential service. Another reason plumbing tends to stay resilient in a volatile economy is that it is easier to scale the business up or down by adding or removing variable capacity markers such as vans or employees. Other businesses, such as large scale manufacturing operations, do not have such flexibility.Looking at the broader macroeconomic outlook, the U.S. economy is refusing to slow down despite the Fed's best efforts. This is partly due to large homeowner savings, which is enabling them to maintain buying behavior. These were also on the mind of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) chief executive officer Mr. Marvin Ellison, who shared during the firm's Q4 2022 earnings call that:From our perspective the core drivers of our business, disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of housing stock, remain supportive. Consumer savings are still roughly $1.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic, with 85% concentrated in the top 40% of income owners who are more likely to be homeowners. Homeowners continue to enjoy record levels of equity in their homes, nearly $330,000 on average.Even if there is a modest decline in home prices, the level of equity built up during the pandemic would not be meaningfully eroded. And the housing stock continues to age with 50% of US homes over 41 years old, the oldest since World War II. These factors, along with strong millennial household formation, baby boomers’ increasing preference to age in place, and more widespread remote work will continue to be tailwinds for our business. And given the slowdown in housing turnover is driven by higher rates and low supply rather than demand, we continue to see a nationwide trend of trading up in place with consumers opting to upgrade their existing home to meet their evolving needs. All of these dynamics give us confidence in the medium and longer term outlook for the industry.Today, we'll look at some of the largest plumbing supply companies in the world, with the largest being Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Poultry Companies in the World.Analysis of the Poultry IndustryAccording to the Economic Research Service wing in the US Department of Agriculture, poultry has become the most consumed livestock commodity globally in the past 20 years. The demand for poultry has increased significantly in developing and emerging countries, where production prospects have earlier been limited due to a lack of resources. The rising demand has increased global imports as well. Poultry is expected to remain the most consumed livestock in the next decade as well. As a result, numerous companies are continuously working on enhancing their yield. Brazil, France, the UK, Saudi Arabia, and the US have emerged as major players in the poultry industry. Brazil is the world's biggest poultry producer, and the country is expected to occupy the top position in the next decade as well. On the other hand, the US is expected to lose a proportion of its market share in the next ten years. Due to continuous improvement in trade because of globalization, poultry trade has gained significant visibility.The reason for the momentum in the poultry industry can be attributed to the fact that chickens mature and achieve market weight at the fastest pace compared to any other livestock. Furthermore, they have the best feed-to-meat conversion process among all livestock. Furthermore, chickens do not require vast open spaces like other livestock and are ideally raised in confined and closed spaces. As a result, the production of poultry has now become more practical and affordable in developing markets. Global poultry production increased to 131 million tons in 2019 as opposed to 94 million tons in 2009. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.37% for the period. Out of the total global production, around 20 million tons, or 15.2%, are exported to different markets by producers.Story continuesMeanwhile, in monetary terms, the size of the global poultry industry is set to increase by 7.6% YoY from $352.02 billion in 2022 to $378.84 billion in 2023. According to the Business Research company, the size of the poultry industry is set to grow at an average rate of 6.5% every year to $487.39 billion by 2027. Some of the biggest poultry companies in the world, such as Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), BRF S.A. (NYSE:BRFS), and Wens Foodstuff Group Co., Ltd.

The dollar fell from recent highs, while Treasury yields also retreated.The reading spurred some bets that nonfarm payrolls data due later in the day will show some signs of cooling in February, after topping estimates for 10 consecutive months. Analysts are expecting a sharp drop in payrolls from the prior month.A cooling labor market gives the Federal Reserve less economic headroom to hike interest rates, which is positive for metal markets. But a separate reading showed this week that private payrolls remained robust in the month through mid-February.Spot gold was flat at $1,830.06 an ounce, while gold futures steadied at $1,835.25 an ounce by 20:15 ET (01:15 GMT). Both instruments rose around 0.9% on Thursday.But gold was still down about 2% for the week, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that U.S. interest rates are likely to rise beyond market expectations, given recent strength in inflation and the jobs market.The dollar rallied on his comments, while some short-term Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.Powell noted that future rate hikes will be largely determined by incoming economic readings. U.S. inflation data for February is due next week, ahead of the Fed’s policy meeting on March 22.Markets have begun pricing in a greater possibility of the Fed hiking rates by a larger 50 basis points this month, following hotter-than-expected inflation readings for January. Strength in the labor market has also underpinned U.S. price pressures.Rising interest rates bode poorly for metal markets, as they support yields and increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Story continuesOther precious metals crept higher on Friday, with platinum and silver futures advancing around 0.1% each. But both metals were headed for sharp weekly losses.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose on Friday, but were also set to lose for the week, as weak Chinese economic data added to concerns over rising interest rates.Copper futures rose 0.1% to $4.0113 a pound, and were set to lose 1.4% this week.Related ArticlesGold prices muted ahead of nonfarm payrolls, set for weekly lossesOil prices rangebound ahead of payrolls data, set for dismal weekOil prices slip 1% to two-week low on recession worries]"

The news seemed to have struck the right chords with investors as share prices rose 1.7% to close at $121.20 yesterday.Based on the closing price, as of Mar 8, the proposed dividend affirms a yield of 2.6%. A steady dividend payout is part of the long-term strategy of Qualcomm to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. In addition, healthy dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of its strengths.The current hike reflects the inherent financial strength of the company and the strong cash flow generated from continued focus on high-margin businesses and healthy execution of operating plans. Qualcomm generated $3,095 million of net cash from operating activities in first-quarter fiscal 2023 compared with $2,057 million a year ago. At quarter-end, the company had $4,808 million in cash and cash equivalents.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, the chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches.The company is well-positioned to benefit from solid 5G traction with greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream to meet its long-term revenue targets. Qualcomm is witnessing strong demand in emerging product categories such as XR and wearables, along with 4G and 5G mobile broadband devices and rapid adoption of Wi-Fi 6. It is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. This augurs well for the long-term growth proposition of the company.The buyout of Veoneer, Inc. offers Qualcomm a firmer footing in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology as it aims to extend the Snapdragon Ride Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) portfolio. The Arriver business of Veoneer operates the dedicated software unit focused on sensor perception and drive policy, including a full stack of features and functions.With the acquisition, Qualcomm has incorporated Arriver's Computer Vision, Drive Policy and Driver Assistance assets into its ADAS portfolio to deliver an open and competitive platform for automakers to better compete with rivals within the self-driving vehicle market. This, in turn, is likely to augment its automotive business as it strives to boost revenues beyond chipmaking for the smartphone market.All these positive drivers and sound financial management probably led to the quarterly dividend hike.Shares of the company have lost 21.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQualcomm presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The world’s biggest corporate travel agency has made hotels a “strategic priority” as it leverages the special relationship it has with Expedia.Amex GBT bought corporate travel platform Egencia from Expedia Group a couple of years ago, and as part of the deal gained access to its vast hotel content.For the three months to Dec. 31, 2022, the recovery of hotel transactions was at 80 percent, 14 percentage points above air, Amex GBT revealed in its full-year results on Thursday.“One of the key elements is that it has been a strategic priority to increase content and attachment rates, bringing in all the content from Expedia,” said CEO Paul Abbott during an earnings call.The hotel content is then displayed in its Neo and Egencia corporate booking tools. A “hotel attachment” is when a hotel booking is attached to an airline or rail reservation.Increased meeting bookings also boosted hotel revenue, particularly for groups of under 50 people. Amex GBT’s meetings and events division is more than recovered, compared with 2019, Abbott added, and those smaller meetings now represent its fastest growing area of business.Amex GBT’s sales of flights for the quarter seem to have flatlined at about 66 percent of 2019 levels, the same amount as in the third quarter of 2022. It was 64 percent in the second quarter.Prioritizing hotel content could pay off in 2023 too, especially as American Airlines readies to pull 40 percent of its airfares out of traditional retail channels in April.Rail travel in Europe was also gaining ground.Overall, Abbott said the travel agency was outpacing the broader market. During last year’s fourth quarter Amex GBT’s revenue had recovered to 75 percent compared to the 2019 fourth quarter. He cited the Global Business Travel Association’s recent Outlook Poll, which placed domestic travel booking levels at around two-thirds of 2019 levels, and international business travel at 54 percent.Story continuesFor the 12 months to Dec. 31, 2022, Amex GBT made a net loss of $229 million.

This represents an annual dividend yield of 2.33% based on its share price worth as of Mar 8. The annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s yield of 1.59%.This signifies General Dynamics’s strength in business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payoutWill General Dynamics Sustain Dividend Hikes?The increase in the dividend payout is backed by strength in the business, which enables the company to register growth in earnings and sales. Hence, it is imperative to mention that General Dynamics recorded a 5.6% increase in its earnings in the last reported quarter, while sales recorded a growth rate of 5.4% from the previous year’s reported figure. Such improvement in numbers must have triggered the hike in the dividend payout for shareholders.Also, the ability to distribute excess cash to shareholders is underpinned by a company’s strategy and strong cash flow position. In this context, it is imperative to mention that the company recorded a growth of 7.2% in cash flow from operating activities, while its free cash flow registered an increase of 2.4% in 2022. Such enhancement in cash positions complements a company’s intent to increase dividends for shareholders.General Dynamics’ backlog strength also plays a significant role in accomplishing the objectives of its business and supporting such dividend payouts. It recorded a total backlog of $91.10 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 2.6% from third-quarter 2022’s backlog of $88.80 billion.All the aforementioned factors collectively enabled the company to consistently increase dividends for its shareholders. The company paid a total dividend of $1.4 billion in 2022, compared with $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. General Dynamics’ has a long history of increasing annual dividends and has been doing the same for the last 26 years.

Most large drugmakers issued conservative guidance for 2023, which suggests there might be upward revisions as the year progresses. After a pandemic-driven 2020 and 2021, the sector had a brutal 2022 with declining valuations of stocks and a slowing of new drug approvals.However, the sector is poised to be back on track. In 2023, even if the United States enters a recession, the sector is expected to perform well as demand for its products is not affected by a recession.Overall, innovation is likely to drive growth in the industry in 2023. M&amp;A deals are also picking up, which shows growth. Among the large drugmakers, J&amp;J, Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Sanofi are worth retaining in your portfolio.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology, and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products.All these players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies and these large drug makers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are another key feature of large drug companiesStory continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the Large-Cap Pharma Industry?Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drug makers, innovation in their pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spending a significantly high portion of their revenues on R&amp;D.  Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.Aggressive M&amp;A &amp; Collaboration Activity:  The sector is characterized by aggressive M&amp;A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.Also, the sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices, and the emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google in the healthcare industry whet the M&amp;A appetite of large drug makers.The fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&amp;A activities.Also, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing. The year 2023 has begun with some big acquisition announcements. Amgen’s offered to buy Horizon Therapeutics for$27.8 billion in December 2022.Pipeline Setbacks &amp; Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments and a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs.Macroeconomic Uncertainty: The pandemic hurt demand trends of physician-administered drugs of most companies. Though trends recovered in 2021, infection rates shot up significantly in the last quarter of 2021, with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. In 2022, major waves of variants of concern emerged quickly, became dominant and were superseded by the next variant. There is still uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new variants and continued global surges.Higher interest rates, inflationary pressures from rising energy prices, significant economic volatility, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment and economic volatility.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector.  The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #106, which places it in the top 42% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

IND.227 was sponsored by CCTG, in collaboration with investigators in Italy (co-sponsored by National Cancer Institute of Naples - NCIN), and France (co-sponsored by The French Cooperative Thoracic Intergroup - IFCT); Merck provided KEYTRUDA and support for the trial. At the final analysis of the study, KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to chemotherapy alone in these patients. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in this study was consistent with previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230310005060/en/""Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rapidly progressing cancer that develops in the lining of the lungs and has a poor prognosis,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Patients are in need of new treatments that can improve survival outcomes, and these positive results support the potential of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with the most common form of malignant mesothelioma.""""There have been few treatment advances for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, which can be challenging to treat through surgery and radiation alone,"" said Dr. Quincy Chu, CCTG’s study chair of the IND.227 trial/KEYNOTE-483 trial. ""The results from the trial have the potential to make a difference for patients with this disease who have had limited treatment options available to them.""Story continuesMerck has an extensive clinical development program in lung cancer and is advancing multiple registration-enabling studies, with research directed at earlier stages of disease and novel combinations.About IND.227/KEYNOTE-483IND.227/KEYNOTE-483 is a randomized, open-label, randomized Phase 2/3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02784171) sponsored and conducted by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) in collaboration with National Cancer Institute of Naples (NCIN) and Intergroupe Francophone de Cancérologie Thoracique (IFCT). Support for the trial was provided by Merck. The trial evaluated KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with unresected advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma. The primary endpoint of the study is OS, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 modified for mesothelioma, safety and quality of life. The Phase 3 part of the trial enrolled 440 patients who were randomized to receive:KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for up to 35 cycles) in combination with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 every three weeks for six cycles) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2 every three weeks for six cycles; carboplatin substitution was permitted), orPemetrexed and cisplatin (carboplatin substitution was permitted) alone.About malignant mesotheliomaMalignant mesothelioma is a type of cancer that starts in the linings of certain parts of the body, including the chest, abdomen, heart and testicles. Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 30,000 new cases of malignant mesothelioma diagnosed and more than 26,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. Pleural mesothelioma, which develops in the lining of the lungs, is the most common form of malignant mesothelioma, accounting for about 75% of all cases. Malignant pleural mesothelioma often progresses rapidly, and the five-year survival rate is only 12%. Although incidence of malignant mesothelioma has gradually declined in the United States, continued use of and exposure to asbestos around the world has resulted in increasing global rates of this aggressive disease.About the Canadian Cancer Trials GroupThe Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) is a cancer clinical trials research cooperative that runs phase I-III trials to test anti-cancer and supportive therapies at over 85 hospitals and cancer centres across Canada. From their operations centre at Queen's University, CCTG has supported more than 600 trials enrolling 100,000 patients from 40 countries on 6 continents through a global network of 20,000 investigators and clinical trial staff. CCTG is a national program of the Canadian Cancer Society and their aim is to improve survival and quality of life for all people with cancer. CCTG IND.227 was supported by a grant from the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS) (707213). For further information, please visit the CCTG website: www.cctg.ca.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

158,08cb4bc9-a1d3-3709-8389-d3fa3219903a,MOS,2023-03-10,Is It Time To Consider Buying The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-mosaic-company-115150246.html,1678449110,STORY,['MOS'],"[Let's talk about the popular The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Mosaic’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic What's The Opportunity In Mosaic?Great news for investors – Mosaic is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 4.93x is currently well-below the industry average of 12.83x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. However, given that Mosaic’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Mosaic generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Mosaic, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although MOS is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to MOS, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MOS for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.If you'd like to know more about Mosaic as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Mosaic (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.If you are no longer interested in Mosaic, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Morgan likes these 2 top dividend stocks yielding as high as 13% — they’re attractively valued and provide growth upside to boot,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-p-morgan-likes-2-150528023.html,1678374328,STORY,['WMB'],"[Spring is coming up , and investors will need to break out the crystal ball when looking at the market conditions. There’s a growing consensus that even though inflation is down from last summer’s peak, it has plateaued at a high level.Watching the situation from banking giant JPMorgan, CEO Jamie Dimon takes the view that we won’t be getting back to the Fed target of 2% any time soon.Furthermore, while Dimon hails an economy that is “doing quite well” with plenty of jobs to go round, he also stresses that there are plenty of uncertainties to consider. Or as Dimon succinctly puts it, “Russia, Ukraine, oil, gas, war, migration, trade, China” are all potential headwinds. “Out in front of us, there’s some scary stuff. And you and I know there’s always uncertainty,” he warned.The standard play for investors to cope with this sort of uncertainty is to take a strong defensive portfolio position – and that will naturally bring us to look at the high-yield dividend stocks. These are the reliable payers that will give shareholders plenty of defensive attributes: a steady income stream, reliable payments, and inflation-beating yields.So, let’s take a look at two stocks JPMorgan’s analysts have tagged as ones to favor in today’s climate. These are both Buy-rated stocks, with high dividend yields – over 13%, in one case. Here are the details.AGNC Investment (AGNC)We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT). These companies have long been known as true dividend champions, and JPM’s pick, AGNC Investment, has long been known for its high-yielding payments. The company operates in the mortgage-backed security (MBS) niche of the REIT world, holding a portfolio totaling $59.5 billion in securities. That total includes $39.5 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities, and another $18.6 billion in net TBA (to-be-announced) positions. The largest part of AGNC’s portfolio, some 92%, is in 30-year fixed mortgage instruments.Story continuesThe quality of the portfolio can be judged from the recent 4Q22 results. At the bottom line, the company realized net income per common share of 93 cents, some distance above the 66-cent forecast. In addition to solid earnings, the company had $4.3 billion in cash assets as of December 31, 2022. This total represented 59% of AGNC’s total equity.For defensive-minded dividend investors, however, this company’s dividend payment is the real news. AGNC pays out monthly rather than quarterly, giving shareholders a more frequent payment schedule. The dividend, at 12 cents per common share annualizes to $1.44 per share and gives a powerful yield of 13.3%. That beats the last reported inflation data – 6.4% annualized in January – by 6.9 points, ensuring that shareholders won’t just have a reliable real rate of return, but that the return will be substantial.JPMorgan 5-star analyst Richard Shane covers AGNC, and in his most recent note saw fit to upgrade the stock’s rating from Neutral to Overweight (i.e. Buy). Backing his stance, Shane wrote: “We expect AGNC’s primarily Agency MBS portfolio to drive book value recovery as MBS prices recover and offer investors credit protection in a deteriorating economic environment. AGNC’s earnings fully cover its dividend and offer an attractive yield. AGNC is one of the best-managed MREITs within our coverage universe. In our view, being internally managed represents a long-term value driver.”Putting some numbers to this, Shane gives AGNC shares a $12.50 price target, suggesting a one-year upside potential of ~16%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~29% potential total return profile. (To watch Shane’s track record, click here)Overall, with 9 recent analyst reviews on record, breaking down 6 to 3 in favor of Buy over Hold, AGNC shares get a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. (See AGNC stock forecast)The Williams Companies (WMB)For the second high-yield dividend pick, we’ll shift our gaze from REITs to energy. Williams Companies works in the US natural gas industry, operating a network of transport pipelines, gathering and storage facilities, and processing plants for natural gas. The company’s network is centered along the Texas-Louisiana coastline, extends into the Gulf of Mexico, and spreads out to Florida, the Mid-Atlantic and Appalachia, and northwest to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. Approximately 30% of the natural gas used daily in the US passes through Williams’ network.The company recently released its results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, Williams reported revenues of $10.9 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in 2021. From this, the company realized a net income of $2.04 billion, or a diluted EPS of $1.67. Drilling down to the quarterly level, the net income came to $668 million, or 55 cents per share. In non-GAAP adjusted terms, this gave a net income of $653 million, for a non-GAAP diluted EPS of 53 cents – that figure beat the forecast by 3 cents and was up almost 36% year-over-year.It was also enough to guarantee full funding of the firm’s common share dividend, which in the January declaration was raised by 5.3%. The new payment, scheduled to be sent out this coming March 27, now stands at $0.4475 per common share. With an annualized rate of $1.79 per common share, the newly raised dividend yields a shade under 6%. While slightly lower than the current inflation numbers, the Williams’ dividend is still approximately triple the average payment found among S&amp;P-listed div payers – and better yet, Williams has a rock-solid reputation for dividend reliability, having kept up its payments every quarter since 1974.JPMorgan analyst Jeremy Tonet follows Williams Companies, and he likes what he sees. Tonet believes that Williams is one of the best-positioned natural gas companies, and writes: “WMB’s premiere existing ‘steel in the ground’ footprint provides clear competitive advantages to execute the company’s wellhead to market strategy… While current natgas S/D dynamics drives fears of rig drops and shut-ins to balance the market, we see the next leg of LNG demand balancing the market over the next one to two years, supporting an eventual uptick in natgas production levels. As such, with the potential for mid-single digit EBITDA CAGR, YE22 leverage sitting at 3.55x, and a peer leading ESG track record, we see a constructive backdrop over time, with the current ~6% yield providing support.”Tracking his stance forward, Tonet gives WMB shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating and sets his price target at $36, implying an upside of ~18% on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here)Overall, WMB gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Street’s analyst consensus, based on 13 recent reviews that include 8 to Buy against 5 to Hold.

""After the pandemic and the Boeing deal, 2021 and 2022 were years of recovery. From 2023 onwards we will have years of growth.""Shares in Embraer jumped more than 7% after the news, making it one of the top gainers on Brazil's Bovespa stock index, as markets also welcomed strong fourth quarter metrics despite adjusted net profit sliding 24.5% to $43.2 million.""We expect a positive reaction due to strong EBITDA margin and higher than expected free cash flow,"" JPMorgan analysts said. ""Moreover, 2023 guidance bring upside to consensus figures"".Embraer had already disclosed deliveries of 159 aircraft in 2022, meeting the target for executive jets but falling just short of its previous outlook for commercial jets.Last year was marked by deliveries concentrated in the fourth quarter and supply chain disruptions, which Gomes Neto expects to improve in 2023 but only fully normalize next year.In 2023, Embraer said, its commercial aircraft unit is forecast to deliver from 65 to 70 jets, up from 57 last year, with sales also set for a strong performance as travel rebounds post-pandemic, restoring the firm's backlog to its pre-2020 level.Story continuesRecent deals include a firm order for six E195-E2 jets signed with Oman's low-cost carrier SalamAir, as well as a deal for 20 aircraft with Canada's Porter Airlines, an order of 15 E195-E2 from an undisclosed customer and a new order of five jets from Spanish carrier Binter.""I haven't seen a (sales) pipeline as strong as the current one for a long time,"" Gomes Neto said, adding he expects another busy fourth quarter for the company this year as some supply issues are still in sight.Executive jet deliveries, meanwhile, are seen jumping as much as 27.5% to a level between 120 and 130, the firm said.Embraer also maintained for this year its forecast of a free cash flow of $150 million or more. Last year, Embraer started with an estimate of $50 million or better but ultimately zoomed to a $540 million total.""We had a lot of challenges in 2022 - the war in Ukraine, inflation, supply chain constraints. But we delivered basically every guidance,"" Gomes Neto said. ""Free cash flow was the cherry on the cake"".(Reporting by Gabriel Araujo; Editing by Steven Grattan)]"

173,8c1c7108-48da-3c6f-b257-72f0c0bd6fbc,NOC,2023-03-10,General Dynamics (GD) Announces a Hike of 4.8% in Dividend,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-gd-announces-hike-142202022.html,1678371722,STORY,"['GD', 'LMT', 'LHX', 'NOC']","[General Dynamics Corporation GD recently announced that its board of directors approved a hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.32 per share, up 4.8% from the prior payout.With the current hike, the company will now pay out an annual dividend of $5.28 per share. This represents an annual dividend yield of 2.33% based on its share price worth as of Mar 8. The annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s yield of 1.59%.This signifies General Dynamics’s strength in business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payoutWill General Dynamics Sustain Dividend Hikes?The increase in the dividend payout is backed by strength in the business, which enables the company to register growth in earnings and sales. Hence, it is imperative to mention that General Dynamics recorded a 5.6% increase in its earnings in the last reported quarter, while sales recorded a growth rate of 5.4% from the previous year’s reported figure. Such improvement in numbers must have triggered the hike in the dividend payout for shareholders.Also, the ability to distribute excess cash to shareholders is underpinned by a company’s strategy and strong cash flow position. In this context, it is imperative to mention that the company recorded a growth of 7.2% in cash flow from operating activities, while its free cash flow registered an increase of 2.4% in 2022. Such enhancement in cash positions complements a company’s intent to increase dividends for shareholders.General Dynamics’ backlog strength also plays a significant role in accomplishing the objectives of its business and supporting such dividend payouts. It recorded a total backlog of $91.10 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 2.6% from third-quarter 2022’s backlog of $88.80 billion.All the aforementioned factors collectively enabled the company to consistently increase dividends for its shareholders. The company paid a total dividend of $1.4 billion in 2022, compared with $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. General Dynamics’ has a long history of increasing annual dividends and has been doing the same for the last 26 years. The company repurchased 5.3 million of our outstanding shares for $1.2 billion in 2022 while it has 6.7 million remains in its authorization to be repurchased.Story continuesCourtesy of the strong fundamentals and stable demand for its products, General Dynamics may continue to reward shareholders with more impressive dividend hikes as well as share repurchase activity.Peer MovesDefense companies generally have long-term contracts with government entities which ensures stable income and cash flow. They tend to have a strong financial position, which allows them to reward shareholders with either share repurchase activity or dividend hikes. , Apart from General Dynamics, other defense players that have been engaged in shareholder-friendly moves are:In February 2023, L3Harris Technologies LHX approved a hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.14 per share, up 1.8% from the prior payout.L3Harris boasts a long-term (three-five) earnings growth rate of 2.6%.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nike (NKE) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.58 a share, just 12 days from its upcoming earnings release on March 21, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.58 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.50 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nike has an Earnings ESP of 15.69%.NKE is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. Whirlpool (WHR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on April 24, 2023, Whirlpool holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.10 a share 46 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Whirlpool is $1.99, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 5.53%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NKE and WHR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

As NASA’s website states, “[t]here is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Further, human activity represents the principal catalyst. Fortunately, several public enterprises have stepped up to the plate, ready to deliver tangible solutions.A major component of the underlying proposals centers on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. To be sure, mentioning ESG can spark political disagreements. However, because younger generations tend to be progressive about sustainability concerns, targeting stocks to buy based on climate change-related matters may be astute. After all, they represent the future. Finally, with overwhelming consensus among scientists that climate change represents a genuine phenomenon, the trend is clear. With that, these are the stocks to buy amid the environmental crisis.KKellogg$65.10NKENike$120.17LOWLowe’s$201.57JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$155.56CCJCameco$27.27BEPBrookfield Renewable$27.31GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$95.58InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBreakfast favorite Kellogg (NYSE:K) might not seem like an intuitive example of stocks to buy for the climate change crisis. However, the food stalwart made significant investments into plant-based meat, specifically through its Incogmeato brand. Although millennials have gravitated toward plant-based alternatives, fake meat providers largely struggle in this space. Fundamentally, they lack the scale to succeed.On the other hand, Incogmeato enjoys the support of parent Kellogg, which makes its foray into non-animal proteins possibly viable. For investors, K stock represents a slow-and-steady vehicle, with a return of over 1% in the trailing year. However, since the January opener, it slipped by 8%. Despite the challenges, it could make for a contrarian idea. Primarily, Kellogg benefits from decent profitability. For instance, its net margin pings at 6.27%, outpacing 68% of the competition.Story continuesFurther, while Wall Street analysts peg K as a consensus hold, their average price target stands at $71.80. This implies over 9% upside potential, making Kellogg a respectable idea for stocks to buy.Nike (NKE)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comOn the surface, Nike (NYSE:NKE) not only doesn’t seem like one of the stocks to buy for climate change, but some critics might also blast the athletic apparel giant for contributing to it. While Nike produces clothing – an essential item – the center of its product is on discretionary behavior. In other words, it’s a bit superfluous.Nevertheless, Nike enjoys serious cred about climate-change-addressing stocks to buy. For instance, LeafScore notes that Nike launched a “Move to Zero” initiative. Under this plan, management will aim to reduce carbon emissions by 30% across its entire supply chain by 2030. Further, the company implemented the Nike Grind recycling program, which involves converting used footwear into new shoes. This program also repurposes surplus manufacturing materials to make apparel and equipment.Two attributes stand out for Nike: stability in the balance sheet and excellent profit margins. They undoubtedly contributed to Wall Street analysts pegging NKE as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $131.33, implying nearly 10% upside potential.Lowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comIn many ways, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) may be one of the most cynical stocks to buy for the climate change crisis. Generally speaking, natural disasters tend to boost sales for home-improvement retailers. By that, I’m referring to more manageable storms and inclement weather events. As people prepare for an incoming incident, critical goods start flying out the door.Now, should climate change worsen over time, it’s quite possible that the frequency of inclement weather events could likewise rise. Moreover, we don’t need to focus just on disasters. For instance, unusual heat waves can spark sales of portable air conditioner units and fans.Intriguingly, Gurufocus.com’s analysis of Lowe’s discounted cash flow (DCF) reveals that its shares ping as considerably undervalued. As well, the company enjoys strong operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.2% while its operating margin hit nearly 11%. Both stats rate well into the underlying sector’s upper echelon. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg LOW as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $228.73, implying over 17% upside potential.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockKnown the world over for its over-the-counter medicines and various household items, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also makes a strong case for stocks to buy amid the climate change crisis. Per LeafScore, the company pledges to do its part for the plant, committing to sustainable packaging. This means the material used will be recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025.Further, the healthcare giant’s facilities currently run on 35% renewable energy. However, the company plans to bring this percentage to 100% by 2050. Beyond this, the company generated a positive reputation for its environmental activism. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), JNJ rates as modestly undervalued. The company’s top financial attributes center on its operations. For instance, its three-year book growth rate pings at 9.2%, above 60% of rivals. And its net margin is 18.9%, above nearly 87% of the industry.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg JNJ as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $183.10, implying 20% upside potential.Cameco (CCJ)periodic table concept with black cubes. uranium element is glowingSource: ShutterstockAt first glance, the mentioning of uranium specialist Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) may strike one as an odd inclusion for stocks to buy in the climate change category. However, the stereotypes of nuclear meltdowns and subsequent fallouts represent more Hollywood fiction than reality. True, these circumstances invariably represent risk factors tied to nuclear energy. However, on balance, nuclear disasters are thankfully rare.More importantly, no one can ignore the relevancies associated with Cameco’s underlying industry. From an emissions standpoint, nuclear power produces zero carbon emissions. It also doesn’t produce other noxious greenhouse gases through its operations. Additionally, nuclear energy features astounding energy density. For instance, one uranium fuel pellet creates as much energy as 149 gallons of crude oil. Not surprisingly, analysts peg CCJ as one of the stocks to buy – a strong buy view to be precise. Further, their average price target stands at $35.95, implying over 29% upside potential.Brookfield Renewable (BEP)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb conceptSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comStructured as a publicly traded limited partnership, Brookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEP) owns and operates renewable power assets. As such, BEP represents one of the direct players among stocks to buy for the climate change issue. According to its public profile, Brookfield owned at the end of 2017 over 200 hydroelectric plants, 100 wind farms, over 550 solar facilities, and four storage facilities.While BEP sounds incredibly relevant, investors will require patience as it’s on the riskier side. True, BEP did gain over 3% since the Jan. opener. However, in the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 27% of equity value. Still, it could be an interesting market idea for speculative contrarians. Financially, its greatest strengths lie in its top-line operations. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.6%, outpacing 72% of the field. As well, the market prices BEP at a sales multiple of 1.65. As a discount to revenue, the company ranks better than 62.3% of the underlying sector.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg BEP as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $35.83, implying nearly 34% upside potential.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAs the dominant force behind the internet, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has no equal. But as one of the stocks to buy amid the climate change crisis? You might be thinking that several other superior options exist. However, according to LeafScore, Alphabet ranks top for publicly traded companies fighting climate change in 2023.Notably, the company became carbon neutral in 2007. A decade later, it became the first company of its size to match its total electricity consumption with renewable energy. Further, Alphabet ranks as the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy. This includes more than 50 projects totaling 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects under contract worldwide.Impressively, LeafScore notes that these renewable projects account for an annual deficit of approximately 5 million tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg GOOG as a consensus strong buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $123.78, implying 34% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world.In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.""The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times.""Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge.""SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday.This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%.Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday.Story continuesFirst Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session.As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good.Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning.The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data.""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly.""The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell testifies before a House Financial Services hearing on ""The Federal Reserve's Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 8, 2023. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueStocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation.""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro.""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month.Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week.Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve.In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base.

""Estoy muy orgulloso de ser parte de una comunidad que está haciendo una inversión seria para apoyar a los propietarios de pequeñas empresas de habla hispana como yo.""While there was an outpouring of support for so many marginalized small business owners during Covid-19, the significant majority of the resources made available were in English. It became increasingly clear that the most pressing product priority for Silver Lining, and the community of business owners it supports, was not to add the next set of features into the program but to ensure that the program was fully available in Spanish to help the 4.4+ million Spanish-speaking small business owners in the US who face many challenges but have limited support in their language.Story continues""According to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the approximately 4.4 million Spanish-speaking SMBs in the United States contribute more than $700 billion to the American economy every year. It is a true testament to the resilience and creativity of these business owners to know that they accomplish so much with so few resources available to them. It is an honor to know that we have created something that can give them access to more structure and support so that they can increase their success. When Spanish-speaking small business owners succeed, so do our communities and the economy. "" says Carissa Reiniger, Silver Lining's Founder &amp; CEO.The launch of SLAP in Spanish is one element of the larger American Small Business Growth Program which is a multi-pronged program focused on changing the US-economy one small business at a time. The program has brought the SLAP™ Program to over 700 US-based small business owners from marginalized communities in addition to implementing multiple innovation projects and public engagement campaigns to address larger systemic issues that face diverse and underserved small businesses. Launching SLAP in Spanish was a major objective of the first phase of the American Small Business Growth Program and thanks to the catalytic capital from Wells Fargo, Silver Lining has gone through a comprehensive process to translate all elements of the SLAP experience and build the infrastructure to not just make SLAP available in Spanish, but to more easily and efficiently release SLAP in additional languages in the future.""Having access to a trusted expert in business and financial planning can be a game-changer for a small business owner,"" said Jenny Flores, head of small business growth philanthropy at Wells Fargo. ""At Wells Fargo, we're working to expand the capacity of organizations like Silver Lining to reach more entrepreneurs and accelerate their growth.""Thanks to additional support from Wells Fargo, the first 100 Spanish-speaking small business owners who apply for a spot in the American Small Business Growth Program will get the full program, valued at over $5,000 USD, at a Pay-What-You-Can rate. Organizations that support Spanish-speaking SMBs and small business owners are encouraged to apply now for these spots.To learn more about The American Small Business Growth Program, please visit: https://smallbizsilverlining.com/wellsfargoAbout Silver LiningSince 2005, Silver Lining has been helping small business owners worldwide build more proﬁtable and sustainable businesses through their proprietary tech-enabled and data-driven small business growth program - SLAP™ - the Silver Lining Action Plan.

Pfizer gained the drug as well as FDA-approved oral migraine pill Nurtec ODT, through its $11.6 billion buyout of Biohaven Pharmaceutical last year.Pfizer has forecast peak sales from its migraine pipeline to be around $6 billion.Zavzpret, to be launched in July, would be comparable in price to other FDA-approved migraine medicines that belong to the same class of drugs, Pfizer told Reuters.The drug, also known as zavegepant, will be competing with rivals from AbbVie Inc, Eli Lilly and Co, Amgen Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical that are also calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors.""The (Pfizer) drug has two main advantages over the older CGRP antagonists: it is safe for people with cardiovascular risk factors, and second, it does not cause medication overuse headache,"" said Dr Emad Estemalik, psychiatrist at Cleveland Clinic.A nasal spray would also benefit patients who are unable to swallow a pill, Estemalik said.Pfizer is hoping to gain a competitive edge in the migraine drug category with Zavzpret, which Biohaven has called the ""Epipen of migraine"", for its quick action.Zavzpret's approval was based on late-stage study data that showed the drug was superior in 13 of 17 goals when compared to placebo, including pain relief in 15 minutes and normal function at 30 minutes.About 39 million people in the United States suffer from migraine, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.Pfizer's shares were marginally up at $39.75 in noon trading.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ZAVZPRET™ (zavegepant), the first and only calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. In its pivotal Phase 3 study, ZAVZPRET was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours post-dose. The pivotal study also demonstrated pain relief as early as 15 minutes in a prespecified secondary endpoint versus placebo.""The FDA approval of ZAVZPRET marks a significant breakthrough for people with migraine who need freedom from pain and prefer alternative options to oral medications,"" said Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer, President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer. ""ZAVZPRET underscores Pfizer’s commitment to delivering an additional treatment option to help people with migraine gain relief and get back to their daily lives. Pfizer will continue to build its migraine franchise to further support the billions of people worldwide impacted by this debilitating disease.""The FDA approval is based on two pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that established the efficacy, tolerability and safety profiles of ZAVZPRET for the acute treatment of migraine. In these studies, ZAVZPRET was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (defined as a reduction of moderate or severe headache pain to no headache pain) and freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours post-dose (defined as the absence of the self-identified most bothersome symptom). The pivotal Phase 3 study published in The Lancet Neurology found ZAVZPRET showed broad efficacy by also demonstrating statistically significant superiority to placebo across 13 of 17 prespecified secondary outcome measures, including early time point endpoints (e.g., 15 and 30-minute pain relief and return to normal function at 30 minutes), return to normal function at 2 hours, and durable efficacy endpoints (e.g., 2-24 and 2-48 hour sustained pain freedom and sustained pain relief). On the 14th endpoint, return to normal function at 15 minutes post-dose, the difference between ZAVZPRET and placebo was not significant. Consequently, in keeping with the trial’s statistical analysis plan, the remaining secondary endpoints were not formally tested.Story continues""When a migraine hits, it has a significant negative impact on a person’s daily life,"" said Kathleen Mullin, M.D., Associate Medical Director at New England Institute for Neurology &amp; Headache. ""Among my migraine patients, one of the most important attributes of an acute treatment option is how quickly it works. As a nasal spray with rapid drug absorption, ZAVZPRET offers an alternative treatment option for people who need pain relief or cannot take oral medications due to nausea or vomiting, so they can get back to normal function quickly.""ZAVZPRET was well tolerated in clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients treated with ZAVZPRET and at a frequency greater than placebo were taste disorders (includes dysgeusia and ageusia), nausea, nasal discomfort and vomiting. ZAVZPRET is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to zavegepant or to any of its components. Hypersensitivity reactions, including facial swelling and urticaria, have occurred with ZAVZPRET in clinical studies.ZAVZPRET is anticipated to be available in pharmacies in July 2023.About MigraineNearly 40 million people in the United States suffer from migraine1 and the World Health Organization classifies migraine as the second leading cause of disability in the world.2 Migraine is characterized by debilitating attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity often associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia).3About CGRP Receptor AntagonismSmall molecule CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of migraine. For acute treatment, this unique mode of action offers an alternative to other agents, including those patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have a poor response to triptans or are intolerant to them. CGRP signal-blocking therapies have not been associated with medication overuse headache (MOH) or rebound headache, which can limit the clinical utility of other acute treatments.About ZAVZPRETZavegepant is a third generation, high affinity, selective and structurally unique, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist and the only CGRP receptor antagonist in clinical development with both intranasal and oral formulations.INDICATIONZAVZPRET™ (zavegepant) is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.Limitations of Use: ZAVZPRET is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONContraindications: Hypersensitivity to ZAVZPRET or any of its components.Warnings and Precautions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including facial swelling and urticaria, have occurred with ZAVZPRET. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ZAVZPRET and initiate appropriate therapy.Adverse Reactions: Most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥2% of patients treated with ZAVZPRET and greater than placebo) for ZAVZPRET vs placebo were taste disorders including dysgeusia and ageusia (18% vs 4%), nausea (4% vs 1%), nasal discomfort (3% vs 1%), and vomiting (2% vs 1%).Drug Interactions: Avoid use with drugs that inhibit or induce OATP1B3 or NTCP transporters. Avoid use of intranasal decongestants; if unavoidable, administer intranasal decongestants at least 1 hour after ZAVZPRET administration.Use in Specific Populations: Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Renal impairment: Avoid use of ZAVZPRET in patients with creatine clearance (CLcr) less than 30 mL/min.Please click here for full Prescribing Information.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

A second ex-executive was acquitted.A Brooklyn federal jury deliberated four days before returning the verdicts. Hernan Lopez, the former CEO of Fox International Channels, was convicted. Carlos Martinez, who headed the Latin America affiliate, was acquitted.Prosecutors said the case revealed the corruption of international soccer. Defense lawyers said the former Fox execs were framed by an admitted criminal who was trying to minimize his own punishment.An emotional Lopez hugged supporters in the courtroom after hearing the verdict, while his attorneys appeared stunned. The judge allowed him to be released on bail pending sentencing.John Gleeson, an attorney for Lopez, asserted there were “legal and factual errors.""“We look forward to vindicating our client on appeal,” he said.Martinez's lawyer, Steve McCool, said “justice was served today for Carlos.""""The jurors heard that he was an innocent man, and that he should never have been here in the first place,” McCool said outside court.A South American sports media and marketing company also was convicted of graft allegations — involving different TV rights. Full Play Group SA, incorporated in Uruguay, was accused of paying bribes for the rights to the Copa America, a quadrennial national team competition, as well as to World Cup qualifying matches.New York-based Fox Corp., which split from a subsidiary of international channels during a restructuring in 2019, was not charged and has denied any involvement in the bribery scandal.Lopez and Martinez are among dozens of people who have pleaded guilty or been convicted after a U.S.-led investigation into international soccer and its governing federation, FIFA. The probe burst into view in 2015, when U.S. prosecutors accused the leaders of soccer federations of tarnishing the sport for nearly a quarter century by taking $150 million in bribes and payoffs.Story continuesFIFA went on to expand and rename its executive leadership group. Then-President Sepp Blatter was forced out and replaced by current President Gianni Infantino, who has insisted the organization has reformed. However, it has in recent years been criticized for tolerating alleged abuse of migrant workers during the construction of World Cup stadiums used in Qatar last year and of maintaining inferior payments and tournament arrangements for women players.In the Lopez and Martinez case, prosecutors’ star witness was the executives’ former business associate Alejandro Burzaco. He has cooperated in soccer corruption investigations since his 2015 arrest in a related bribery case.During 11 days on the witness stand, Burzaco said he and the two executives paid millions of dollars in bribes to undermine competing bids for the TV rights to the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest annual tournament, the Copa Libertadores, and help land broadcasting rights to the sport’s most lucrative competition, the World Cup.Two jurors who agreed to speak after the trial said Burzaco was not a factor in their decisions.“We didn’t find him credible,” said one of the jurors, Robert Rose, who works as an attorney.Instead jurors relied on reams of documents presented during the case.Rose said “it wasn't tough” to convict Lopez, and jurors wrestled over reaching a verdict for Martinez. In the end, Rose said, “there was enough doubt.”Defense lawyers said Burzaco lied about the former Fox executives to minimize his own conduct and curry favor with the government ahead of his own sentencing. He pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges.Prosecutors allege the payoffs yielded confidential information from high-ranking soccer officials, including those at FIFA, that enabled Fox to beat out rival ESPN and secure U.S. broadcasting rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.___Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington and Jennifer Peltz in New York contributed.]"

Throughout the two-hour documentary, viewers will hear first-hand accounts from Hall and those who were integral to his rescue and recovery, including with his wife Alicia Meller, Zakrzewski’s widow Michelle Ross-Stanton, best friend Rick Findler, FOX News correspondents Jennifer Griffin, Trey Yingst, and Greg Palkot, Save Our Allies co-founder Sarah Verardo, a number of doctors and surgeons who helped him, among others.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:8.1% = US$1.8b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (16%) in the IT industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 5 risks we have identified for International Business Machines visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining International Business Machines' Debt And Its 8.1% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by International Business Machines, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.30. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 5.2% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MPC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 15.3% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MPC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.6. This indicates that the stock moves 60% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that MPC has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MPC earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MPC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MPC is currently trading at 0.32 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 32 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MPC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MPC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

GM is looking to trim its employee count here. This time the automaker is offering buyouts to the majority of its salaried workers as part of its plan to cut $2 billion in costs over the next two years. Let's take a look at shares of GM. They're off just about 4 and 1/2%. That's because GM expects to take a pre-tax charge of up to 1 and 1/2 billion on the move. And, of course, the broader markets under pressure today as well. We want to bring in Tom Narayan. He's RBC Capital Markets lead equity analyst for global autos. Tom, it's great to have you here. So starting with GM, the move from Mary Barra, what do you think of it?TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. I mean, this was expected. It was part of their cost cutting plan to begin with. So I don't think it was really out of the ordinary. Really, when you look at the auto industry, everyone is worried about profit margins. We're at peak pricing levels, peak margin levels. So everyone's worried that pricing falls. This is a way to absorb some of those pricing corrections. New car pricing and mix is definitely going to have to come back because semis and chips are coming back. So now they're going to put chips in probably lower mix, lower priced cars. So by cutting these casts, which were always the plan to begin with, it can absorb some of that hit from pricing and mix coming down.- How do you evaluate GM's transition to EVs? Are they anywhere near the bumper of Tesla as we transition to the Tesla conversation? But how close is GM?TOM NARAYAN: I mean, it's a little bit of apples and oranges. So GM is predominantly in North America where, arguably, you don't need this huge ramp of electrification as quick as, let's say, you need in Europe because of CO2 compliance. So GM also has pickup trucks, which is such a great business. You don't really need to electrify those as quickly, even though they are. So it's really hard to compare the two. One is a clean sheet EV company. The other one is transitioning from ICTVs. But even so, I think GM is doing the right things. They're vertically integrated with their Ultium battery cells, doing that in house. There's only two other folks doing that. It's Tesla and Volkswagen and GM.Story continues- Tom, let's talk a little bit more about Tesla because Cathie Wood, who's been bullish on Tesla now for quite some time, scooping up even more shares of the automaker. When it comes to the outperformance as of late of Tesla, we know that there's some concerns out there about the ongoing investigations, most recently being the steering wheel that could fall off of a Model Y. How worried are you about that in terms of what that means for Tesla's investor story going forward?TOM NARAYAN: I mean, this is par for the course for Tesla. There's always news and headlines like this. At the end of the day, I think people who invest in Tesla, they understand these issues. And they really look at Tesla as the ability to disintermediate the entire market. It really reminds me of what Netflix did to the media industry a decade ago, coming in and completely upending the industry, cutting costs significantly. They don't advertise. The average cost of a car-- something like $5,000, $6,000 of a car is advertising. They don't use dealers. That's about 1,400 bucks off that. They found ways to cut costs in the manufacturing process. This is what investors really care about.Definitely, there's news items that will hit the stock every now and then. But its core investor base is really about the future of this company and how they can cut costs and effectively undercut the rest of the market and their clean sheet approach. It's the only EV company, pure play EV company, that's actually seen its stock rise in recent months. And I think that's why investors are looking at EVs and they're saying, this is the clear winner. And they're choosing it over a lot of other new EV makers.- You've got an outperform on a $223 price target on Tesla. It feels like a month ago, but I think it was just a week ago, investor day, when the perception was, meh. They did not give details about a low cost Tesla. And it was a long four hour drown out talk about the sustainability of the planet. Net impact on the stock?TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. I think that's maybe an unfair characterization. It was immediately my characterization as well.- Panned widely.TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. Yeah. When you rewatch it over and over again after, its like--- You didn't do that to yourself, did you?TOM NARAYAN: Yes, I did.- Wow.TOM NARAYAN: Yeah.- It's a long one too.TOM NARAYAN: It's one of those where you have to like-- what is that movie, like ""Memento,"" where you have to watch it a few times to really get it. And you do that, and you realize if you read between the lines, he is saying there's going to be a $25,000 car because he's saying 20 million cars per year. It's his target. I don't think he's going to get there.- Which is nonsense, right?TOM NARAYAN: It's nonesene. But the fact that he's putting that out there, you're not going to get there with Model 3's and Model Y. It's just too expensive. He even said as much. And he had a chart which had a car with the nice blanket over it that had a big number on it in one of the slides. I think that's going to be the $25,000 car. That's going to have huge implications on the rest of the industry, especially for the things I said earlier. He can come in, undercut the rest of the market.And this could be a global vehicle. It's not just penetrating the US. Now you can go after Europe, of course, China. So I actually think when you really dive into the details, ability to cut costs on chips, right, the silicon carbide by 75%. Overall manufacturing, you showed how you can change the way you make the car and cut the cost in general by 50%. I actually don't think that it was as negative. And I think people can rewatch it and come to the conclusion, yeah, a $25,000 car is coming.- And that would be a huge one here for Tesla going forward. What about the Cybertruck? There's lots of debate out there about how much impact that's going to have, how meaningful that will be for Tesla over the next several years. What do you think?TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. I think he was underplayed a bit during the event, also with the Optimus robot as well. So I would agree that's probably not as emphasized as it was in the past. To me, the big takeaway from this event, $25,000 car. Not really so much Cybertruck. But I don't think you really need Cybertruck for the stock to work. It's really about upending the entire EV ecosystem.- So real quickly, that's kind of a specialty, you believe, as opposed to those who feel it's going to be mainstream and you change the entire industry. You believe this is more the Ferrari model, as some have called it.TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. It's probably more like the Model X and Model S. Those are pretty low volume cars. I'm not saying Cybertruck will be low volume. It has a ton of orders. But I just don't think you need that to work for Tesla stock to work. Again, this $25,000 car is going to be game changing. Also, Model 3 and Model Y have a lot of runway ahead.- Those are the catalysts up ahead. All right. Tom Narayan, great to have you. Thanks so much.

With the global shortage of semiconductors still crimping U.S auto production, General Motors has signed a deal with chip maker GlobalFoundries to dedicate part of an upstate New York factory to supply the automaker, according to a joint statement from the companies Thursday, Feb. 9, 2023. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)In an 8-K filing submitted by GM on Thursday, the automaker says it expects to take a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge, and up to $300 million in pre-tax, non-cash pension curtailment charges. GM said the majority of the charges would likely be incurred in the first half of 2023.GM says its instituting this Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in order to ""accelerate fixed cost reduction efforts"" which include efforts like reducing vehicle complexity, expanding use of shared subsystems between gas-powered cars and future EVs, and decreasing discretionary spending, among other things.Only a few weeks back GM initiated performance-based job cuts, which the company made clear to say did not amount to layoffs, for 500 salaried employees, less than 1% of GM’s 81,000 global salaried workforce.This came after GM reported strong fourth quarter earnings, driven by record revenue. At the time GM was adamant that layoffs where not being considered.Story continues“I want to be clear, we're not considering any layoffs as part of that [$2 billion in cost savings]. We're going to manage headcount through attrition and targeted hiring for our priorities, but making sure that we're monitoring costs so that if we do find ourselves in a situation where pricing weakens or we see softness in the consumer, we can react more quickly,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in an interview with Yahoo Finance following GM’s Q4 earnings release.At the time, GM’s insistence of no planned job cuts was an anomaly given the overall industry at the time. Ford stated it would lay off 3,800 workers in Europe as part of it cost-cutting plan, and Stellantis idled its Jeep Cherokee plant in Belvidere, NJ, leaving 1,350 factory workers permanently furloughed starting on March 1st.GM shares were trading lower in midday trading on Thursday.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

""Now more than ever, we need to have a mindset of taking cost in everything we do.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best EV Stocks To Buy For 2023. The electric vehicle industry has significantly grown in less than a decade since even in the early 2010s, there were few companies - whether established giants or startups - that could successfully mass produce electric cars. However, now, internal combustion car manufacturers such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are acutely aware that if they do not speed up their electric vehicle production, then pretty soon, they will end up losing market share to firms such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) which are selling thousands of electric cars every month. In fact, even the stock market is fully aware of the massive potential of electric vehicles, as Tesla's market capitalization, which sat at $570 billion at the close of market on March 9, 2023, is more than double the value of Ford and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) combined. This is a stunning fact that represents the reality of today's market, especially since General Motors and Ford are iconic American firms that are giants in their own right and have manufactured cars for decades.Boom in the electric vehicle industry is also aided by government spending, particularly in the Western world and in China. The U.S. government passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) last year which promised an eye popping $370 billion in subsidies for renewable energy and climate investments. Specifically for the electric vehicles segment, the IRA promises up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicles that are manufactured in America, and it also boosts companies' incentives to make more electric cars in the U.S. by requiring that 100% of all battery components must be made in North America by 2028 as well as mandating that 80% of all critical materials used in battery manufacturing must either be extracted in North America or in countries with free trade agreements with the U.S. Since the U.S. is one of the biggest car markets in the world, this opens the door to domestic firms and those with U.S. based operations to have a solid footing in the country.Story continuesHowever, Fisher Investments, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, was quick to caution that just because Congress passes laws favoring a certain industry does not mean that the relevant firms' shares will perform well. Citing some previous examples, the hedge fund pointed out:Even the presumption that there are surefire winners from the IRA seems overstated to us. It stems from the basic assumption that government support will bring big success for the relevant companies and industries, vaulting them past competitors (presuming future Congresses don’t redirect the money, which is scheduled to drip out over a decade). But we are old enough to remember the story of Solyndra, a Bay Area solar company backed by the Obama administration over a decade ago. It was supposedly the future, but it went belly up, leaving taxpayers on the hook. An electric vehicle battery plant that received federal funds in 2010 charted a similar course, going from fanfare to furloughs and floundering within two years. Not to point fingers at the Obama administration—pretty much every presidential administration in modern history has made similar foibles. But it is a good reminder that governments don’t always pick winners.While governments might not pick out the winners, hedge funds bet substantive amounts of capital on potential stock market outperformers. Within the electric vehicle market, some of these are Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).12 Best EV Stocks To Buy For 2023david-von-diemar-ZBWn5DvO0hg-unsplashOur Methodology We used Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds covering their Q4 2022 investments to determine which electric vehicle companies - pureplay or otherwise - are their favorites.

He has also attacked a jail guard, she said.Joshua Hanye, Nuzum's court-appointed lawyer, said his client objected to any evaluation. As the hearing ended, Torres shouted as guards led him out of the courtroom: ""I've been renamed Balthazar by God.""In the Christian religion, Balthazar is the name of one of the three wise men who visited the baby Jesus in the Bible.According to prosecutors, about 45 minutes before the flight landed in Boston, the flight crew received an alarm in the cockpit that a door between the first class and coach sections of the plane had been disarmed.After Torres was confronted about whether he tampered with it, he tried to stab a flight attendant in the neck with a broken metal spoon. Passengers then tackled him and the flight crew restrained him.He was charged with one count of interference and attempted interference with flight crew members and attendants using a dangerous weapon and faces up to life in prison if convicted.

Here is what the firm has to say:“”We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Others sell goods that are priced in dollars such as Parker-Hannifin’s (NYSE:PH) aerospace products. Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend Growth.  Suggested articles:14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now10 Mad Money Stock Picks This Week11 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for BeginnersDisclosure.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -4.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -17.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.58 points to a change of +42.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -11.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.57 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Target.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $25.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $111.24 billion and $113.74 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $31.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.3%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $3.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.29%. The EPS surprise was +35.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 132% in five years. In the last week shares have slid back 1.5%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Target To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Target achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.6% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Target's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Target's TSR for the last 5 years was 160%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 6.2% in the twelve months, Target shareholders did even worse, losing 22% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 21%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Target better, we need to consider many other factors.

EPA official,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/people-know-moving-backyards-amid-202525014.html,1678393530,VIDEO,"['CSX', 'NSC']","[Mustafa Santiago Ali, Executive Vice President for the National Wildlife Federation and Former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Official, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss rail safety following multiple high-profile train derailments.Video Transcript- Another Norfolk Southern train derailing this afternoon. This time in Alabama, while the company's CEO Alan Shore testified before the Senate Committee on environment and public works. Today's hearing was intended to discern the impact of last month's disaster on the community of East Palestine, Ohio, a devastating impact according to EPA Regional Administrator Debra Shore. Let's listen.DEBRA SHORE: I've personally been in East Palestine listening to residents and have heard how devastating this derailment has been. They are understandably worried, and some are scared. And every time a train whistle blows, they're reminded of the trauma inflicted upon them by Norfolk Southern. That's why we've used one of EPA's most powerful enforcement tools to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and to require the company to clean up the mess it made.I want to be abundantly clear. The residents of the Greater East Palestine community are not alone. EPA is with them and will continue to be with them for as long as it takes.- With us now to discuss the kinds of hazardous materials being transported on our nation's railways and their effects on the environment is executive vice president of the National Wildlife Federation and former EPA official Mustafa Santiago Ali. Nice to see you, sir. This is a concerning trend.Where do you focus first? Is it with the federal government? Is it with the industry and regulation, or is it with Norfolk Southern?MUSTAFA SANTIAGO ALI: I think we have to do all three simultaneously because we understand that everyone has a role to play. And that if we don't make sure the right regulations are in place, if we don't make sure the right inspections are happening, then we continue to see Norfolk Southern having problems with derailments that are going on. We also have to make sure that the federal government is moving forward to tighten those statutes, those regulations to make sure that people's lives are being protected.Story continuesAnd as we heard earlier, both the mental health and the physical health and then, of course, we also have to pay particular attention also to the wealth that's being lost in communities that are dealing with these hazardous chemical disasters. So we have to make sure that we're doing all three so that we don't leave a gap in the process.SEANA SMITH: And, Mustafa, take a look at some of the chemicals that were traveling on this train, it includes highly toxic chemicals, like vinyl chloride. Talk to us just about the risk that this poses to residents and just how toxic, how dangerous some of these chemicals that are traveling all over the country.MUSTAFA SANTIAGO ALI: Yeah. Well, vinyl chloride has been a lot, you know, in the news, and people have been learning more about it. It can cause trouble breathing, irregular heartbeats, brain, liver, and lung cancer if you have long-term sets of exposures to it.And then when you end up burning, as you saw with the control burn that happened there in East Palestine, you have to deal with things like hydrogen chloride. That can also irritate the skin, the nose, the eyes of throat, the larynx, various things there. But there are also other things that folks haven't talked enough about, like phosgene.Phosgene is also a part burning that often happens. And at low levels, it can be very, very dangerous. It actually smells like hay, for those who've ever been around the cutting of hay, and it's very corrosive to the lungs. It can irritate the eyes, and there's breathing difficulties.So when you hear residents there sharing about some of the impacts that they have going on, it's in alignment with some of the impacts that we know these chemicals can have. And then, of course, dioxin is one of those toxic chemicals that scares everyone. And it's a part of a burning process, and it can literally cause cancer. So we have to listen to what communities are saying. We've got to make sure that the testing continues to happen, to help them to understand any changes that they may be seeing in their health.- Of course, these chemicals have been transported on our nation's rails for as long as there have been around. How much transparency should there be to the towns that they're passing through? And is there any other way, Mustafa, to get these chemicals to their desired location?MUSTAFA SANTIAGO ALI: What we have to make, you know, our transportation as safe as possible. Most folks may not know that we've got 140,000 miles of railway, 100,000 folks in rural communities. Those communities are made up of lower-wealth white communities, and farmers, and Indigenous brothers and sisters, and communities of color. So we've got to make sure that folks have a clear understanding of what's moving through their backyards or front yards, in some instances, and what the dangers could be.With all that transportation that's actually happening, there have been studies that have shown that about 25% million people are in these blast zones that if, you know, one of these things actually exploded. So we've got to just make sure that there is transparency and clear information that is shared in a way that everyday people can wrap their minds around so they can make the best decisions for what they want to push for. Hopefully, it's in stronger protections and regulations to keep folks safe.SEANA SMITH: Mustafa, how do you think the EPA has handled this so far? On the one hand, the EPA saying that they are getting out in front of it. They are doing everything they can. They are going to hold Norfolk Southern financially responsible. On the flip side, critics were saying that they were too slow to respond. What do you think?MUSTAFA SANTIAGO ALI: Well, I've heard about that, I've worked in over 1,000 communities across our country and a few outside. EPA was actually on the ground I believe in about four hours. So that's a pretty good response time. So that's important to get on the ground.The other part of it is making sure that you have individuals there, hopefully, who can share information in a way that folks can understand it. And you've got to make sure that you stay consistent with what's being shared, making sure that you're also open to new possibilities and sharing with people all the various possibilities that might exist in that space. And sometimes that's an area that most definitely needs to be improved. And it causes people to have concerns.So one, they were on the ground quickly. Two, you got to make sure you have those trusted voices with the information. Three, there has to be very consistent sets of actions, and openings, and information for folks to feel comfortable that you are there in a very positive way to support them.- Hate to put you on the spot, but we're just learning of this additional derailment in West Virginia. This is the company CSX, an unknown amount of diesel fuel and oil released into a portion of one of our oldest rivers, part of the National Park Service. Do much about that? And are there more derailments right now, or are we just-- are they being brought to our attention more so than in the past?MUSTAFA SANTIAGO ALI: Well, I think that we're paying much more attention. We know that there are studies that have shown we've had about 1,700 derailments over the last five years. Now that doesn't mean that they had hazardous chemicals on them.I actually grew up in Appalachia. We had a derailment when I was a kid. And we have all these other chemicals that are also a part of it. Like you mentioned, you have oil. You have these byproducts that are also there.I just got an alert about this particular derailment that's happened. And there can be huge impacts, depending on what the chemicals that are being carried. We lost wildlife there in East Palestine.We've now got folks who have all these different types of health challenges that they have identified. And this is another area of a vulnerable community, an environmental justice community, if you will. These are the places that are often unseen and unheard. These are the places that are dis invested in.These are the places that also, lots of times, our sets of legislation, our regulations often aren't giving enough consideration to. So we'll have to unpack exactly what's happened here, what the exposure pathways are. But we've got to do a better job of making sure that we're protecting rural communities across our country, and make sure that their voices are being heard, both in the design of protections, but also in what should be the sets of options when something like this happens, and also making sure their voices are helping to frame out these emergency teams that are put together, and making sure there are individuals who have backgrounds in these areas so that they can share language, share information in a way that is best received.- Hopefully, today's hearing has that impact. Mustafa, really appreciate you being here. Thanks so much.]"

However, the top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.Jason Liberty, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean Group, stated, ""Leisure travel strength continues as consumer spend is shifting towards experiences, with cruising remaining an attractive value proposition. The quality demand trends further exhibit the strength of our brands and the growing propensity to cruise.""Q4 Earnings &amp; RevenuesThe company reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.12, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.37. In the prior-year quarter, it had reported an adjusted loss per share of $4.78 per share.Quarterly revenues of $2,604 million missed the consensus mark of $2,605 million. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported revenues of $982.2 million. The upside was primarily driven by strong cruising demand, better pricing on close-in demand and strong onboard spending.Quarterly HighlightsDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, passenger ticket revenues amounted to $1,702.5 million, up from the prior-year quarter’s revenues of $617.4 million. Onboard and other revenues increased to $901.5 million from $364.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Total cruise operating expenses during the quarter came in at $1,782.4 million compared with $1,135.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesOther Financial InformationAs of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,935 million compared with $1,566.2 million as of Sep 30, 2022.

(NASDAQ:ADI) Is Up But Financials Look Inconsistent: Which Way Is The Stock Headed?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110023185.html,1678446023,STORY,['ADI'],"[Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) stock up by 8.8% over the past three months. However, the company's financials look a bit inconsistent and market outcomes are ultimately driven by long-term fundamentals, meaning that the stock could head in either direction. In this article, we decided to focus on Analog Devices'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:9.4% = US$3.4b ÷ US$37b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 9.4% ROEWhen you first look at it, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 19%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Although, we can see that Analog Devices saw a modest net income growth of 15% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Analog Devices' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 28% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Analog Devices''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Analog Devices Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 75% (or a retention ratio of 25%) for Analog Devices suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Besides, Analog Devices has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 15% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Analog Devices can be open to many interpretations. Although the company has shown a fair bit of growth in earnings, the reinvestment rate is low. Meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits and reinvesting that at a higher rate of return. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

221,16de74ae-accc-37e0-aa63-a803f9e33ef3,ADI,2023-03-10,12 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-small-cap-stocks-insider-200008015.html,1678392008,STORY,"['DSEY', 'KYMR', 'MTX', 'JBGS', 'CRTO', 'TBBK', 'ESTE', 'OXY', 'ADI', 'SYY']","[In this article, we discuss 12 small-cap stocks with insider buying. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying. Insider buying refers to a company's officers, directors, or major shareholders purchasing shares of their own company's stock. Insider purchases can send a positive signal to the market that insiders believe the company's stock is undervalued and has potential for future growth. They also align the interests of the company's management and shareholders. Insider buying can increase transparency and accountability by providing information about the company's financial health and growth potential. This information can help investors make more informed decisions about whether to invest in the company's stock.According to a report from Argus Research in June 2022, corporate insiders seemed to recognize the value of their stocks, as per high trading activity at the time. Vickers Stock Research data was cited by Argus, which noted that insiders purchased shares of their respective companies in large numbers during June’s significant stock market decline. The report stated that the data indicates that corporate insiders were either buying their own company's stock at the same frequency as they were selling it, or they were buying more than they were selling. This surge in insider buying resulted in a sell-to-buy ratio of almost 1.0 in the eight-week period, which the report described as a ""very healthy"" level. Typically, insiders tend to sell their shares 2-2.5 times more frequently than they purchase them. Argus further explained:""While there are many reasons to think stocks could fall further, current insider sentiment is not one of them. Insiders apparently see across-the-board value in stocks as they are ‘keeping the faith.’”Investors should pay attention to the positive signal sent by corporate insiders, especially in light of the current economic climate. With inflation at a 40-year high, interest rates increasing rapidly, and the possibility of a recession looming, insider buying can provide reassurance to investors about the potential health and stability of their investments. Some of the companies which experienced significant insider buying in 2022 include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), and Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). However, in this article, we discuss the top small-cap stocks with insider buying. Story continuesOur Methodology We used a stock screener to filter for small-cap stocks, which have market caps between $300 million to $2 billion. Then we filtered for companies with insider transactions of more than 20%. This metric represents six-month percentage change in total insider ownership. The resultant dataset was ranked according to market cap in the descending order, and we selected the top small-cap firms with insider purchases during 2022 onwards. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider BuyingPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashSmall-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying12.

China has denied those accusations.""We are carrying out police actions aimed at detecting and disrupting these foreign state-backed criminal activities, which may threaten the safety of persons living in Canada,"" the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Quebec said in a statement.Countries including the United States and the Netherlands have conducted similar probes following a report in September by Safeguard Defenders, a Europe-based human rights organization, detailing the presence of dozens of Chinese police ""service stations"" in major cities globally.In November, the RCMP also launched an investigation into similar reports of Chinese ""police service stations"" in the Toronto area. The RCMP in Ontario did not respond to a request for information on that probe on Thursday.The RCMP's deputy commissioner for federal policing, Michael Duheme, told a parliamentary committee last week that the agency has ""taken overt actions"" that led to the ceasing of operations at four alleged Chinese police stations.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not respond to a request for comment. It has previously said that there are centers outside China run by local volunteers, not Chinese police officers, that aim to help Chinese citizens renew documents and offer other services disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.Story continuesThe Quebec RCMP alleged that Canadians of Chinese origin have been ""victims of the possible activities"" conducted by two centers, in Montreal and nearby Brossard, it has identified as possible police stations run by Beijing.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told parliament on Thursday his government would take every measure to protect Canadians from ""unacceptable actions by hostile authoritarian regimes.""VISA DENIEDTensions between Canada and China soared in late 2018 when Canadian police detained an executive of the Chinese company Huawei Technologies Co, which was followed by Beijing's arrest of two Canadians on spying charges. All three were freed in 2021. More recently, accusations of election interference by China have strained relations.Last autumn, Canada denied a visa to a Chinese diplomat after authorities found the individual was a ""political operative,"" Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told a parliamentary committee on Thursday.""When China wanted to send a political operative last fall, we decided to deny a visa,"" she said during the committee's hearings focused on allegations of Chinese election interference.Joly's disclosure followed Trudeau's announcement on Monday that he will appoint an independent special investigator to probe those allegations and also announced separate new probes into the suspected foreign meddling.

Illinois Tool Works has around 45,000 employees and generates annual revenue of nearly $16 billion.Given its focus on the construction and industrial sectors, Illinois Tool Works is a cyclical stock that tends to perform best when the economy is doing well. However, despite mounting concerns of a potential recession, shares have outperformed over the past year, gaining 11.6% compared with a 6.5% loss for the S&amp;P 500. Over the past 10 years, ITW is up 288% versus 160% for the broader market.Story continuesAnother reason for investors to put ITW on their list of industrial stocks to buy is its dividend. The company is a dividend king, having raised its dividend for 59 consecutive years. With a quarterly payout of $1.31 per share, the stock yields 2.3%.United Rentals (URI)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for United Rentals (URI).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of industrial stocks to buy that have outperformed, how about United Rentals (NYSE:URI)? The equipment rental business has been very good to United Rentals and its shareholders. The Connecticut-based company’s share price has increased 34% this year, 50% over the past 12 months, and 151% in the past five years.The company owns the largest rental fleet in the world with 4,600 classes of equipment for rent collectively valued at nearly $20 billion. It rents construction equipment such as forklifts, backhoes, bulldozers and excavators. United Rentals also rents out plumbing and HVAC equipment, as well as portable toilets that are used on job sites.United Rentals has nearly 25,000 employees and generated $11.6 billion in revenue for 2022. In addition to operating in every region of the U.S. and Canada, United Rentals is expanding across Europe, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. The $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law in the U.S. last year is expected to be a boon for the company.Amphenol (APH)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockMost investors haven’t heard of Amphenol (NYSE:APH). And that’s understandable since the company has scant analyst coverage and gets almost no media coverage. Yet, the Connecticut-based company has been a very good investment for a very long time.The company got its start in 1932 as the American Phenolic Corporation making tube sockets for radio tubes, which, at the time, were considered to be cutting edge. During World War II, the company became the primary manufacturer of connectors used in the Allied forces’ airplanes and radios. Today, the company produces coaxial cables and fiber optic connectors. Basically, Amphenol makes the nuts and bolts that keep our tech devices running smoothly.While the company flies under the radar, it is a major corporation with more than 90,000 employees and 2022 sales of $12.6 billion. Best of all, APH stock has been a steady outperformer. Over the past 30 years, the stock has gained more than 32,000%, averaging an annual gain of more than 20%.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Here Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Be Adding To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-host-hotels-properties-204758112.html,1678394878,STORY,"['HST', 'MAR', 'AC.PA']","[When an investor decides to buy a real estate investment trust (REIT), they are buying both that real estate company and the large block of tenants or brands occupying the REIT’s portfolio.Before you decide to buy a REIT, it pays to consider the history and solvency of its largest tenants. Ask yourself these questions: Are there any tenants who are facing bankruptcy or reducing their size? Are the tenants of high-grade quality? Are the tenants diversified, not only geographically, but also by each tenant accounting for a small percentage of the total tenant portfolio?Take a look at one well-known hotel REIT, and consider the questions raised above in evaluating its merits:Check out the latest private market real estate offering announcements from Benzinga:Missoula Marriott Portfolio - Two Marriott Hotels With A Target IRR Of 15.2%Port 99 Industrial Park - Industrial Park Development With A 22.5% Target IRRHost Hotels and Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel REIT that calls itself “the world’s largest lodging REIT.” It’s an S&amp;P 500 company that owns and operates 42,214 rooms in 78 hotels, including 20 of the largest markets across the U.S. and another five hotels in Canada and Brazil. It was formed in 1993 and has a market capitalization of $12.63 billion.Most of Host Hotels’ properties are upscale and luxury hotels in central business districts that are located near airports. These hotels generally include amenities such as restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and gift shops. Of its 78 hotels, 28 contain more than 500 rooms. The U.S. locations are below:host hotels property mapThe average age of Host Hotels and Resorts properties is 35 years. The geographic diversity of Host Hotels and Resorts’ properties, as shown above, is an advantage, especially if certain areas hold up better than others during a recession.Host Hotels and Resorts’ portfolio includes several well-known names. Its tenant brands are:Story continuesBRANDNUMBER OF HOTELSROOMSPERCENTAGE OF REVENUESMARRIOTT5129,30260.4HYATT138,30521.0ACCOR HOTELS415173.4HILTON412692.9OTHERS/INDEPENDENTS6182111.6Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) is also based in Bethesda and owns and operates Marriott hotels, along with names such as The Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Westin, Four Points, St. Regis and others. The Marriott company was founded in 1927, and its hotels have been around since the 1950s. Today it includes 30 sub-brands and 8,000 properties across 139 countries.Marriott International has a $53.55 billion market cap and a dividend yield of 0.92%.Hyatt Hotels Corp. (NYSE: H), also known as Hyatt Hotels &amp; Resorts, is a Chicago-based company that began in 1957 and grew to include international hotels and resorts by 1969. It owns 26 distinct brands in over 1,100 hotels around the world. The majority of its brands are upscale and luxury hotels.Accor S.A. (AC.PA) is a multinational company based in France that owns, manages and franchises hotels, resorts and vacation properties. Accor was founded in 1967 and is now the largest hospitality company in Europe and the sixth-largest hospitality company in the world. It has 5,300 locations in 110 countries. Accor and Marriott are the two largest hotel companies in the Middle East.Accor owns several brands of its own, including Banyan Tree, Sofitel Legend, Fairmont, Novotel, Emblems and others. In 2021, Accor took in 2.2 billion euros. Its portfolio of 40 brands ranges from economy to luxury and premium brands.Hilton Hotels Corp. (NYSE: HLT), also known as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. is a Tysons Corner, Virginia-based multinational hospitality company that manages and franchises hotels throughout the world.In 1919, Conrad Hilton purchased a hotel in Cisco, Texas, called The Mobley. Over the next few years, Hilton branched out to purchase other Texas hotels, and after changing the name to Hilton Hotels, expanded across the U.S.Today the Hilton Hotel portfolio includes 19 sub-brands with 7,165 total properties in 123 countries and territories. Some of its brands include Waldorf Astoria, Conrad Hotels &amp; Resorts and Canopy by Hilton.Hilton Hotels' stock has a market cap of $39.4 billion.These are well-known hotels and resorts, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of travelers each year. But having too many eggs in one basket is always a problem for a company, and so the enormous percentage of revenue derived from The Marriott brand alone could potentially become a problem for Host Hotels and Resorts.While it’s not likely that such a long-standing company that’s as financially solid as Marriott would go out of business, it’s possible that a negative social, environmental or political event could tarnish its reputation, creating vacancies and putting a dent into Host Hotels and Resorts’ revenue. Investors may remember the food poisoning outbreaks at Chipotle between 2016 and 2018 and what they did to the share price of that stock as consumers stayed away in droves.Having only four hotel chains in its portfolio and deriving 88% of its revenue from such a small number considerably enhances the risk for Host Hotels and Resorts. None of these hotels seems to be at risk of bankruptcy or financial difficulties at the moment. Travel has increased across the globe as the pandemic has abated, and the hotel REIT subsector has done tremendously well year-to-date.Host Hotel and Resorts’ fourth-quarter earnings were reported on Feb. 15. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.44 beat the consensus estimate by $0.02, and revenue of $1.26 billion was $10 million better than the Street’s view. More importantly, the FFO was 51% better than FFO of $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2021, and revenue was a 26.55% increase over revenue of $998 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) also increased from $237.98 in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $325.33.But if increasing interest rates bring about a hard recession, those positive RevPAR numbers could easily change. Companies typically reduce their travel expenses to save money, and consumers put off vacations if the economy deteriorates.Investors may also be wondering why Host Hotels and Resorts pays such a stingy quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. The annual dividend yields 2.83%, fairly low for a REIT. The present payout ratio is only 26.9%. By contrast, Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) pays a 5.8% dividend yield.Host Hotels and Resorts is still playing catch-up from when it suspended its $0.20 dividend after March 2020. It reinstate it in March 2022 but only at a paltry $0.03. But Host Hotels and Resorts also paid a special dividend of $0.20 in December, in addition to its regular $0.12 quarterly dividend payment.The picture appears to be mixed for Host Hotels and Resorts. While it has solid brands and improving metrics, the headwinds of recession and its reliance on a small number of brands for most of its revenue could ultimately lead to a decline in Host Hotels and Regions earnings, translating into a declining share price.From a technical viewpoint, the recent share price collapse below the 200-day moving average is also a negative.

This has been a further catalyst for both stocks with Broadcom sporting an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Momentum while Nvidia sports a “B”.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationWith Nvidia and Broadcom stock soaring over the last six months, investors will want to monitor their valuation. In this regard, Broadcom stands out with a “B” Style Scores grade for Value with Nvidia landing a “D” grade at the moment.AVGO trades at $622 per share but just 15.6X forward earnings which is nicely below its industry average of 19.4X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.3X. Even better, Broadcom stock trades 36% beneath its decade high of 24.5X and at a slight discount to the median of 16.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Nvidia, NVDA shares trade at $234 and 53.8X forward earnings which is well above the industry average of 23.4X, but the company is a leader. However, this is notably above the S&amp;P 500 as well, and while Nvidia trades 42% below its decade high of 93.5X it also trades 42% above the median of 37.9X.Story continuesGrowth The growth prospects of Nvidia and Broadcom could be a further indication of more upside in their stocks and their outlooks are still attractive. Broadcom has an “A” Style Scores grade for Growth with Nvidia at a “B”.Nvidia’s year-over-year growth is very appealing and Broadcom’s bottom line remains massive with the company still growing. Broadcom’s earnings are expected to jump 9% in fiscal 2023 and rise another 6% in FY24 at $43.65 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 6% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 to $36.80 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTurning to Nvidia, its fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to soar 34% and climb another 33% in FY25 at $5.98. Sales are expected to rise 10% in FY24 and leap another 24% in FY25 to $36.83 billionZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayNvidia and Broadcom stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). There could be better buying opportunities ahead after such stellar rallies to start the year but holding on to both stocks at their current levels could be rewarding especially when considering their momentum at the moment.While NVDA and AVGO shares may look due for a large pullback their historical performances also indicate it may be worth holding on to these semiconductor giants.To that point, Nvidia stock is up a mind-boggling +7,308% over the last decade with Broadcom up an impressive +1,633% to easily top the Nasdaq’s +249% and the S&amp;P 500‘s +159%.Furthermore, Nvidia should continue offering valuable exposure to visual computing technologies through its graphic chips with Broadcom providing diversity through a broad range of semiconductor devices and solutions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Showing that a cutting-edge model can be moved to Groq's chips easily could help the startup prove that its products are a viable alternative to Nvidia.Groq has been trying to chip away at Nvidia's market share, along with startups such as SambaNova and Cerebras and big companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Intel Corp.Efforts to find alternative chips to Nvidia's have gained extra steam with the popularity of ChatGPT which has focused attention on Nvidia's dominant role in AI. The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet to China's Baidu Inc to trumpet their own offerings.Meta made its code available to researchers for noncommercial use. Groq used Meta's model but stripped out the code that was included in order to make the model run on an Nvidia chip, Groq CEO Jonathan Ross told Reuters.Groq then ran that model through Groq Compiler which automatically adds specific code for it to run on its own computing system. A compiler turns code into ones and zeros so a chip can read them.Ross said the company's goal is to make it easy to move models from Nvidia's chips to its own. He said using the Groq system can also eliminate engineering effort each time changes are made to the LlaMA or other models to get it to work on the chips.Meta Platforms declined to comment. The company has been working on making it easier for developers to use non-Nvidia chips and in October launched a set of free software tools for AI applications that enable switching back and forth between Nvidia and AMD chips.(Reporting by Jane Lanhee Lee in Oakland, California, and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

The deal will also include streaming and subscription parity to put future Call of Duty games on the PlayStation Plus subscription service on day one, just like its Game Pass.The offer is outlined in Microsoft’s response to the Competition and Markets Authority’s provisional findings on the deal, released last month.This follows Sony’s disapproval over Microsoft's earlier offer to keep the popular game series made by Activision Blizzard on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement expires.However, Sony Interactive Entertainment (""SIE"") has raised concerns about the potential for unsustainable licensing costs that could force the company to raise prices. After the Activision deal, Microsoft will get to choose the size of licensing fees for Sony to have Call of Duty on PlayStation Plus. Sony argues that the Xbox maker could make this fee too expensive.SIE alleges that this could result in Call of Duty becoming a Game Pass exclusive by default, dominating multi-game subscription services in the future.Microsoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteMicrosoft’s Deal With Other Tech Players to Convince SonyMicrosoft has been offering concessions in the form of multi-year deals involving Call of Duty to appease regulators’ concerns over its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition.It was reported earlier that the European Union will not be blocking this deal after the Xbox maker signed 10-year deals with Nintendo and Nvidia NVDA to bring Xbox and Activision games (including Call of Duty) on their respective services.Last month, Microsoft and NVDA announced that the companies have agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring Xbox PC games to the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service, which has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries.The agreement will enable gamers to stream Xbox PC titles from GeForce NOW to PCs, macOS, Chromebooks, smartphones and other devices.

And the reality is, there is no good time to do it… Standing on stage in front of 400 people I knew were personally thinking about the impact on their families, that was a hard, emotional moment. But you know, you lead through that... We lost about 80% of our California-based workers, but we expected that, so we were prepared.”Soon after announcing the move, the company was thrown into the COVID crisis. McKesson was chosen by the CDC to play a key role in distributing the COVID vaccine…a role it performed admirably, and which Tyler said gave the company a new sense of mission.“In a matter of 90 days, we had put up 3.3 million square feet of dedicated facilities, with the wiring, the racking, the training. Some of this was handled at sub-freezing temperatures, and our workers were literally bundled with layers of clothes... Kudos to them. The heroes in Memphis and Louisville that showed up and pulled this off… We had one singular priority. We knew how essential it was. If there was a request or something related to COVID, it went to the top of everybody's work pile.”Alyson asked him about the opioid charges, which McKesson paid $7.4 billion to settle. His response:“We structured that to make sure that the maximum amount of dollars possible — over 85% — went to treatments and programs that will help this country get through this crisis… We wanted to make sure any settlement dollars didn’t get reallocated to fix potholes or build infrastructure.”Story continuesBut I still thought he stopped short of accepting full responsibility:“We're not a bad company. We made mistakes. We were a small part of a system that failed… But make no mistake, it wasn't a failure of any one party. It was a system failure, in my view.”Not sure I buy that. As the largest distributor, McKesson was much more than a small player. It had the most comprehensive data, and should have known better than anyone where excess supplies were going. The best way to assure this doesn’t happen again is to be clear about how it could have been stopped before. There’s more than a “system” at fault.More news below.Alan Murray@alansmurrayalan.murray@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersChatGPT helped me make a plan to buy a $500,000 home, but experts warn me it's a bad ideaThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

NVRO recently announced that it has now initiated the U.S. full market launch of its Senza HFX iQ spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, following the completion of a successful limited market release. The system is currently the only SCS System that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize and maintain pain relief using individual patient responses.The Senza HFX iQ system is comprised of the HFX iQ Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG), HFX Trial Stimulator and HFX App. With a new bluetooth-enabled IPG that is upgradeable and connects directly to the HFX App, each patient can input assessments into their smartphone and then receive programming adjustments in real time.Apart from the U.S. approval for Senza HFX iQ, Nevro has submitted for approval in Europe and Australia.The latest launch is expected to strengthen Nevro’s foothold in the SCS therapy business.Significance of the LaunchHFX iQ is expected to combine clinical inputs (such as pain relief and pain score) and Quality of Life inputs (such as pain medication and activity level changes) to provide a personalized program setting for each patient. The system will likely offer both low-frequency and Nevro’s own high-frequency 10 kHz Therapy.The Senza high-frequency 10 kHz Therapy has been validated in both clinical and real-world outcomes and offers unique AI-driven iQ modes specifically for treating painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) and chronic back and leg pain, including non-surgical back pain (NSBP).Per an expert familiar with the use of SCS, the best way to proceed with SCS is with precision medicine, powered by big data and AI. Hence, by combining all the programming experience and clinical outcomes of patients across the United States and providing the same to the patient to monitor and offer them the best program for their exact situation with a tap on the screen holds the promise of improved care.Per Nevro’s management, the Senza HFX iQ system is a significant advancement to SCS therapy as the system will likely apply the big data collected over time to help patients find pain relief faster and maintain that relief over time.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Market Data Forecast, the global SCS market was estimated to be $2032.5 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $3070 million by 2027 at a CAGR of 8.6%. Factors like rising cases of chronic and neuropathic pain and the growing adoption of SCS therapy are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly boost Nevro’s business.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Nevro announced its fourth-quarter 2022 results, where it saw an improvement in overall top-line and bottom-line results and robust domestic revenues. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures were also recorded.The improvement in U.S. PDN trial was also registered. The robust performance of Nevro’s new AI-powered HFX iQ SCS System in the limited market release, with positive feedback from physicians and patients, raised optimism about the stock.In December 2022, Nevro announced that two abstracts for PDN and NSBP were accepted for podium presentations at the North American Neuromodulation Society Annual Meeting and would be presented during the late-breaking plenary sessions in January.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 53.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 11.9% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 7.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Nevro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

CTLT is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its product and service launches over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with a slew of strategic deals over the past few months, is expected to contribute further. Catalent’s operation in a competitive landscape and forex woes pose threats.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 29% compared with the 13.9% decline of the industry and 7.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global developer and supplier of better treatments has a market capitalization of $12.57 billion. Catalent projects 7.7% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Catalent’s earnings yield of 4.5% is favorable to the industry’s negative yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product and Service Launches: We are upbeat about Catalent’s product and service launches over the past few months. Last month, the company announced the launch of TASCENSO orally disintegrating tablet (ODT), its first product to treat multiple sclerosis patients in the United States.In January, Catalent announced the launch of its new Case Management Service, specifically designed to address the unique challenges associated with the safe and timely delivery of advanced therapies to patients by providing professional supply chain oversight from program start to finish.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about Catalent’s robust growth opportunities via its recent tie-ups and buyouts. During its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in February, the company confirmed that it had extended its collaboration with Moderna to broaden manufacturing partnership across multiple products and formats in North America and Europe.In January, Catalent announced that it had executed a development and license agreement with Ethicann Pharmaceuticals Inc. to develop Ethicann’s clinical drug pipeline using Catalent’s proprietary Zydis ODT technology.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Catalent’s solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 fall results buoy optimism. The year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment at constant exchange rate is impressive. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well. Catalent has undertaken some facility expansion activities over the past few months, raising our optimism.DownsidesForex Woes: Catalent has significant operations outside the United States. Hence, changes in the exchange rates or any other applicable currency to the U.S. dollar will affect its operations. Volatility in currency exchange rates and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort the company may undertake to manage or mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies.Stiff Competition: Catalent operates in a highly competitive market, wherein it competes with multiple companies, including those offering advanced delivery technologies and outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing. The company also competes in some cases with the internal operations of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health customers with manufacturing capabilities and chooses to source these services internally.Estimate TrendCatalent has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2.2% south to $3.11.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, suggesting a 9.7% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue estimate of $1.17 billion, suggesting an 8.1% plunge from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Also on display will be Air Products' Freshline® MP Tunnel Freezer, a state-of-the-art multi-purpose freezer designed to provide exceptional performance and optimal flexibility while incorporating the latest international hygiene features.Expo attendees are invited to stop by Air Products' booth 1074 to speak with industry specialists about their specific processes and challenges. Seafood processors will discover the many benefits of Air Products' Freshline® solutions to improve a variety of processes, such as food freezing and chilling. The extremely cold temperatures of these cryogenic gases enable food products to be chilled or frozen in minutes instead of the hours traditionally required with alternative systems. This rapid freeze results in smaller product weight losses and helps to ensure moisture and quality are maintained longer.For more than a half-century, Air Products' liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) have been used to chill products to the ideal forming temperature. In the food industry, liquid nitrogen and CO2 are commonly used to power tunnel and spiral freezers for the final preservation of food before it is packaged and shipped. These freezers offer customers smaller footprints and significantly lower cost compared to mechanical systems.A leader in cryogenic technology applications, Air Products operates food laboratories in the United States, Europe and Asia, where the company can test a customer's product on commercial-scale equipment to determine the feasibility of using cryogenic freezing or chilling for their specific process and quantify the cost benefits of using cryogenics. The company also provides engineering services, as well as on-site testing capability and processing audits to reduce cryogen consumption.Story continuesTo learn more about Air Products' participation at Seafood North America and the company's complete portfolio of Freshline® solutions for seafood processors, visit Air Products' Cold Zone website.About Air ProductsAir Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

246,d183fc11-6c0a-3aac-8a79-88f2e099c031,APD,2023-03-10,Why Is DuPont de Nemours (DD) Down 6.2% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-dupont-nemours-dd-down-163004202.html,1678379404,STORY,"['DD', 'APD']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for DuPont de Nemours (DD). Shares have lost about 6.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DuPont de Nemours due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.DuPont's Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates in Q4DuPont logged earnings (on a reported basis) from continuing operations of 20 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2022, down from 29 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Barring one-time items, earnings came in at 89 cents per share for the reported quarter, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. DuPont raked in net sales of $3,104 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter. It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,083.2. The company saw a 5% rise in organic sales in the quarter, supported by 7% higher pricing that offset 2% lower volumes. The company was challenged by weak conditions in electronics and construction end-markets in the reported quarter. It benefited from disciplined pricing actions to offset inflation.Sustained strength in water solutions, growth in the automotive adhesives portfolio and gains in certain industrial end-markets were more than offset by weakness in smartphones and personal computing, the slowdown in semiconductor and construction and lower volumes from protective garments.Segment HighlightsThe company’s Electronics &amp; Industrial segment recorded net sales of $1,343 million in the reported quarter, down 8% on a year-over-year comparison basis. Organic sales fell 2% as higher prices were more than offset by reduced volumes. Semiconductor Technologies organic sales rose on higher pricing. Industrial Solutions also registered higher sales while organic sales declined in Interconnect Solutions on lower volumes.Net sales in the Water &amp; Protection unit were $1,497 million, up 6% year over year. Organic sales rose 12% on pricing gains.Story continuesFY22 ResultsEarnings from continuing operations for full-year 2022 were $2.02 per share compared with $2.16 per share a year ago. Net sales went up around 4% year over year to $13 billion.FinancialsDuPont had cash and cash equivalents of $3,662 million at the end of 2022, up around 86% year over year. Long-term debt was $7,774 million, down around 27% year over year.The company also generated operating cash flow of $126 million during the quarter and $588 million in 2022.OutlookThe company sees net sales for 2023 to be $12,300-$12,900 million. Adjusted earnings per share for 2023 is forecast to be $3.50-$4.00.For first-quarter 2023, the company sees net sales of roughly $2,900 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter is projected at roughly 80 cents.DuPont also envisions sustained strength in water and automotive adhesives and stable demand across industrial end-markets including aerospace and healthcare products in 2023. The company, however, sees lower volumes during first-half 2023 in consumer electronics and semiconductors due to reduced consumer spending, inventory destocking and COVID-related impacts in China. It also expects weakness in construction end-markets in Water &amp; Protection during 2023. DuPont projects organic sales to decline in the mid single-digits year over year in the first quarter due to continued weakness in these consumer-driven markets.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -17.38% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, DuPont de Nemours has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, DuPont de Nemours has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerDuPont de Nemours is part of the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry. Over the past month, Air Products and Chemicals (APD), a stock from the same industry, has gained 1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.Air Products and Chemicals reported revenues of $3.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6%.

A second ex-executive was acquitted.A Brooklyn federal jury deliberated four days before returning the verdicts. Hernan Lopez, the former CEO of Fox International Channels, was convicted. Carlos Martinez, who headed the Latin America affiliate, was acquitted.Prosecutors said the case revealed the corruption of international soccer. Defense lawyers said the former Fox execs were framed by an admitted criminal who was trying to minimize his own punishment.An emotional Lopez hugged supporters in the courtroom after hearing the verdict, while his attorneys appeared stunned. The judge allowed him to be released on bail pending sentencing.John Gleeson, an attorney for Lopez, asserted there were “legal and factual errors.""“We look forward to vindicating our client on appeal,” he said.Martinez's lawyer, Steve McCool, said “justice was served today for Carlos.""""The jurors heard that he was an innocent man, and that he should never have been here in the first place,” McCool said outside court.A South American sports media and marketing company also was convicted of graft allegations — involving different TV rights. Full Play Group SA, incorporated in Uruguay, was accused of paying bribes for the rights to the Copa America, a quadrennial national team competition, as well as to World Cup qualifying matches.New York-based Fox Corp., which split from a subsidiary of international channels during a restructuring in 2019, was not charged and has denied any involvement in the bribery scandal.Lopez and Martinez are among dozens of people who have pleaded guilty or been convicted after a U.S.-led investigation into international soccer and its governing federation, FIFA. The probe burst into view in 2015, when U.S. prosecutors accused the leaders of soccer federations of tarnishing the sport for nearly a quarter century by taking $150 million in bribes and payoffs.Story continuesFIFA went on to expand and rename its executive leadership group. Then-President Sepp Blatter was forced out and replaced by current President Gianni Infantino, who has insisted the organization has reformed. However, it has in recent years been criticized for tolerating alleged abuse of migrant workers during the construction of World Cup stadiums used in Qatar last year and of maintaining inferior payments and tournament arrangements for women players.In the Lopez and Martinez case, prosecutors’ star witness was the executives’ former business associate Alejandro Burzaco. He has cooperated in soccer corruption investigations since his 2015 arrest in a related bribery case.During 11 days on the witness stand, Burzaco said he and the two executives paid millions of dollars in bribes to undermine competing bids for the TV rights to the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest annual tournament, the Copa Libertadores, and help land broadcasting rights to the sport’s most lucrative competition, the World Cup.Two jurors who agreed to speak after the trial said Burzaco was not a factor in their decisions.“We didn’t find him credible,” said one of the jurors, Robert Rose, who works as an attorney.Instead jurors relied on reams of documents presented during the case.Rose said “it wasn't tough” to convict Lopez, and jurors wrestled over reaching a verdict for Martinez. In the end, Rose said, “there was enough doubt.”Defense lawyers said Burzaco lied about the former Fox executives to minimize his own conduct and curry favor with the government ahead of his own sentencing. He pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges.Prosecutors allege the payoffs yielded confidential information from high-ranking soccer officials, including those at FIFA, that enabled Fox to beat out rival ESPN and secure U.S. broadcasting rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.___Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington and Jennifer Peltz in New York contributed.]"

Throughout the two-hour documentary, viewers will hear first-hand accounts from Hall and those who were integral to his rescue and recovery, including with his wife Alicia Meller, Zakrzewski’s widow Michelle Ross-Stanton, best friend Rick Findler, FOX News correspondents Jennifer Griffin, Trey Yingst, and Greg Palkot, Save Our Allies co-founder Sarah Verardo, a number of doctors and surgeons who helped him, among others. Additionally, the program will also unveil never-before-seen video of the moments leading up to the attack, captured by Zakrzewski himself.Story continuesFOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service and has been the number one network in basic cable for the last six years and the most-watched television news channel for more than 21 consecutive years, currently attracting more than 50% of the cable news viewing audience according to Nielsen Media Research.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Berman.Story continuesStephen G. BermanThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we recap the quarter and year and share our thoughts about what we're seeing in the months and quarters ahead. Our fourth quarter sales ended up slightly exceeding our expectations despite our exceptionally strong results early in the year. Our fourth quarter net sales totaled $131.9 million, bringing our full year net sales to $796.2 million, the highest annual result since 2014.As we anticipated, sales were down 30% in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year, largely attributable to our prioritizing FOB selling early in 2022 and the related changes in seasonality of our business. Our full year growth was driven by a combination of key SKUs across our major brands. In our Nintendo business, both our Mario Kart 24V Ride-on Racer and Let's Go, Yoshi Interactive Action Figure had great launches. Our Sonic Movie 2 Speed RC had a tremendous year. Our Disney Princess Style Collection Kitchen and Suitcase continued to deliver. In addition, we had 2 strong entertainment-led product lines for Disney's Encanto and SegaSonic the Hedgehog.I'm happy to report that in total, 7 of our top largest toy consumer products segments grew in calendar year 2022. We had a very strong holiday season led by key SKUs across our major brands. And our Disease Encanto Magical Casa Magical, we've discussed before, but it's worth bringing up again, it's been such a great item for us.And as we stated on our call, 2022 was our largest selling year with the Sky since the acquisition in 2008. We finished the year at $148.9 million in net sales, a 38% increase over 2021. In reviewing the year, customers clearly chased the Halloween holiday in a couple of cases a bit too much, which was a bit of recalibrating in 2023. That said, this business has never been better with our brand assortment of popular licenses and steady build and capture of the international opportunity we think exists.Last year at this time, we were deep in the chaos of inbound shipping delays, with nearly 30% or approximately $20-plus million worth of our owned inventory in transit to one of our warehouses rather than being ready to ship. I'm happy to say that we closed 2022 with only $4.9 million in transit to our warehouses and our overall owned inventory was down to $80.6 million heading into the new year.As we have stated in recent quarters and really going back to our 2019 recapitalization, it's been a priority to reduce the overall leverage and interest expense. Although our 2021 refinancing was a positive step in that direction, the rising market interest rates in the past few quarters has increased the overall rate of our term loan above 10% per year.With that in mind, we have been extremely focused on freeing up cash where we can. Our exceptional performance in 2022 in combination with our unusually heavy first half seasonality combined to generate over $86 million in operating cash flow in 2022. As we reported in recent quarters, we allocated $27.5 billion to the optional term loan pay downs in 2022.In addition, we're reporting today that we made an additional optional payment earlier this quarter of $15 million, $5 million of which incurred a 3% prepayment fee. The ECF sweep provision of our term loan also required us to make an additional mandatory paydown of $23.1 million without any prepayment fees. When we tally up these additional payments, the current payoff level of our term loan as of today is just $30.8 million. We are beyond proud of these improvements to our balance sheet. We are following our road map of lowering our borrowing costs and evaluating the broader array of options afforded to us as we increasingly engage the market from a position of financial strength.As you have often heard me say on these calls, when you're in an industry like ours, it's imperative to be resilient and stay attentive to always the changing dynamics of the world in which we live in. We were not immune from the issues that other companies in our space experienced last year as it relates to how customers track consumer demand and plan for the holiday season. Slowing customer demand in our seasonal business in the second half (inaudible) our supply chain, generating excessive costs associated with warehousing and importation of product, despite lower container spot rates in the second half of the year. This hurt the productivity of our warehousing operations and merely taking some aggressive actions as it relates to valuing of our own inventory.Our toy and kids consumer products point of sale remained up double digits in Q4 at our top 3 accounts, and we think we've performed better in this area than our peer groups. Nonetheless, our provisions for sales allowance in Q4 weren't favorable to our 2021 results like many in the industry. These factors were the primary drivers of our fourth quarter gross margin finishing at 21.7% compared to the 26.6% reported in Q4 2021. John will go through the math in a bit more detail when I hand over the phone to him, but I wanted to highlight this as a clear area for improvement in 2023.With that said, the year ended up pretty much where we thought it would be and planned it to be, since our last call. Most of us have been in this business a long time. So forgive me for recapping one more time of the full year highlights.Full year net sales of $796.2 million, a 28% increase over 2021 and a 54% increase over our pandemic low of $515.9 million in 2020. Full year operating income of $61 million and operating margin of 7.7%, a 140 basis point improvement over 2021, 6.3%. Full year adjusted EBITDA of $76.4 million, up 55% compared to last year and a highest level since 2010.At JAKKS, we are thankful and appreciative of all of our success as we know how challenging this business can be. We intend to continue to focus on timeless brands and categories, our singles and doubles that might not be exciting for everyone but represents the foundation of which our business was built. We continue to actively pursue the most relevant IP rights for our model with the knowledge that sometimes pass it on an opportunity is more prudent than chasing new business at any cost.In 2023, we will continue to expand our North American distribution footprint beyond the major customers. In addition, as you know, we have been methodically going deeper into the largest international markets with both toy, kids consumer products and cost businesses, and we intend to continue that in 2023 as well. I'll stop here and let John go a bit deeper into some of the financials, and then we'll come back to talk more about 2023 and beyond. John?John KimbleThank you, Stephen, and hi, everybody. As regulator listeners know, there's a greater level of granular detail included in our release today, but I'm going to be selective in what I highlight here towards what I think merit is focused attention. We're pretty happy with how the year ended from a shipping perspective, delivering the 20-plus percent top line growth we talked about last quarter and doing so for the second year in a row. As Stephen alluded to, we saw similar trends as others in the industry as it relates to consumer sell-through at retail, inclusive of a bit more of the traditional rush in the last couple of weeks. The shelves could have been a bit more empty on 12/31. We don't think we distinguished ourselves to the negative on that front, which is helpful from a big picture point of view.Gross margin is clearly an area where we are experiencing more challenges, being proactive as it relates to cleaning up inventory is something you pay for here, especially in a smaller shipping quarter. Royalties continue to run a bit higher as expected. Our tooling amortization is trending up a bit. We've talked about CapEx being up a bit this year as we duplicated tools on some lines to chase demand. One of the bigger expense areas here is from lack of warehouse productivity. To geek out on it briefly, inbound freight and a portion of warehousing is capitalized to product, and that math is driven in part by how much we've spent on warehousing during the year. and also how much product we're importing during the year. When you consider how we've been trying to work down inventory since the beginning of last year, and we experienced higher warehousing expense this year dealing with the supply chain backing up a bit and our needing to secure some incremental space, that math doesn't work in our favor.You have more costs than you'd like and less product to spread the cost over. The result then flows through your P&amp;L. Everything wasn't bad here. We did have some improvements in landed cost margin year-over-year, and we're lapping the excessive container cost of last year. But when you add it all up, gross margin for the quarter was 21.7% or 490 basis points worse than Q4 of last year. Full year gross margin ends up at 26.5% or 300 basis points below 2021. The 2022 gross margin percentage, however, is not adjusted for the portion of co-op advertising, which we moved into sales allowances at the beginning of 2022. Historically, that number is in the 200 to 250 basis point range. So you can adjust that out, if you want, a more accurate year-over-year comparison here as you ponder what might be feasible in 2023.Direct selling in the quarter was roughly in line with our expectations aside from the aforementioned higher warehousing expenses. The year-over-year number is negative on the P&amp;L as the co-op advertising element is now recorded above net sales. G&amp;A, inclusive of product development and testing and depreciation and amortization was $31.1 million, up from $27.9 million in Q4 2021. On a full year basis, that number was $116.7 million, a 15% increase over 2021.The main driver there has been our adding back positions post pandemic to support the expansion of the business over the past couple of years. Our noncomp-related G&amp;A, inclusive of stock comp expense, grew high single digits on a full year basis, which feels reasonable as you think about 2022 being more return to office and pre-Covid norms for us, as well as there being a bit of variable spend in that number. We have been working on a bottoms-up review of spending as we started new year to ensure that we're minimizing and optimizing our expenditures.On a full year basis, our operating margin of 7.7% was as high as that number has been since 2008. Closing the books this year required a lot more time and effort as it relates to our tax provision, shout out to the tax team. We've concluded a 382 analysis in both the federal and state levels to refine the level of net operating losses or NOLs we expect to utilize in the years to come in light of a couple of impairments that we have identified as taking place in 2019 and 2021. A longer recap on this topic will be included in our 10-K filing. As part of that exercise and in conjunction with our financial projections, as part of this quarter's close, we're releasing a valuation allowance against a portion of those historical NOLs. This release generates a one time noncash gain of $52.6 million as part of this quarter's P&amp;L, which we have adjusted out of our adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS calculations.Looking forward, we'd anticipate being around 21% as an effective tax rate in 2023. Although Stephen walked you through it, I want to revisit the current state of our debt. As part of our annual close process, we generated full year operating cash flow of $86.1 million. When adjusting for CapEx and optional paydowns we made during the year, our term loan has a mandatory paydown provision, which calls for a payment of half of that amount. And as a result, we have moved that dollar amount, $23.1 million, to short-term debt as part of our 12/31 balance sheet.We have, in fact, gone ahead and made that payment as our numbers finalized. In addition, we made an optional pay down in January of $15 million, the last $5 million of which included a 3% prepayment fee of $150,000. When you add those 2 amounts together for total payments of $38.1 million to date in 2023, that reduces our current term loan payoff amount to $30.8 million. The carrying amount is slightly lower given unamortized loan fees, but that will be addressed as part of our Q1 close process.As of March 3, our unrestricted cash balance was $37.9 million, net of those loan paydowns, and we currently have no draw on our ABL. This is the time of the year where our liquidity tends to get tight as we are building product for second half consumer demand, but we're comfortable based upon our projections that we can navigate towards the second half of the year, leaning on our ABL line if needed. Relevant interest rate on our loan is around 11.2% in Q1 as the drastically reduced balance of the associated interest expense is less of a drag on our results, acknowledging the drawing on our ABL is also more expensive these days given the higher Fed funds rate. In any case, currently job #1 remains executing against this year's operating plan. We clearly had an atypically robust revenue line last year driven by a couple of hits. We have a lot of great initiatives this year. Stephen will soon highlight. But how those 2 ultimately bounce out is inevitably hard to project if one is being honest.We have clear opportunities to improve gross margins, and then the challenge becomes what sort of scale can we get out of our fixed cost base. With a lower interest expense projection for the balance of the year, we plan to be opportunistic in evaluating whether refinancing our remaining debt is the right course of action or whether we should let the quarters ahead play themselves out, particularly given the range of opinions about where interest rates and market liquidity might be 12 months from now. Elsewhere on the balance sheet, in reviewing our preferred stock derivative liability, primarily due to higher market discount rates, this quarter, we recorded a lower valuation of the liability, generating a noncash gain of $1.4 million. We backed that market adjustment out of our non-GAAP calculations of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS.Our adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter is a loss of $1.44, down from a gain of $0.14 from Q4 2021. Full year adjusted diluted EPS was $4.28 compared to $2.59 for full year 2021. The Quarterly EPS is calculated based on a basic share count of 9.7 million. Year-to-date EPS is calculated based on a diluted share count of 10.2 million. And in aggregate, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $12.1 million versus a gain of $5 million last year. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was $76.4 million or 9.6% of net sales compared to $49.2 million and 7.9% of net sales in 2021.And now back to Stephen for some additional remarks.Stephen G. BermanThank you, John. I want to turn now to talk about some of the key areas we're focusing on this year. In our action figure and collectibles business, we are extremely excited about the new Super Mario Bros movie from Illumination and Nintendo Launching in theaters, April 5. The team has created an entirely new 5-inch scale with greater articulation in conjunction with the movie, along with micro figures and play sets and a 7-inch fire-breathing browser. All that product and more is hitting shelves now. We are extremely excited for fans to see the movie and the product. And our experience with Sonic the Hedgehog is an indication the entertainment will bring new fans into the franchise to discover both our movie products, as well as our deep catalog of Super Mario toys we've been building for several recent years. We are expecting some great things with Nintendo this year. That's not to say, we have forgotten about Sonic in the slightest. The new Sonic Prime episodic programming started on Netflix in December and has been a great success. We have related products launching this fall, coordinated with an additional drop of content. We were really pleased with the Sonic's performance in Q4 and how the product line will continue to expand this year, supported by new content development. And this team, in particular, is always aggressively looking out for new opportunities, which at this point would be 2024 and beyond, but watch the space for more news here.Our Dolls, Role Play and Dress Up segment is coming off a massive year, led by growth in Disney's Encanto, Disney Princess Dress-Up and the Disney Princess Style Collection. For those of you that know the business, we have some difficult comps year-over-year in this area. but there are many new initiatives bringing new news and energy to these aisles at retail.In Q1, we partnered with Walmart to exclusively launch our latest new IP, Ami Amis, a new collectible plush line that is inspired by the trend of yarn and (inaudible). This is a broad collection of soft and cozy characters that personify all of collector's favorite things. Every collectible has a sweet little personality that is described on their hangtag and found in their product details. The odd factor of this product is really off the charts, and we've been hiding it from the world into our lease last month. Its distribution will begin to go wider in the second half of this year, and we are eager to see the reaction to what the team has put together over the past year.Our Disney business is working on to support Disney 100 celebrating 100 years of the Walt Disney Company. This 18-month celebration commenced December 26 and runs through June 2024. Each month, Disney will celebrate a key franchise every month. Disney's Encanto was a focus in February. We have created exclusive Disney 100 products for top U.S. customers as part of their respective programs to celebrate this milestone. We'll be sharing more about the Disney-100 celebration throughout the year and are obviously extremely proud to be part of such a large cultural event. As we mentioned last quarter, we have new product lines launching in support of 2 Disney theatrical releases this year. Coming in May is Disney's, the Little Mermaid Live Action retelling the beloved animated story. Leveraging the new art styles, icons and designs from the movie, we have dress-up, role play, toys and large dolls inspired by the film. We are extremely excited in Thanksgiving's release window as Disney's animations wish, exploring how the iconic Wishing Star came to be. As Disney's 100 immerses its fans around the world and the magic of Disney all year, this is a great foundational cornerstone release launching during the holiday season.Our Disney Ily Large Doll remains on the end cap it target in the U.S. and continues to get great reaction in the 18-inch stall space. International expansion of this line continues to 2023, and later this year, we're bringing the brand to fashion doll scale. So stay tuned for more details about that launch. The effect of the supply chain disruptions and freight cost increases of late 2021 and 2022 impacted the seasonal business, particularly more in 2022. The input cost of bulk-sized products and resulting freight costs of activity tables, ball pits and ride-ons led to price increases to consumers with slow down POS and contributed to the overall shipments being down year-over-year.With freight costs closer to pre-pandemic levels, we are looking to stabilize the seasonal business in these core segments, as well as grow the reduced skateboard business and expand action sports with in-line rollerskates.Moving on to our Disguise costume business. Q1 marks the first full year of holding the Disney license in Europe, and we are really pleased with how the business is developing. Adding those rights has provided us with more scale, enabling greater investment in local resources to tailor our product offerings to the local taste and requirements and also provide the right level of service and attention to costume buyers. Back in North America, some of our customers got a bit ahead of themselves in 2022, saying a high hurdle for this year. But overall, the trajectory of this global business looks great.From a seasonality perspective, certainly, there's a lot of talk about the economy, retail inventories and the mindset of the consumer. We are extremely comfortable with where we are with respect to our peers and are looking forward to the highlights I just mentioned and pushing forward some other initiatives that we have in the works. We do agree that 2023 will return the toy industry to its more normal traditional heavy second half focus than what we've experienced the past few years. We had tremendous POS in the first half of last year as we changed demand on a couple of our larger businesses performing at a higher level than one would reasonably plan for. As we remained very much FOB first company, we still expect the first half of the year to be material for us. Although it's a new year, we continue to focus on the basics of our business, working closely with our factories to ensure we are securing the best prices and on-time deliveries. Working with our customers and licensing partners to develop the right promotional programs to generate robust sell-throughs for this year's products while we simultaneously develop next years.And lastly, we are always talking to everyone all the time about brand-new product line extensions and opportunities to continue to layer on the newness and excitement that our business requires. We look forward to updating you during the year about our progress and appreciate your continued support and interest.One final point before we move on to questions. Our company is focused on expanding its global distribution network. We have been methodically building out our international structure and teams for long-term growth in both mature and underdeveloped markets. This has been rewarded with steady increases in our international sales over the past several years. In order to further that growth, I'm extremely pleased to announce that effective January 1, 2024, our Chief Operating Officer, Jack McGrath, will move full time to our U.K. office and assume the role of President of European operations. We anticipate that this will augment the coordination of our U.S. and international initiatives and help us achieve our fullest market potential. We are confident that Jack will use his many years of experience with our U.S. operations to take advantage of the opportunities for appropriate expansion of our international footprint. This restructuring has been the works for some time as we have plans to reassign his current responsibilities to the appropriate leaders of other departments. There is no intention to backfill the corporate COO position at this time.With that, we will now take questions. Operator?OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference back to CEO, Stephen Berman for closing remarks.Stephen G. BermanThank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have a lineup of calls after this one. So we appreciate everyone that we're on the call today and who will be speaking to after this call. And we look forward to talking to you after our first quarter is completed and during our first quarter earnings. Thank you again.OperatorAnd this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Yahoo Finance's own Allie Canal is here with her vibe check on the call, those key takeaways. Give us the vibe check first. What did you think?ALEXANDRA CANAL: The vibe check, I would say it was generally positive. And that's because I do think, although we don't have all the answers to all the problems at Disney right now, I do think Bob Iger set a very clear tone of where he wants to take the company. He did touch on quite a few topics, from succession plans to what will be key to profitability. My top three takeaways, though, centered around pricing, Hulu, and ESPN+.On the topic of pricing, Iger did make it clear that right now Disney+ is probably a little too cheap. He said it's very easy for consumers to jump around to different streaming services, and although he is very proconsumer, rationalizing that pricing strategy will be a key driver when it comes to profitability. Here's a bit more of what he had to say about that.BOB IGER: Obviously we have to attract more subs, but I think one of the key things that we have to figure out is a pricing strategy that makes sense. I think in our zeal to grow global subs, I think we were off in terms of that pricing strategy, and we're now starting to learn more about it and to adjust accordingly.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Keep a lookout for any possible pricing updates there over the next few quarters.Another thing he also discussed was Hulu, and basically the future of Hulu, it's TBD. Disney controls 2/3 of the streaming giant. Comcast controls the rest, and a decision will need to be made by January 2024 per that contract. So will they keep? Will they sell? Right now, all options are on the table. Take a listen.Story continuesBOB IGER: So it's a solid platform, and it's also a very attractive platform for advertisers. It's already proven to be valuable for them, and advertising has proven to be valuable for us. But the environment is very, very tricky right now, and before we make any big decisions about our level of investment, our commitment to that business, we want to understand where it could go.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So a more strategic approach to Hulu relative to that macro environment.And then finally, very similar to Hulu, the murky future of ESPN, ESPN+. That has long been debated by investors, but Iger remained confident that the ESPN brand is a strong one. Take a listen.BOB IGER: Down the road at some point, I think it's inevitable because of what's happening in media and the world and technology. It will become a direct-to-consumer business. And when you give-- when you combine the strength of live sports and the brand and the value of advertising so that you can create a business that's not just subscriber dependent but dependent on advertising and subscriber revenue, I think there's a reason to be bullish.ALEXANDRA CANAL: There you have it. He did say he's open minded to ESPN's future, so potentially at some point maybe Disney could spin off the network or maybe sell just a stake in it. But from judging these comments and especially the fact that Disney recently restructured the business-- ESPN is its own standalone unit-- I don't think that's happening any time soon.But Iger, he's just this force when he speaks. He's very clear, and he also demonstrated that he's willing to pivot depending on what's going around in the environment and the streaming wars.DAVE BRIGGS: Let me ask you just your opinion. Does separating, siloing ESPN allow them maybe an easier path to embrace sports gambling? Because that has been begged for by investors.ALEXANDRA CANAL: He did mention sports gambling. He said right now there are no current opportunities, but he thinks it's inevitable that at some point sports programming and sports betting have to be intertwined. He even talked about his two younger sons. He's like, I don't really want them to get into sports betting right now, but I know that's something they're interested, and--DAVE BRIGGS: They're already doing it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I know, right? He's like-- that's what he basically said. And he said for younger consumers, this is important. But that has always been the argument, right? If you separate ESPN, maybe that makes the sports betting a little easier.DAVE BRIGGS: More palatable because they're not attached to Mickey Mouse.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right. Exactly.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that's the perception.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But look, he didn't come out and say absolutely not, so I guess we'll see.SEANA SMITH: Sounds like it might be on the table. All right, Allie Canal, thanks so much.]"

He said he hopes to embrace a more curated HBO-like approach of making a few high-quality shows built around its major brands, as he works to lift Disney+ to a profit.""As we look to reduce the content that we're creating for our own platforms, there probably are opportunities to license to third parties,"" Iger said. ""For a while, that was something we couldn't possibly do because we were so favoring our own streaming platforms. But if we get to a point where we need less content for these platforms, and we still have the capacity of producing that content, why not use it to grow revenue?""Iger also talked about the possibility of licensing content to third parties, noting that Seth MacFarlane's animated series ""Family Guy"" drew viewers on Disney-owned Hulu after the shows originally aired on the Fox network.Iger returned to Disney in November, less than a year after he retired, as the entertainment company sought to boost investor confidence and profits at its streaming media unit.The company announced a sweeping restructuring in February, saying it would eliminate 7,000 jobs as part of an effort to save $5.5 billion in costs and return power to Disney's creative executives.The plan promoted activist investor Nelson Peltz to end his quest for a board seat, saying he was happy with Iger's restructuring.(This story has been corrected to remove reference to Roku in paragraph 4)(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)]"

PDS.Industry: Oil &amp; Gas - DrillingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2063364/3-oil-gas-drilling-stocks-to-make-it-through-macro-headwindsThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry has lately been pegged back by the impending end to their legacy high-margin contracts, uncertainties related to slowing global economic growth and inflationary pressures. Although macro challenges are leading to some moderation in activity, we think the space still has fuel left in the tank, especially for the operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. We advise investors to focus on Helmerich &amp; Payne, Nabors Industries and Precision Drilling Corp.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry consists of companies that provide rigs (or specialized vehicles) on a contractual basis to explore and develop oil and gas. These operators offer drilling rigs (both land-based/onshore and offshore), equipment, services and manpower to exploration and production companies worldwide.Drilling for hydrocarbons is costly and technically difficult, and its future primarily depends on contracting activity and the total number of available rigs at a given time rather than the price of oil or gas. Within the industry, it's interesting to note that the volatility associated with offshore drilling companies is much higher than their onshore counterparts and their share prices are more correlated to the price of oil. Overall, the drilling stocks are among the most volatile in the entire equity market.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Drilling Industry's FutureConcerns About Economic Growth: Most energy companies (including the drilling operators) have been experiencing rising costs in the form of increased expenses related to maintenance and inventory. The inflationary environment, together with supply-chain tightness, is not only pushing costs higher but also affecting their capital programs.Story continuesApart from being hard to ignore, escalation in expenses is also drowning out the benefits of any commodity price increase. In our view, the inflation-associated headwinds will continue to challenge growth and margin numbers with little chance of a quick resolution.Finally, what this means is that the central banks will be persistent with their aggressive policy of raising rates to stem inflation. This may lead to a rough road for oil/gas equities. In particular, worries about weaker energy demand due to the threat of recession (spurred by rising interest rates and slowing consumer spending) might jeopardize the commodity’s ascent.Rig Count on the Move: Oil and natural gas prices have rebounded sharply, revisiting their multi-year highs last year due to rising demand and geopolitical tensions surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Consequently, drilling activity has been picking up in North America, a region on which most drillers are highly dependent.As a matter of fact, the rig count in early March was 995 compared with 867 a year ago, in sync with the relative stability in commodity prices. The number of active units in the international market has gained sharply too. The steady growth in rig count is an encouraging indicator of drilling activity.Wind-Down of Legacy, High-Margin Contracts: For most operators, order levels have remained depressed, and day rates are trending just above cash costs despite the strong rebound in commodity prices. This has put increasing pressure on their revenue-generating capacity. Further, as the companies’ legacy, high-margin contracts wind down slowly, the drillers are faced with the prospect of a drop in backlog (and consequently, revenues), which is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters. This also leaves the drillers vulnerable to addressing their massive debt maturities and investment in newbuilds.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is a 9-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #201, which places it in the bottom 20% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates challenging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are becoming pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. While the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have gone down 20.3% so far this year, the same for 2024 have fallen 10.3% over the same timeframe.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 12.1% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 4.7%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 6%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas drilling companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 17.09X, higher than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.07X. It is also well above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.02X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.76X, as low as 7.28X, with a median of 12.39X.3 Oil and Gas - Drilling Stocks to WatchHelmerich &amp; Payne: Helmerich &amp; Payne is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States &amp; internationally. Its technologically advanced FlexRigs are much in demand. The company has already upgraded most of its drilling fleet with the latest technology.Besides, Helmerich &amp; Payne boasts a strong balance sheet, carrying just $543 million in long-term debt, with a low debt-to-capitalization of 16.5% compared with many of its peers that are hugely burdened with debts, accounting for around 50% of their total capital structure. With available liquidity surpassing debt levels and a lack of significant near-term maturities, Helmerich &amp; Payne should sail through any difficult operating environment.The fiscal 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Tulsa, OK-based company indicates 4,580% earnings per share growth over fiscal 2022. The provider of land and offshore rigs carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its shares have edged up 3% in a year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nabors Industries: Nabors is one of the largest land-drilling contractors in the world, conducting oil, gas and geothermal land-drilling operations. NBR is well positioned with a sound mix of high-performance rigs and new rigs working in key shale plays like Bakken and Permian. Nabors’ initiatives to expand its geographic reach and diversify its operating assets beyond land rigs bode well for its Rig Technologies and Drilling Solutions segments. Tesco Corporation, Robotic Drilling Systems and PetroMar's buyout have boosted the drilling operations and technology of Nabors, adding to the company's earnings and shareholder value.The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Hamilton, Bermuda-based company indicates 149.6% earnings per share growth over 2022. NBR currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The stock has lost 5.7% in a year.Precision Drilling: This #3 Ranked company is Canada’s largest drilling rig contractor. A provider of rentals, wellsite accommodations/catering and snubbing services, Calgary-headquartered Precision Drilling has active operations in the United States, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. In particular, PDS’ market-leading Alpha digital technology portfolio provides it with a competitive edge. A tight rig market, together with strength in the company’s activity levels should result in higher dayrates and an improving contract book. Precision Drilling’s prudent cost management and technological leadership are its other growth drivers.The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for PDS indicates 699.5% earnings per share growth over 2022. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings twice in the trailing four quarters. Precision Drilling stock has lost 8.8% in a year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

If you want to see more best stocks under $100, go directly to 5 Best Stocks Under $100.Stocks are very uncertain in the short term as pretty much anything can happen. Earnings can be better than expected or they can be worse than expected. Individual news events can also be better than expected or worse than expected.Currently, the market is pretty uncertain.On March 7, one news event negatively affected the market with the S&amp;P 500 declining by 1.53% to below 4000. On March 7, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.""As a result, the peak level of interest rates could be higher than previously expected. If interest rates rise too much, the economy, while currently expanding, could slow or even contract.If the economy slows substantially enough, overall corporate earnings could decline. If earnings decline too much, there could be more of a headwind for the overall stock market.While the short term is uncertain, the odds are still good that in the long term many blue chip companies with substantial competitive advantages can generate fairly decent returns.Many blue chip companies are profitable and return excess capital through dividends. For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.Many blue chip companies that are profitable also buy back stock as another way of returning capital back to shareholders. If they buy back more stock than they issue and their earnings either stays the same or increases, the buybacks will help their EPS growth.Owning one blue chip is not a high probability way of benefiting from market growth in the long term however. Management of blue chips could make a bad acquisition for instance, or they might position their company incorrectly in an important field. As a result, the overall return of an individual blue chip might not do as well in the long term even though the company has numerous competitive advantages.Story continuesOne potential way to avoid that is to have a well diversified portfolio of leading blue chip stocks across many different sectors and holding for the long term.Energy, electricity, industryPhoto by Matthew Henry on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best Stocks Under $100, we selected 15 blue chip stocks with competitive advantages that had stock prices under $100 as of the close of March 7, 2023.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.15 Best Stocks Under $10015.

272,9103c7de-bcd0-30db-9eda-fc5bcefbdeaf,CL,2023-03-10,7 Dividend Kings to Buy for an Uncertain Market Environment,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-kings-buy-uncertain-215135011.html,1678139495,STORY,"['ABBV', 'JNJ', 'NWN', 'PG', 'KO', 'SYY', 'ABT', 'CL']","[Though the term dividend aristocrats generate plenty of interest for the underlying elite status, another even more rarefied category exists called dividend kings to buy. Rather than 25 years of consecutive payout growth, the kings command at least 50 years. As we head into uncertain times, investors should pay close attention to this rare group of enterprises.Fundamentally, of course, companies that can afford to provide passive income to their stakeholders tend to be deeply established businesses. Should unexpected turbulence hit the market, they’re likelier to ride out the turmoil compared to growth-centric organizations. Therefore, dividend kings to buy deserve serious consideration for your portfolio. In addition, these elites of elite firms will want to keep the trend going at any cost. Naturally, you don’t want to be the person responsible for a 50-plus-year track record being broken. Thus, you’re in reasonably good hands with these dividend kings to buy.ABBVAbbVie$155.28CLColgate-Palmolive$73.29PGProcter &amp; Gamble$140.35NWNNorthwest Natural$47.41KOCoca-Cola$60.36SYYSYSCO$76.35JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$155.56InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAbbVie (ABBV)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comA top-flight pharmaceutical firm, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) ranks among the most intriguing dividend kings to buy. According to Dividend.com, the company features 51 years of consecutive payout growth. Now, it’s worth pointing out for clarification that AbbVie spun off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2012. Therefore, Dividend.com tracks the history to Abbott, not to the 2012 spinoff date.Now, either way, I don’t think you can go wrong. For Abbott, the company might be undervalued relative to forward earnings. In AbbVie’s case, it too may be undervalued. For instance, the market prices ABBV at a forward multiple of 13.66. As a discount to earnings, AbbVie ranks better than 60.16% of the competition.Story continuesFundamentally, AbbVie’s buyout of Allergan – the manufacturer of Botox – could pay off handsomely. As people return to the office, a greater incentive exists to look presentable. That should help Botox and in turn ABBV stock. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ABBV as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $163.64, implying 6% upside potential.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comOne of the top manufacturers of household goods, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) commands attention for the underlying toothpaste. According to Divdend.com, the enterprise features 60 years of consecutive dividend growth. Further, it carries a forward yield of 2.57%. In contrast, the underlying consumer staples sector’s average yield sits at 1.89%. Finally, its payout ratio is 55.23, reflecting a reasonably sustainable passive income.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), CL rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, Colgate-Palmolive’s greatest strengths lie in its profitability metrics. Perhaps most notably, its operating margin stands at 19.77%, outpacing 90.77% of the field. As well, its net margin pings at 9.93%, above nearly 80% of the industry.Further, while it could use a little bit of improvement in the balance sheet, Colgate-Palmolive’s Altman Z-Score is 6.43. This indicates a very low risk of bankruptcy over the next two years. Lastly, covering analysts peg CL as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target is $79.70, implying 8% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the steady dividend kings to buy.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWith so many rumblings in the market and in the broader global economy, consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) simply makes sense. However, the enterprise’s status as one of the dividend kings to buy makes PG all the more attractive. Presently, Procter &amp; Gamble commands 67 years of consecutive payout growth. As well, its forward yield stands at 2.61%. Again, this ranks conspicuously higher than the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%.According to Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations, PG rates as fairly valued. Objectively, it might be a tough overvalued. However, this is really an organization built for the long haul. For instance, the consumer goods stalwart features an Altman Z-Score of 5.06, implying low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, PG enjoys a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 31.2%, outpacing 82% of the field. However, it’s again the profitability that drives the case for PG as one of the dividend kings to buy. Its net margin stands at 17.79%, above nearly 92% of the industry.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target is $157.48, implying almost 13% upside potential.Northwest Natural (NWN)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Portland, Oregon, Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN) provides natural gas service to approximately 2.5 million people in Oregon and southwest Washington. As a public utility, Northwest enjoys a natural monopoly. Because of the scale involved and the high barrier to entry, it’s doubtful that anyone can usurp Northwest.Cynically, then, NWN makes for an enticing opportunity among dividend kings to buy. Currently, the utility commands 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, its forward yield stands at 4.06%. In contrast, the utility sector’s average yield is 3.75%. Now, one factor to keep in mind is that Northwest’s payout ratio of just under 70% is a bit high. Still, no one’s going to want to give up the dividend king status. Also, for full transparency, Northwest doesn’t offer wow-factor financials. However, Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations rate NWN as modestly undervalued.Finally, covering analysts peg NWN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $54.33, implying almost 14% upside potential.Coca-Cola (KO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comProbably the world’s most famous soft-drink manufacturer, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) needs no introduction. Not only does it represent a blue-chip giant, it effectively symbolizes American capitalism. From this angle, it’s not terribly surprising that KO ranks among the dividend kings to buy.Right now, the iconic enterprise features 62 years of consecutive payout growth. As well, the company’s fairly generous with its passive income, carrying a forward yield of 3.08%. Again, in contrast, the consumer staples sector’s average yield is 1.89%. While I wouldn’t fret about the sustainability of the yield, prospective investors should note the payout ratio of 65.82%.At the present juncture, Gurufocus.com rates KO as fairly valued. However, patient investors may be able to advantage of Coca-Cola’s operational strengths. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 4.6% while its net margin hit 22.19%. Both stats rate into the top tier of the underlying industry. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg KO as a consensus strong buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $68.33, implying over 14% upside potential.SYSCO (SYY)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, SYSCO (NYSE:SYY) specializes in marketing and distributing food products, small wares, kitchen equipment, and tabletop items to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, and hospitality businesses. Given its vast relevancies, it makes for an attractive idea among dividend kings to buy. Specifically, Sysco commands 54 years of consecutive dividend increases.In addition, it offers a forward yield of 2.59%. I’m not going to repeat it but it’s higher than the underlying consumer staples sector. Also, it should be stated that the payout ratio sits at 42.68%. While it’s not the lowest figure in the world, no one should worry excessively about yield sustainability. Gurufocus.com rates SYY as modestly undervalued. Objectively, Sysco’s greatest strengths lie in its profitability-related metrics. For instance, its return on asset (ROA) pings at 6.45%, outpacing 77% of the competition.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SYY as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $88.15, implying nearly 17% upside potential.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA consumer goods and healthcare giant, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) represents one of the world’s most recognizable brands. As well, with so many events seemingly spiraling out of control globally, JNJ just seems like a smart bet overall. Tack on the fact that it’s one of the dividend kings to buy and you have a very compelling bullish case.At the moment, Johnson &amp; Johnson features 61 years of consecutive payout growth. In addition, the company carries a forward yield of 2.91%. In contrast, the healthcare sector’s average yield sits at 1.58%. Also noteworthy is the payout ratio, which pings at 41.5%. At this rate, investors can sleep a little easier when it comes to yield sustainability. Financially, the company’s greatest strengths lie in its profitability metrics. Notably, its net margin hit 18.9%, blowing past 87% of the industry. Plus, the company’s Altman Z-Score is 4.01, reflecting low bankruptcy risk.Lastly, covering analysts peg JNJ as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $183.10, implying 20% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

273,a32ec0aa-c0ee-33a4-8b22-39744a762f69,JNPR,2023-03-10,Qualcomm (QCOM) Hikes Quarterly Dividend on Solid Cash Flow,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-qcom-hikes-quarterly-dividend-143602075.html,1678372562,STORY,"['QCOM', 'ANET', 'JNPR']","[Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM recently announced a 7% year-over-year hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 80 cents per share or $3.20 on an annualized basis. The news seemed to have struck the right chords with investors as share prices rose 1.7% to close at $121.20 yesterday.Based on the closing price, as of Mar 8, the proposed dividend affirms a yield of 2.6%. A steady dividend payout is part of the long-term strategy of Qualcomm to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. In addition, healthy dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of its strengths.The current hike reflects the inherent financial strength of the company and the strong cash flow generated from continued focus on high-margin businesses and healthy execution of operating plans. Qualcomm generated $3,095 million of net cash from operating activities in first-quarter fiscal 2023 compared with $2,057 million a year ago. At quarter-end, the company had $4,808 million in cash and cash equivalents.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, the chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches.The company is well-positioned to benefit from solid 5G traction with greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream to meet its long-term revenue targets. Qualcomm is witnessing strong demand in emerging product categories such as XR and wearables, along with 4G and 5G mobile broadband devices and rapid adoption of Wi-Fi 6. It is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. This augurs well for the long-term growth proposition of the company.The buyout of Veoneer, Inc. offers Qualcomm a firmer footing in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology as it aims to extend the Snapdragon Ride Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) portfolio. The Arriver business of Veoneer operates the dedicated software unit focused on sensor perception and drive policy, including a full stack of features and functions.With the acquisition, Qualcomm has incorporated Arriver's Computer Vision, Drive Policy and Driver Assistance assets into its ADAS portfolio to deliver an open and competitive platform for automakers to better compete with rivals within the self-driving vehicle market. This, in turn, is likely to augment its automotive business as it strives to boost revenues beyond chipmaking for the smartphone market.All these positive drivers and sound financial management probably led to the quarterly dividend hike.Shares of the company have lost 21.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQualcomm presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s wireless and fiber test solutions are in the early stages of a multi-year investment cycle, fueled by the transition of OEMs and service providers to superfast 5G networks. The healthy growth traction is further demonstrated by the upside in wireless &amp; fiber test, 3D sensing products, optical transport, Ethernet, broadband access, video test and storage network testing markets.The 5G transition is expected to be disruptive in nature, potentially creating new avenues for industries across the board. 5G is likely to augment the telecommunications industry's scalability, security and universal mobility, thus propelling the proliferation of IoT. Telecom firms are enabling customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations. They are ensuring seamless migration to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation. The convergence of network technologies requires significant investments from traditional carriers (telecom and cable) and cloud service providers. Viavi’s solutions are well-positioned to meet these rapidly changing industry trends, given its technology prowess, product depth and wide customer base.Viavi engages in targeted restructuring activities to consolidate its operations and better align businesses with evolving market conditions and investment strategies. The company pursues a holistic growth model with strategic acquisitions and focused organic improvement plans. Of late, the OSP (Optical Security and Performance Products) segment has been benefiting from strong demand for 3D sensing and anti-counterfeiting products. The company expects to leverage major secular growth trends in 5G wireless, fiber and 3D sensing to achieve higher revenues and profitability with greater flexibility in the capital structure.Demand for sophisticated anti-counterfeiting features, which consumers can easily validate without using special tools but are difficult to create or simulate using conventional printing technology, has led to the exponential growth of Viavi’s OSP segment.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Also be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Andrea Daley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Andrea Daley: Thank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me for today's call is Simon Campion, Dentsply Sirona, Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Coleman, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's call, we may make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.Our most recently filed Form 10-K and any updating information in subsequent SEC filings, lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Additionally, on today's call, our remarks will be based on non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information, about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results.Story continuesAnd with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Simon.Simon Campion: Thank you, Andrea, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our Q4 2022 earnings call. Today, I'll start by providing an overview of our recent performance and the transformation work we have underway. Glenn will cover Q4 and 2022 financial results and also share our 2023 outlook, and then I will finish by providing a strategic operating update. Starting on slide 5. We were pleased to close out 2022 with results much better than expected, exceeding the high end of our prior outlook across key financial metrics. Having led this organization for five months now, I'm energized by the momentum we have and confident that while the macro environment remains challenging, the difficult work we are doing now will aid our ability to navigate it successfully.We are already seeing the fruits of our efforts with early quick wins such as renewed interest from and with DSOs. While we can't get into the details, it gives us confidence in the progress that we are already making. You may have heard that, we recently announced our organizational restructuring plan to improve operational performance to increase alignment, to drive process and discipline, and to begin to position Dentsply Sirona for improved future performance. We committed to act with urgency, and I feel we are doing just that. We are moving deliberately from discovery to action, and we are confident that this plan and other initiatives will collectively improve performance to deliver long-term shareholder value. Moving to slide 6. Let me take a few minutes to explain the changes we are making.We are putting into place a new operating model, which will enable the company to better deliver on our strategic objectives while also focusing on our tone at the top that focuses on inclusivity, transparency and importantly, ethics and compliance. The plan consists of the following elements: number one, reducing the global workforce by approximately 8% to 10% while continuing to invest in the global commercial organizations. Number two, implementation of five global business units reporting into one leader, the global business units are designed to drive enterprise integration align our product portfolio to the Company's growth strategy and to drive seamless communication with our commercial teams. Number three, commencement of central functions and infrastructure optimization to support the efficiency of the overall organization.Number four, hiring a new leader of quality and regulatory to sit on the leadership team, thus elevating the visibility and importance of this critical function within the organization. Number five, simplification of management structure to bring the company in line with industry best practices; and number six, delivering cost savings to fund critical investments in 2023 and beyond to position the company for sustainable future growth. As summarized on slide 7, we expect to achieve at least $200 million in annual cost savings over the next 18 months. And as outlined already, reduced the global workforce by up to 10% of the total employee base but we are not targeting our sales teams. We believe that this plan, along with other actions we have underway will set Dentsply Sirona on the right path to deliver better and more consistent results and, in turn, create significant value for all our stakeholders.The members of the leadership team have undertaken such work in their respective paths. So this experience, coupled with the partnership of external firms who bring an independent view, industry benchmarking and best practice is benefiting this work. This transformational work is particularly difficult when actions impact our team, and therefore, we have not taken these decisions lightly. We have very talented employees and the leadership team is confident that the changes we are making will unite to the organization for better position Dentsply Sirona for long-term sustainable success. Importantly, we are becoming a more inclusive organization focused on creating and fostering a culture of authenticity, compliance and accountability. This starts with having leaders at the top, who will provide the right tone and foster the right culture, and I feel that this change in tone within the organization is beginning to resonate with our employees.The most recent North American sales force engagement survey, for example, highlights meaningful arguably significant improvement across the board. In addition to the positive employee momentum, we're also seeing it with our customers globally by leveraging the strength of our clinical education programs. We recently hosted our first-ever DS World, Dubai with more than 800 registered attendees from 47 countries. This was our fourth DS World event in the last six months and enables us to interact with more than 7,000 dental professionals. Before I turn it over to Glenn to discuss the financial performance, let me reiterate that we want to be a company that fulfills our commitments internally and externally, and I feel that the increased engagement we are seeing internally and externally is helping us establish a pathway to be that company.Glenn?stockyimages/Shutterstock.comGlenn Coleman: Thank you, Simon. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'll cover several topics, including our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results as well as our outlook for 2023. Overall, we exceeded the high end of our revenue, operating margin and adjusted EPS outlook ranges that we provided in November and believe this is an important early milestone as we move forward. So let's begin on Slide 9. Our fourth quarter revenue was $983 million, which represented a decline of 10.9% on a reported basis versus the prior year, largely impacted by foreign currency and a stronger US dollar. Organic sales decreased by 2.6%, but if exclude China, sales grew 0.4%. Sequentially, organic revenue grew 5.8% versus Q3.Operating income was $154 million with operating margin of 15.7%. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin contracted due to continued FX and inflation headwinds, partially offset by price. On a sequential basis versus the third quarter, operating margin improved by 100 basis points, which was much better than expected. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.46 and exceeded the high end of our outlook range by $0.09, largely due to better-than-expected organic revenues and operating margin performance. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EPS declined by $0.37. We attribute about $0.10 of the EPS decline to foreign currency, with the remainder coming from lower year-over-year organic revenues, inflationary pressures and below-the-line FX expenses.We also delivered strong operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, which came in at $142 million, translating to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 110%, up from 100% conversion in the prior year. In the quarter, we returned $26 million to shareholders through dividends. Let me now turn to our segment performance in the quarter on Slide 10. Organic sales in Technologies &amp; Equipment, or our T&amp;E segment declined 2.2%, while the consumables segment declined 3.4%. The T&amp;E organic sales decline was primarily due to softer implants volume, partially offset by continued strong demand for aligners. Aligners grew over 25% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in both SureSmile and Byte. This quarter was the second quarter in a row with double-digit growth in this part of our business.SureSmile continues to benefit from regional expansion, particularly in Europe and new product offerings. Our direct-to-consumer aligner brand, Byte also saw a very strong growth despite slowing consumer spending trends as we're seeing improvement in customer conversion rates. Our CAD/CAM business also returned to growth in Q4, driven by strong demand in Japan and Korea. The Equipment &amp; Instruments business declined by low single digits in the quarter, driven by softening demand and ongoing supply chain constraints. Implants were down double digits versus the prior year quarter due to softer demand in China as well as in the US and Europe. We did see some positives in parts of our implants business as value implants showed year-over-year growth.Moving to the Consumables segment. Organic sales declined primarily due to lower volume in China. These headwinds were partially offset by modest price increases and recent product launches, including ProTaper Ultimate and CEREC blocks and growth in restorative and preventative products. Excluding China, the Consumables segment grew approximately 1% organically over the prior year fourth quarter. Now, let's turn to slide 11 to discuss fourth quarter financial performance by region. US sales were $369 million, representing an organic sales decline of 1.7%, driven by lower volume in CAD/CAM, implants and lab consumables. These headwinds were partially offset by strong growth in aligners. While CAD/CAM volume was down in the quarter, dealer inventory levels were also reduced by $30 million sequentially.Turning to Europe. Sales of $376 million were down 3.2% on an organic basis due to lower implants and equipment volume. We attribute the softness in equipment to continued supply constraints, as well as a weaker retail demand environment. Rest of World sales were $238 million and down 3% on an organic basis versus the prior year. In China, as expected, we experienced lower sales across product groups due to COVID shutdowns, as well as headwinds in implants due to the impact of VBP. Excluding China, Rest of World organic sales had a very strong quarter and grew double digits. Moving to slide 12, let me now cover our full year 2022 performance. In 2022, sales were $3.9 billion, representing an organic sales decline of 0.5%. Sales in the year were significantly impacted by foreign currency headwinds, supply chain constraints and regional softness in China and the US, with the US decline largely due to reductions in CAD/CAM dealer inventory.Despite these headwinds, we are pleased by our performance in Europe, which grew 3% on an organic basis and Rest of World, excluding China, which grew 10%. Notably, our global aligners business, which is a key growth area for the company grew nearly 10% over the prior year. Operating margin for the full year was 16.8%, which exceeded our outlook of margin greater than 15%. As compared to full year 2021, operating margin contracted 350 basis points due to lower volume, unfavorable mix, inflation and foreign exchange headwinds, which was partially offset by price. For the full year, foreign exchange headwinds impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. We delivered full year EPS of $2.09 or $2.44 excluding the impact of FX, compared to $2.82 in the prior year.The company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and finished the year with $365 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.1 times. For the year, we returned approximately 70% of free cash flow to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases. And today, we announced a 12% increase to our dividend. This represents three consecutive years of double-digit increases to the dividend and signifies our confidence in our long-term plans. With that, let's now move to slide 14 to discuss our expectations for 2023. Overall, we're reviewing 2023 as a transition year. Significant work is underway to improve the company and fix the internal issues, structure and processes that have hindered recent results and this work will position the company to drive significant shareholder value when the external environment improves.With that said, we have a credible plan for 2023 that includes cost savings and much needed investments to create and sustain long-term profitable growth in the business. For the full year 2023, we expect organic sales to be in the range of down 1% to up 2%, which represents a net sales range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. Based on current rates, FX will be a 100 basis point headwind to full year net sales. On an FX-neutral basis, we expect the cadence of sales to be fairly balanced over the year with sales slightly larger in the second half of the year as compared to the first half. We anticipate that demand will remain strong in key strategic growth areas. Aligners will continue to benefit from regional expansion and market share gains, and we expect better performance in implants.We also anticipate, an uplift recently launched CAD/CAM products, including Primeprint, DS Core and Primescan Connect, but we remain cautious on overall equipment demand. Turning to regional dynamics. We expect to see an improvement in the two geographies that were a challenge in 2022, the US and China. In Q4, we made critical investments to our US commercial team, which will continue in the first half of 2023. We also enhanced our commission plans to incentivize growth and address the higher CAD/CAM dealer inventory levels. We expect that, these actions will enable our US business to return to growth in 2023, starting in the first quarter. In China, we expect sales will be flat on an organic basis after a year of significant decline in 2022, but we remain cautious on the demand outlook as significant near-term uncertainty remains.Additionally, VBP will be a top line headwind due to the 40% price impact we will see in our China implants business. While many uncertainties remain, we are seeing positive signs of recovery. For example, this week, our China commercial team participated in an in-person dental trade show with 50,000 dental professionals in attendance. As we move forward in 2023, we'll be using EBITDA margin as the primary profitability measure to track our operational performance and better align with our peers. For 2023, we expect our EBITDA margin to be greater than 18% which is a decline of 140 basis points from the prior year, but above our fourth quarter run rate of 17.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 on a full year basis.Let's turn to slide 15 to discuss the puts and takes in our 2023 EPS outlook. Overall, we anticipate that adjusted EPS will decline from $2.09 in 2022 to $1.90 in 2023 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Cost savings from the restructuring plan are expected to accelerate starting in the second quarter, contributing approximately $0.30 of EPS in 2023, with the full run rate achieved by mid-2024. We anticipate a sequential moderation in raw material inflation throughout 2023, but remain at elevated levels. We will offset a portion of the inflation with price increases, which will net to a $0.20 headwind to earnings. Other items than the FX and interest will net to a $0.04 headwind to EPS. This brings us to EPS of $2.15, up $0.06 versus the prior year, excluding the impact of investments.We will be making commercial investments and undertaking long overdue integration activities in 2023. These investments are expected to impact EPS by $0.25. On slide 16, we'll cover the risks and opportunities we see in our outlook. Our outlook is based on our most recent view of the dental market and economy today. Overall, we see 2023 as having a healthy balance of risks and opportunities that could enable outperformance. The largest variable to our outlook is the overall health of the economy. Similar to last year, the external environment remains challenging and uncertainty is high. While demand has been largely stable to-date, we believe that recessionary concerns, rising interest rates and high inflation could lead to a change in consumer behavior, which in turn could cause a slowdown in elective procedures and capital equipment purchases.Beyond the external environment, key opportunities that could drive our performance relative to our outlook include earlier or greater impact from commercial investments and faster sustained supply chain recovery. On the risk side, we acknowledge there is some risk to the timing on realizing savings associated with our organizational restructuring plan. It is a large-scale global program with many variables, which we're closely monitoring as we execute. Turning to slide 17. We've laid out additional details on our expectations for the first quarter, given the visibility that we have at this stage in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect year-over-year organic sales growth to be approximately 1%, driven by continued strong growth in our aligners business and growth in the US offset by continued headwinds in China, which we expect to gradually improve over the remainder of the year.US organic growth will benefit from easier comps in CAD/CAM and the favorable timing of dealer orders. Entering the year, dealer inventory has returned to much lower levels and will be largely aligned to retail sales going forward. Having said that, we do expect dealer CAD/CAM inventory to increase sequentially in Q1 and then return to lower levels over the course of the year. We expect the US quarterly performance to be choppy in 2023 with slight growth for the full year. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we anticipate that FX will continue to be a headwind, negatively impacting net sales in the first quarter by approximately $40 million. We expect EBITDA margins will be at least 15% and will sequentially improve each quarter as the realization of the restructuring plan savings accelerate and we begin to see demand recovery in certain regions.Let me now wrap up on slide 18, and quickly touch on capital allocation priorities. We plan to continue returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends, which we've increased three consecutive years as well as share repurchases. Our capital deployment strategy is predicated on keeping leverage low with flexibility in the balance sheet while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. We have a strong balance sheet, a low leverage ratio and healthy cash flow generation and expect full year 2023 free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, which reflects the expected cash outlays to support our restructuring program. Our goal is to improve conversion to 100% once you move past the one-time cash outlays in 2023 through the organization and portfolio work that we discussed today as well as working capital and supply chain optimization.And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Simon.Simon Campion: Thank you, Glenn. Moving on to our strategic update, starting on Slide 20. We are putting our plans into motion as we move the organization forward to address the internal challenges we have faced and lay the right foundation that will enable long-term sustainable performance. The fundamentals of our industry remain attractive, and we are well placed to capitalize on growth opportunities supported by a solid organizational foundation. Our path forward starts with confirmation that our strategy to transform the industry by digitalizing dental workflows, by driving product and service innovation and delivering an exceptional customer and patient experience through an engaged and diverse workforce is the right one.We are now intensely focused on how we will improve on the delivery of the tactical elements of this strategy in a predictable, repeatable, reliable manner to customers, shareholders and employees. Changing to Slide 21, we have initiated much of this transformational work with heavy lifting is ahead of us. As we embark on this New Year, we are focused on five core tactical and strategic objectives. These objectives are to: number one, deliver on our annual growth and margin commitments that Glenn has just shared. Number two, enhance and sustain our profitability. Number three, accelerate enterprise digitalization. Number four, wind in aligners and implants. And number five, create a high-performance culture. As we make progress on these objectives, we do so with an eye on fulfilling our commitment to return to industry growth and increase profitability.Turning to Slide 22. I would like to reiterate the key actions we are taking to achieve these objectives. Today, we have provided our 2023 growth and margin outlook, and we are committed to achieving that plan. We will do so by making meaningful progress on the other four objectives that we have laid out. Notably, we have discussed in detail the organizational changes we have underway to implement a new operating model, which will enable us to connect segments and geographies, reallocate capital through the company as needed and eliminate silos to improve the customer and employee experience. In parallel, we are defining our winning portfolio. The strategic intent of our winning portfolio will focus on a simple, secure and connected workflow experience that our dental clinic and lab customers trust for better treatment journeys and patient outcomes.Related to our portfolio shaping work, a topic of much discussion has been the future of our Wellspect Healthcare business. I can confirm thus far no final decisions about the ultimate status of the significant and profitable part portfolio have been made, we have received several inbound inquiries about this asset. We feel compelled to investigate such inquiries and have commenced engagements with several interested parties. We will not make any further comments on this matter until we have a definitive conclusion to these discussions. Another key aspect of our winning portfolio involves simplification. We are reviewing the company's product offerings on a SKU level basis to inform the size of actions that can be taken to streamline the portfolio and deliver higher returns.Our early insights indicate that the portfolio is overly complex. For example, we now know that in our consumables business, 12% of the SKUs generate approximately 95% of our revenue in those categories. This complexity adds significant costs to the business and leads to inefficient use of internal resources across functions. Specifically, in Endo, we have over 9, 000 SKUs of different endodontic files with 8% of the SKUs making up 90% of that platforms revenue. While this work is ongoing, we know there is opportunity to simplify and drive improvement in plants and the network efficiencies to unlock further long-term margin expansion. These efforts also yield additional benefits, including reducing operational complexity, optimizing inventory, increasing service levels and sales force effectiveness, reducing risk and improving quality.Importantly, we see these benefits with the goal of preserving the associated revenue through disciplined execution and effective customer partnerships. The comprehensive review of our business has suffered important areas that need strategic investments to drive overdue integration and enable future growth. Key areas for investment include our global sales teams, our IT systems and in resources to ensure compliance. Many of these investments have already commenced, and we have, for example, made great progress on the US sales force expansion. The vast majority are hired and were recently trained in our North America sales meeting. Investments in our IT systems are necessary to modernize our landscape and further our enterprise integration.While these types of large-scale ERP endeavors are typically a multiyear journey requiring land investment, they are critical to the business, operating efficiently and most importantly, being able to deliver for customers in an optimal way. We have commenced the process to understand this transformation over the past number of weeks. Compliance is another critically important area. Investing and compliance will support the remediation plan developed in 2022. Operating with the utmost integrity and in a compliant manner in everything we do, is important to us all on the leadership team and on the Board. As such, this investment has the complete support of both groups and is underway. We are confident that with these actions and in more normalized market conditions, Dentsply Sirona can grow revenue at or above our historical long-term targets, while also increasing profitability.The combination of these positive factors in conjunction with the significant structure of our process changes within our organization can enable Dentsply Sirona to deliver the meaningful earnings improvement expected by the end of 2025, with adjusted earnings per share of $3 targeted in 2026. So let me close with a few remarks on slide 23. We ended 2022 on a positive note by exceeding our prior outlook commitments in the fourth quarter. Importantly, there is a sense of positivity within the commercial teams about the future, driven by the structural changes, our transparency and the commission plan changes. 2023 undoubtedly, will be a transition year as the restructuring plan is put into action against a challenging external environment. However, we are confident in our capability to execute it and establish a clear path forward for the organization, its employees and its investors.We're committed to taking decisive action at Dentsply Sirona, and I believe we are not only taking decisive action, but taking the right action to improve the company, to improve its performance. We want to capitalize on the opportunity that the dental industry affords an organization like ours and believe that this restructuring enables us to drive internal alignment and accountability, simplified and fund critical growth investments. It is essential to achieving our five key objectives and delivering the meaningful earnings improvement that you expect that we expect. We are embarking on this road confidence in our collective experience, with the support of the Board and with belief that we can transform this organization. And with that, I will open it up for questions.See also 25 Largest Pizza Chains in the World and 10 Least Innovative Companies that are still in Business .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

After the stock price dropped 4.7% last week, the company's market value declined by US$7.4b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, for US$397k worth of shares, at about US$44.50 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$35.47). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Comcast insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Comcast Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Comcast. In total, Independent Director Kenneth Bacon dumped US$72k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Comcast Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Comcast insiders own about US$1.4b worth of shares (which is 0.9% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Comcast Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Comcast stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Comcast you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Iger said the streaming industry is “very, very tricky” at the moment. In recent months, shareholders have focused more on the profitability of online platforms after years of favoring subscriber growth.Earlier this week, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said at the same conference that his company would consider alternative proposals for its Hulu stake, but the terms have to be better than its agreement with Disney.On Thursday, Iger said the company hasn’t priced subscriptions to its flagship Disney+ streaming service as well as it might have, citing promotions designed to attract new customers.“Other than Netflix, which is relatively mature, it’s a nascent business for most of us,” Iger said.Last month, Iger, who returned to lead Disney in November, announced plans to overhaul the world’s largest entertainment company, including 7,000 job cuts and $5.5 billion in cost savings.The reductions included plans to trim $3 billion from its budget for movies and TV shows, with the rest coming from areas other than content.Story continuesAs part of the restructuring, Disney will be reorganized into three divisions: an entertainment unit that includes its main TV, film and streaming businesses; the ESPN sports networks; and the theme-park unit, which also includes cruise ships and consumer products.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEven Wealthy Landlords Are Skipping Payments on Office BuildingsAmerica’s $52 Billion Plan to Make Chips at Home Faces a Labor ShortageThe Biggest Winner of the Gas Stove Fight Is Induction RangesHealth-Care Oversight Rule Changes Create Legal Risk for US EmployersInstagram Founder Says the Time Has Come for a New Social Network©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(NYSE:PRU) share price down 13% in the last month. But over three years, the returns would have left most investors smiling After all, the share price is up a market-beating 71% in that time.In light of the stock dropping 8.5% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, Prudential Financial failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 0.7% (annualized).Given the share price resilience, we don't think the (declining) EPS numbers are a good measure of how the business is moving forward, right now. So other metrics may hold the key to understanding what is influencing investors.Interestingly, the dividend has increased over time; so that may have given the share price a boost. Sometimes yield-chasing investors will flock to a company if they think the dividend can grow over time.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthPrudential Financial is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Prudential Financial will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Prudential Financial's TSR for the last 3 years was 100%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Prudential Financial shareholders are down 10% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.6%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.2%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Prudential Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Prudential Financial  you should be aware of.We will like Prudential Financial better if we see some big insider buys.

Shares have lost about 9.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Prudential due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Prudential Financial Q4 Earnings Miss, Decrease Y/YPrudential Financial, Inc. reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted operating income of $2.42 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. The bottom line declined 23.9% year over year. Prudential Financial's results reflect poor performance across most of the segments, lower premiums and net investment income, offset by lower expenses.Operational UpdateTotal revenues of $12.6 billion declined 7.9% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. The fall in revenues was due to lower premiums and reduced asset management fees, commissions and other income, decreased policy charges and fee income and net investment income. The figure was higher than our estimate of $12.3 billion.Total benefits and expenses amounted to $11.5 billion, which fell 5.7% year over year in the fourth quarter. This decrease was on account of lower insurance and annuity benefits and general and administrative expenses. The figure was higher than our estimate of $11.2 billion.Quarterly Segment UpdatePrudential Global Investment Management’s (PGIM) adjusted operating income of $230 million declined 34.3% year over year. The decrease primarily reflects lower asset management fees, due to a reduction in assets under management and lower Other Related Revenues, owing to lower incentive fees, agency income and transaction fees. It was partially offset by lower expenses.PGIM assets under management of $1.2 trillion in the reported quarter, which fell 19% year over year due to higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as declines in equity markets.The U.S. Businesses delivered adjusted operating income of $864 million, which decreased 3.5% year over year. The downside was due to lower net investment spread results because of lower variable investment income and lower net fee income. It was partially offset by more favorable underwriting results.Assurance IQ incurred an adjusted operating income of $29 million against the prior-year quarter’s net operating loss of $10 million. The improvement was driven by higher Medicare commission revenues and lower expenses.International Businesses’ adjusted operating income decreased 25.4% year over year to $618 million in the fourth quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower net investment spread results due to lower variable investment income, less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior and higher expenses.Corporate and Other incurred an adjusted operating loss of $526 million, wider than the loss of $489 million reported a year ago. This higher loss reflects higher expenses, partially offset by higher income from pension and other employee benefit plans.Story continuesCapital DeploymentPrudential Financial managed to return capital to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases worth $375 million and dividends worth $449 million in the fourth quarter.Dividend Hike AnnouncedConcurrent with fourth-quarter results, Prudential Financial’s board of directors approved a 4% hike in the quarterly dividend. With this, the dividend payout now stands at $1.25 per share compared with the prior payout of $1.20. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 16, 2023 to shareholders of record as on Feb 21.Financial UpdatePRU exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $17.2 billion, which increased 33.8% from the 2021-end level. Total debt balance of $20.6 billion increased 6.9% from the figure at 2021-end. As of Dec 31, 2022, Prudential Financial’s assets under management decreased 20.9% year over year to $1.37 trillion. Adjusted book value per common share, a measure of the company’s net worth, came in at $99.22, which decreased 8.7% year over year. Operating return on average equity was 9.7% in the fourth quarter, which contracted 210 basis points (bps) year over year.Full-Year UpdateFor 2022, the adjusted operating income of Prudential Financial was $9.46 per share. The bottom line declined 35.1% from the 2021 figure. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%.  Revenues for the year totaled $61.6 billion, which climbed 3% from the 2021 level. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.3%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 5.21% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Prudential has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Prudential has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:PX) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase P10's shares before the 15th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.03 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.12 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, P10 has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current stock price of $9.93. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether P10's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for P10 If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately P10's payout ratio is modest, at just 36% of profit.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see P10's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 78% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesUnfortunately P10 has only been paying a dividend for a year or so, so there's not much of a history to draw insight from.Final TakeawayHas P10 got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. Overall, P10 looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - P10 has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

ROCK stock fell 6.1% in the past month compared with the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry’s 3.1% growth. Although adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% and increased 28.6% year over year, material, labor and supply-related challenges, project delays and disrupted solar project schedules ailed.Also, net sales lagged the consensus mark by 3.2% and fell 6.1% from the prior year’s levels. On an adjusted basis, the top line declined 5.2% year over year and organically by 9.8%. The decline was caused by lower revenues from Residential, Renewables and Agtech businesses. Order backlog at 2022-end declined 12% from 2021.On the contrary, the company is well poised to benefit from its solid Three-Pillar growth strategy and robust Infrastructure segment’s performance. Fourth quarter’s bottom line performance was driven by strong contributions from the Renewables and Infrastructure segments. The upside was backed by material cost alignment, field operations efficiency, price management, business mix, 80/20 initiatives and the share repurchase program.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see what are the factors that are offsetting these positives.Inflation Woes: Since 2020, inflation in material costs impacted ROCK’s business. During 2022, the company continued to witness higher costs related to labor and material. Also, the company had to face challenges regarding the supply of raw materials as well as logistics management. In Residential business, adjusted operating and adjusted EBITDA margins contracted 320 and 300 bps, respectively, in fourth-quarter 2022. The alignment of price and material costs and the timing of changes in commodity indexes as well as the QAP buyout impacted margins. Agtech’s adjusted operating margins declined 420 bps and adjusted EBITDA margin was down 350 bps year over year. Notably, the company expects these issues to continue for most of 2023.Low Backlog: At 2022 end, the company had approximately $300 million of backlog from continuing operations, down 12% from $344 million at 2021-end. The backlog primarily relates to certain business units in the Company's Renewables, Agtech and Infrastructure segments.The Renewables segment’s backlog decreased 17%, as the market demand for solar panel installation continues to be impacted by the UFLPA, which was implemented in June 2022, along with the impact of the Department of Commerce's preliminary ruling on its solar panel AD/CVD anti-circumvention investigation, which has impacted the scheduling of projects.Order backlog at Agtech was also impacted by continued rescheduling and rescoping of projects and decreased 13% year over year.Supply-Related Woes: Over the last few quarters, the company has been witnessing supply chain issues. The company continues to witness material and labor supply-related challenges as well as other COVID-associated crises. In the fourth quarter, the company continued to witness project delays and disrupted solar project schedules. Its Renewables and Agtech’s revenue decreased 20.8% and 17.4% year over year, respectively. The company is still dealing with panel supply issues for the U.S. solar industry, as 80% of the key materials and components for panels are produced in China.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderROCK currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Investors big and small love to chase hot new technologies or trends that promise to upend our lives and change society. While investing in cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence can be exciting, it carries a lot of risk. As many crypto investors found out the hard way, what goes up quickly can come down just as fast. So, today, we’re going to focus on “boring” industrial stocks to buy.While it may not be the most exciting, investing in industrial companies that have been around for decades and make boring but essential products needed to keep society operating efficiently can be extremely profitable. You might be surprised to learn that industrial stocks often outperform the market over the long run with less volatility.While not flashy, the industrial stocks to buy below could give a real boost to your long-term portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsITWIllinois Tool Works$236.46URIUnited Rentals$475.61APHAmphenol$78.15Illinois Tool Works (ITW)Illinois Tool Works (ITW) logo magnified while being displayed on a web browserSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIllinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) has essentially been doing the same thing for more than 100 years. Since its founding in 1912, the company has been making products that help with construction and industrial output. This includes manufacturing everything from nail guns and welding torches to fasteners such as screws, bolts and nuts, as well as powertrain components for motor vehicles. Illinois Tool Works has around 45,000 employees and generates annual revenue of nearly $16 billion.Given its focus on the construction and industrial sectors, Illinois Tool Works is a cyclical stock that tends to perform best when the economy is doing well. However, despite mounting concerns of a potential recession, shares have outperformed over the past year, gaining 11.6% compared with a 6.5% loss for the S&amp;P 500. Over the past 10 years, ITW is up 288% versus 160% for the broader market.Story continuesAnother reason for investors to put ITW on their list of industrial stocks to buy is its dividend. The company is a dividend king, having raised its dividend for 59 consecutive years. With a quarterly payout of $1.31 per share, the stock yields 2.3%.United Rentals (URI)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for United Rentals (URI).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of industrial stocks to buy that have outperformed, how about United Rentals (NYSE:URI)?

It rents construction equipment such as forklifts, backhoes, bulldozers and excavators. United Rentals also rents out plumbing and HVAC equipment, as well as portable toilets that are used on job sites.United Rentals has nearly 25,000 employees and generated $11.6 billion in revenue for 2022. In addition to operating in every region of the U.S. and Canada, United Rentals is expanding across Europe, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. The $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law in the U.S. last year is expected to be a boon for the company.Amphenol (APH)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockMost investors haven’t heard of Amphenol (NYSE:APH). And that’s understandable since the company has scant analyst coverage and gets almost no media coverage. Yet, the Connecticut-based company has been a very good investment for a very long time.The company got its start in 1932 as the American Phenolic Corporation making tube sockets for radio tubes, which, at the time, were considered to be cutting edge. During World War II, the company became the primary manufacturer of connectors used in the Allied forces’ airplanes and radios. Today, the company produces coaxial cables and fiber optic connectors. Basically, Amphenol makes the nuts and bolts that keep our tech devices running smoothly.While the company flies under the radar, it is a major corporation with more than 90,000 employees and 2022 sales of $12.6 billion.

Profit, excluding some items, was $1.22 a share. Analysts, on average, projected $1.20 a share.Cloud revenue — the highly watched segment that Oracle has been trying to expand — rose 45% to $4.1 billion in the period ended Feb. 28, the Austin, Texas-based company said Thursday in a statement.While Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business — renting computing power and storage — has been a relative laggard in the market, analysts have been optimistic the services are gaining customers and helping accelerate growth. The software giant has employed aggressive marketing and favorable pricing in an attempt to win clients from larger competitors Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., which have seen cloud division growth slowdowns in recent quarters.Large cloud deals, including one announced with Uber Technologies Inc., increased investor excitement ahead of earnings, wrote JP Morgan’s Mark Murphy. Analysts at Mizuho Securities said in advance of the results that Wall Street’s estimates for Oracle’s cloud business “appear conservative.”But the results looked like “a little bit of a disappointment,” Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said the numbers also may indicate weaker demand for information technology amid continuing economic uncertainty.Story continuesShares fell about 4.6% in premarket trading before New York exchanges opened on Friday after closing at $86.87. Oracle has been one of the steadiest tech stocks over the last year, rising 14% during the 12 months through Thursday.Sales will increase about 16% in the current period ending in May, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said on a conference call after the results. The outlook is in line with estimates. Profit, excluding some items, will be $1.56 a share to $1.60 a share, she added. Analysts, on average, projected $1.45 a share.“We continue to believe the company is navigating the slowdown better than most large rivals,” wrote Bloomberg Intelligence’s Anurag Rana.Oracle’s digital health records provider Cerner generated sales of $1.5 billion in the period, and Chairman Larry Ellison said the company anticipates even stronger growth for the unit.“While we are pleased with this early success of the Cerner business, we expect the signing of new health care contracts to accelerate over the next few quarters,” Ellison said in the statement. Catz said the division’s operating margin has increased over 5 percentage points since the acquisition.More than two-thirds of Oracle’s cloud revenue is generated by business applications such as Fusion software for managing corporate finances and NetSuite’s enterprise planning tools, which are targeted at small- and mid-size companies. Fusion sales increased 25% in the quarter, compared with 23% growth in the previous period. NetSuite revenue jumped 23%, compared with 25% in the fiscal second quarter.Oracle increased its dividend 25% to 40 cents a share. Ellison, the company’s largest shareholder, “did not participate in the deliberation or the vote on this matter,” the company said. The additional 8 cents a share in quarterly dividends is set to make Ellison about $91.6 million, based on his ownership of more than 1.14 billion shares disclosed at the end of December.(Updates with premarket trading in seventh paragraph.

(NYSE:YUM) insider lowered their holding by 14% earlier this year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-inc-nyse-yum-120016652.html,1678449616,STORY,['YUM'],"[From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Yum! Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Yum! Brands Yum! Brands Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent sale by Tracy Skeans was the biggest sale of Yum! Brands shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$126. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Yum! Brands better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Yum! Brands Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Yum! Brands shares. In total, COO &amp; Chief People Officer Tracy Skeans dumped US$510k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of Yum! BrandsFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Yum! Brands insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$41m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Yum! Brands Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Yum! Brands (including 2 which are significant).Of course Yum! Brands may not be the best stock to buy.

Shares have lost about 6.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Chipotle due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Chipotle's Q4 Earnings and Revenues Miss EstimatesChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. reported fourth-quarter 2022 results, with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionIn the quarter under review, Chipotle reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $8.29, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.88. The bottom line improved 48.6% from the $5.58 reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly revenues of $2,180.6 million missed the consensus mark of $2,229 million. The top line increased 11.2% on a year-over-year basis. The upside can primarily be attributed to robust comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. In the quarter under review, Chipotle opened 100 new restaurants.Digital sales contributed 37.4% of total food and beverage revenues. During the third quarter, comparable restaurant sales increased 5.6% year over year, following growth of 7.6% (in third-quarter 2022), 10.1% (in second-quarter 2022), 9% (in first-quarter 2022) and 15.2% (in fourth-quarter 2021).Costs, Operating Highlights &amp; Net IncomeDuring fourth-quarter 2022, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, came in at 29.3%, down 230 basis points (bps) year over year. In the fourth quarter, the benefit of menu price increases was overshadowed by inflation across the menu, mainly due to higher costs for dairy and tortillas.During the reported quarter, the restaurant-level operating margin came in at 24%, up from 20.2% reported in the year-ago quarter. The uptick was primarily backed by sales leverage benefits and lower delivery fees. However, this was partially offset by wage inflation and higher food costs.Adjusted net income in the reported quarter amounted to $231.4 million compared with $159.1 reported million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2022, the company reported cash and cash equivalent of $384 million compared with $815.4 million as of Dec 31, 2021.Inventory totaled $35.7 million as of Dec 31, 2022, compared with $32.8 million as of Dec 31, 2021. Goodwill (as a percentage of total assets) came in at 0.3% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased $198.9 million worth of stock at an average price of $1,486.7. Management approved an additional $200 million (exclusive of commissions) to repurchase shares. As of Dec 31, the company had approximately $413.9 million available for the buyback program.2022 HighlightsTotal revenues in 2022 amounted to $8,634.7 million compared with $7,547.1 million in 2021.Adjusted Net Income in 2022 totaled $919.8 million compared with $724.8 million in 2021.In 2022, diluted EPS came in at $32.78 per share compared with $25.42 reported in the previous year.2023 OutlookFor first-quarter 2023, the company expects comps growth in the high single digits.The company expects to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023. It expects a 2023 tax rate in the range of 25-27%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Chipotle has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Chipotle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerChipotle is part of the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry. Over the past month, McDonald's (MCD), a stock from the same industry, has gained 1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.McDonald's reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.4%.

303,4471c220-c9c2-36d9-9775-6d98fbc08799,PLD,2023-03-10,Key Reasons Why Prologis' (PLD) Shares Jumped 10.9% QTD,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-reasons-why-prologis-pld-133001551.html,1678368601,STORY,['PLD'],"[Shares of Prologis (PLD), carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have gained 10.9% in the quarter-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s growth of 3.3%.In January, this behemoth of the industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) category reported fourth-quarter 2022 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. The figure climbed 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.The quarterly results reflect better-than-anticipated revenues, driven by healthy leasing activity and solid rent growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price.The demand for industrial real estate space is escalating, given the growth in industries, an e-commerce boom and companies’ endeavors to improve their supply-chain efficiencies. Prologis’ portfolio of modern and high-quality logistics facilities has benefited from these favorable industrial real estate market fundamentals.The company has been witnessing a healthy operating performance, as evident from its solid leasing activities. In the fourth quarter of 2022, 42.5 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 36.9 msf in the operating portfolio and 5.6 msf in the development portfolio. Moreover, the retention level was 82.4% in the quarter, up from 76.4% reported at the end of the prior quarter.Prologis’ average occupancy level in its owned and managed portfolio was 98% in the fourth quarter. Its share of net effective rent change came in at 50.6% in the fourth quarter, which was led by the United States at 55%. The cash rent change was 32.4%. The cash same-store net operating income (NOI) was 9.1%. The growth was led by the United States at 9.6%.To enhance its portfolio, PLD is focusing on acquisitions and developments in strategic markets. In 2022, the company’s share of building acquisitions amounted to $2.07 billion, with a weighted average stabilized cap rate (excluding other real estate) of 4.3%. Development stabilization aggregated $2.88 billion, while development starts totaled $4.67 billion, with 39.2% being build-to-suit.Notably, in October 2022, the company closed on the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, including the assumption of debt, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets of the United States.The company’s robust balance-sheet position enabled it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $4.1 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities as of Dec 31, 2022. Also, credit ratings of A3 (Outlook Stable) from Moody’s and A (Outlook Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s as of Dec 31, 2022, render the company easy access to the debt market at favorable costs.The company’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 7.71% compared with the industry’s average of 3.77%, indicating that it is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Solid dividends are a huge attraction for REIT investors, and PLD has remained committed to that. It has increased its dividend six times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 11.91%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, the rising supply in several markets is likely to intensify competition and curb pricing power. The stabilization of e-commerce sales growth and more modest demand remain concerns for rent increases.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Alexandria Real Estate Equities ARE and Terreno Realty TRNO, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VICI Properties’ current-year FFO per share is pegged at $2.10.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alexandria’s 2023 FFO per share is pegged at $8.94.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Terreno Realty’s ongoing year’s FFO per share is pegged at $2.17.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The advancement in technologies, stricter emissions and fuel-economy targets and increasing commercial viability of green vehicles — both in terms of affordability and charging infrastructure — are boosting the environment-friendly EV market.One of the leading truck manufacturers in the world, PACCAR PCAR, is betting big on innovative technologies and electric and hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles to keep up with the changing dynamics of the auto industry. PACCAR’s CEO Preston Feight believes that EV offerings will play a big role in the company’s medium-long-term prospects. He said during the last earnings call, “We think that the EV market, the zero-emissions vehicle market will just gradually grow. We're well positioned for that growth. And we have some fantastic vehicles out there that are providing great experiences.”PCAR’s Strides in Trucking RevolutionPACCAR's leading brands include Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF, and the company has already rolled out electric versions of some of its most popular models. Currently, it has nine EV models in production. This trucking titan is leading the industry in electric, connected and autonomous commercial vehicles. In fact, at the CES 2023 Transportation Hall, PCAR was the only trucking OEM with a booth for exhibiting its vehicles with advanced technologies. The displayed vehicles included a battery-powered Peterbilt 579EV, a hydrogen fuel-cell Kenworth T680E and a Peterbilt autonomous Model 579.The Peterbilt 579EV model is currently under production and is suitable for regional distribution and port drayage applications. The Peterbilt 579 model is equipped with PACCAR’s autonomous vehicle platform and configured with Aurora’s self-driving system. The second-gen hydrogen fuel cell Kenworth T680E is developed jointly with the Japan-based auto giant Toyota. At the CES 2022, PACCAR showcased Kenworth T680E battery-electric truck, having a range of 150 miles and fast charge time utilizing PACCAR’s battery charging solution, making it an ideal choice for regional haul and urban distribution applications.Story continuesLast year, PACCAR’s capex and R&amp;D costs totaled $505 million and $341.2 million, respectively. For 2023, PACCAR targets to invest $525-$575 million in capital projects. It plans to spend $360-$410 million in R&amp;D. The company is ramping up investments in next-gen clean diesel and electric powertrain technologies, connected vehicle services, self-driving systems and advanced manufacturing and distribution capabilities.PACCAR’s next-gen vehicle offerings and increasing investments to build the same demonstrate its commitment to reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR’s prospects.We Are Optimistic on PCARLast year, PACCAR achieved record annual revenues and net income of $28.8 billion and $3.01 billion, respectively, led by robust growth across major truck markets and impressive results in its Parts and Financial Services units.In the U.S. and Canadian markets, Class 8 truck retail sales hit 283,500 units in 2022. The 2023 U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market deliveries are forecast in the range of 270,000-310,000 vehicles. In 2022, the European above 16-ton truck registrations reached 298,000 units and is forecast in the band of 270,000-310,000 units for this year.Pent-up demand and customers’ need to replace aging fleets with newer and superior models bode well for PACCAR’s demand for Kenworth, DAF and Peterbilt models. The DAF lineup comprising XF and XG models (launched in 2021) and the XD model (launched in 2022) is improving the company’s product mix. The DAF XG distribution and vocational truck was named the 2023 International Truck of the Year. PACCAR’s newer trucks are achieving popularity thanks to their premium quality, better fuel efficiency and lower operating costs.While PACCAR derives the bulk of its revenues from truck sales, it also produces and sells a wide range of parts, including its own brand of engines. Continued growth in the aftermarket parts—which is a high margin and a less cyclic business— thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine bodes well. In 2022, PACCAR Parts new records for annual revenues and profits. as high truck utilization contributed to strong global demand for parts. Customers’ high truck utilization and increased average fleet age are positively impacting PACCAR Parts results and the trend will continue this year as well. An expanding network of parts distribution centers, dealer locations and independent TRP stores and managed dealer inventory and innovative e-commerce systems are aiding the unit’s prospects.Strong financials and investor-friendly moves also boost confidence. PACCAR’s robust balance sheet is complemented by A+/A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively. The company's long-term debt-to-capital ratio stands at 0.37, lower than its industry's 0.41. The low leverage increases its financial flexibility to tap into growth opportunities. The firm's times interest earned ratio of 17 is higher than the industry’s 10.46, signifying low default risk. It should be noted that PACCAR has paid a dividend every year since 1941. It increased its dividend eight times in the last five years, with an average annualized growth of 5.51%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR’s 2023 sales and revenues indicates a year-over-year growth of 6.3% and 12.6%, respectively. PCAR has established a healthy track record of earnings surprises as the firm has surpassed estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 14.15% over that timeframe. The stock has performed admirably over the past year and is up nearly 32.3%—handily outperforming the industry’s decline of 37.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHit the Buy Button Now?While PCAR remains an appealing investment option for the long haul, thanks to its innovative offerings and expanding production capacities, short-term uncertainties persist. The recessionary fears might reduce the demand for Class 8 trucks. Supply chain chaos, albeit gradually easing, is far from over. Manufacturing inefficiencies associated with supply-chain disruptions, high commodity costs, tough labor market and logistical challenges will play spoilsport. Despite these near-term hiccups, PACCAR is worth holding onto. Those who haven’t invested in the stock yet, could wait for a pullback and grab the stock at a better entry point.PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

H. Robinson Worldwide, the largest U.S. freight broker, is in advanced talks to name former United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) chief operating officer Jim Barber as chief executive officer after the departure of Bob Biesterfeld, two sources familiar with the discussions said.Barber, who spent nearly 35 years working at package delivery company UPS before retiring in early 2020, joined the C.H. Robinson board as a director late last year.He would take the top job after Biesterfeld, who had been with the company for two dozen years and served as CEO for 3-1/2 years, was fired. A regulatory filing in early January described Biesterfeld's departure as an ""involuntary termination by the company.""A spokesperson for the company said there is ""no update"" on the search, noting ""the CEO role at C.H. Robinson is a great job with enormous potential. The Board is committed to conducting, and is underway on, an open and inclusive search to find our next CEO.""Barber could not be reached for comment. The sources spoke about the CEO selection process on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.The company's stock price moved higher, rising more than 3.5% at one point, and exchanged hands at $105.03, up 2.31% in late morning trading.The company tapped Scott Anderson, who had been the company's board chair, as its interim CEO. Search firm Russell Reynolds was hired to find a permanent replacement and Anderson signaled he was not interested in the position, the filing said.Roughly a year ago Ancora Advisors reached an agreement with the company, which is valued at $12 billion, for two board seats in return for not launching a board challenge. As part of the settlement the company agreed to form a strategic planning committee.Last year Reuters reported that Danish transport and logistics company DSV A/S was interested in buying C.H. Robinson's business unit that specializes in arranging international cargo transport on behalf of shippers.From the beginning, Barber has been seen as a strong CEO candidate, investors said and industry analysts wrote in notes after he was appointed to the board. He spent several years as President of UPS' international operations.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Mark Potter and Josie Kao)]"

The new repurchase authorization substitutes the leftover shares of roughly 36 million, which formed a part of the repurchase authorization sanctioned by the Board in 2019.Concurrent with the new buyback program, management approved a 15% hike in the quarterly dividend. Therefore, the latest payout stands at 60 cents per share compared with the prior payout of 52 cents.The increased dividend will be paid out on May 10, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Apr 7, 2023. American Express has been a regular dividend-paying company for more than three decades, which is commendable. Based on the stock’s Mar 8 closing price of $174.83, the new dividend will yield 1.2% to the company.Prior to the recent dividend hike, American Express had sanctioned an increase of roughly 20% in its quarterly dividend in 2022.  This significant dividend hike followed two consecutive years of no dividend hikes, probably due to COVID-induced volatilities.Even though American Express did not resort to dividend hikes amid the pandemic, it still sustained its age-old record of rewarding shareholders even in the dismal period wherein many companies were compelled to cut down their capital deployment activities. AXP returned $9 billion and $2.3 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments.2022 seemed to be another promising year for American Express as well on the capital deployment front. The company bought back 20 million common shares worth $3.3 billion last year. It also paid dividends worth $1.6 billion to shareholders in the same time frame. Together, share repurchases and dividends denoted around 64% of total capital generated in 2022, thereby highlighting AXP’s intensified focus on capital deployment.A strong financial position equips a company to pursue uninterrupted share buybacks and dividend payments. The same has been the case with American Express, which is backed by a solid cash balance and robust cash generation abilities. As of Dec 31, 2022, AXP’s cash and cash equivalents increased more than four-fold from the 2021-end level. Net cash provided by operating activities surged 43.9% year over year in 2022.Story continuesShares of American Express have gained 18.3% year to date compared with the industry’s 9.2% growth.

I joined during Covid, while everyone was still working from home - it was quite strange to get to get to know our colleagues virtually, and I was longing to meet everybody in person!Finally, after more than a year, we reopened the office. At this time I was probably spending too much time by the coffee machine trying to catch everyone for a chat!Since then, MDLZ in Sweden has been on a growth journey; our brands are growing nicely; we have initiated a program together with the Swedish football association to educate 96 female coaches on UEFA B level to encourage more female role models; we are stepping up the sustainability agenda by e.g. reducing the CO2 emissions in transportation with 88% due to having HVO diesel, and much more, while tackling unprecedented challenges in unprecedented times.What do you like about working at MDLZ, and what do you think is special about us?At MDLZ, we have so many passionate and proud colleagues! They focus every day on fulfilling the needs of our consumers and customers. It is amazing to be surrounded by people who truly love our products and brands.The FMCG industry is a fast-paced industry that is easy to love. For example, you get rapid feedback from consumers on which products they love and which products they're not satisfied with, that's why we feel such a close connection to our consumers. Also, people can relate to your job since they know very well the products we and our peers sellWhat motivated you to become a leader?I love winning as a team! It is so rewarding to see colleagues grow and accomplish things they thought were impossible. I see myself as a change catalyst, helping people to dare.Story continuesThis International Women's Day, is there a piece of advice you would share with the next generation of aspiring women leaders within FMCG? Start with yourself. I make sure I am equally supportive to all colleagues and stakeholders, and most people can go further than they think is possible. It's so important to surround yourself with allies, at home and at work, not the least in your leadership team to ensure diversity and equality is cascaded throughout the company. My leadership team is equal from a gender perspective, and a mix of Swedish and non-Swedish citizens.What's the best career advice you've ever received?Be open to take sideways moves, even though it may add a couple of years to you reaching your goals. In the end you will be more likely to reach higher with cross functional experience.What career advice would you give?Be curious and focus on your own learning experience.

Shares have lost about 10.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Hain Celestial due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Hain Celestial Q2 Earnings Beat Mark, Sales Dip Y/YHain Celestial posted second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate while earnings beat the same. Both the top and the bottom line fell from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. However, management reaffirmed its view for fiscal 2023.Quarter in DetailHain Celestial posted adjusted earnings of 20 cents a share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our consensus estimate of 14 cents each. However, the bottom line significantly plunged from 36 cents reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter.Net sales of $454.2 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $456 million but came ahead of our consensus mark of $453.6 million. The top line dipped 5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. After foreign exchange adjustment, acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales slipped 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Adjusted gross profit of $103.9 million fell 11.5% from the prior-year quarter’s tally, while adjusted gross margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) 22.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Adjusted operating income was $35.4 million in the reported quarter, down 22.7% from the year-ago fiscal quarter. Also, the adjusted operating margin contracted 180 bps from the year-earlier fiscal quarter to 7.8%.Adjusted EBITDA on a constant-currency basis dropped 11.1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure to $52.7 million, while adjusted EBITDA margin fell 144 bps to 11%.Story continuesSegmental ResultsNet sales in the North America segment rose 2.7% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure to $282.4 million. After currency movements adjustment, acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales fell 2% owing to the retailer inventory adjustments, particularly in tea and soft sales in personal care. This was somewhat offset by increased sales of snacks.Segment-adjusted operating income jumped 12% to $32.3 million, mainly aided by pricing increases, reduced marketing spending and productivity. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis amounted to $38.8 million, up nearly 16%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 150 bps to 13.6%.International net sales declined 14.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure to $171.8 million. Upon adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations, net sales dropped 3% due to softness in plant-based categories in Europe.Segment-adjusted operating income tumbled 55% to $12.5 million due to lower gross profit and sales coupled with elevated energy and supply-chain costs as well as under-absorption of overhead expenses at the company’s manufacturing facilities. Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was $21.9 million, down 36% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 580 bps to 11.2%.Other FinancialsHain Celestial ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $43.4 million, long-term debt (excluding the current portion) of $870.8 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,108.6 million.The company reported cash used in operating activities of $2.7 million and a negative operating free cash flow of $16.7 million during the second quarter year-to-date period of fiscal 2023.OutlookHain Celestial reiterated guidance for adjusted net sales and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis in the range of a decline of 1% to a rise of 4% from the year-ago fiscal period’s reading. Management anticipates currency exchange headwind to be roughly $85 million and $10 million for adjusted sales and adjusted EBITDA, respectively.This is likely to be backed by stable North America top-line results with moderate price elasticities, International performance reverting to growth in the second half along with greater pricing efforts, gains from private label offerings and the lapping of the starting of the Russia-Ukraine war along with the loss of the co-manufacturing contract. Moreover, the overall gross margin progressed from the prior year on continued improvement in supply-chain results with greater service levels, productivity and cost management.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -37.26% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Hain Celestial has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Hain Celestial has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerHain Celestial belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry.

321,16de74ae-accc-37e0-aa63-a803f9e33ef3,OXY,2023-03-10,12 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-small-cap-stocks-insider-200008015.html,1678392008,STORY,"['DSEY', 'KYMR', 'MTX', 'JBGS', 'CRTO', 'TBBK', 'ESTE', 'OXY', 'ADI', 'SYY']","[In this article, we discuss 12 small-cap stocks with insider buying. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying. Insider buying refers to a company's officers, directors, or major shareholders purchasing shares of their own company's stock. Insider purchases can send a positive signal to the market that insiders believe the company's stock is undervalued and has potential for future growth. They also align the interests of the company's management and shareholders. Insider buying can increase transparency and accountability by providing information about the company's financial health and growth potential. This information can help investors make more informed decisions about whether to invest in the company's stock.According to a report from Argus Research in June 2022, corporate insiders seemed to recognize the value of their stocks, as per high trading activity at the time. Vickers Stock Research data was cited by Argus, which noted that insiders purchased shares of their respective companies in large numbers during June’s significant stock market decline. The report stated that the data indicates that corporate insiders were either buying their own company's stock at the same frequency as they were selling it, or they were buying more than they were selling. This surge in insider buying resulted in a sell-to-buy ratio of almost 1.0 in the eight-week period, which the report described as a ""very healthy"" level. Typically, insiders tend to sell their shares 2-2.5 times more frequently than they purchase them. Argus further explained:""While there are many reasons to think stocks could fall further, current insider sentiment is not one of them. Insiders apparently see across-the-board value in stocks as they are ‘keeping the faith.’”Investors should pay attention to the positive signal sent by corporate insiders, especially in light of the current economic climate. With inflation at a 40-year high, interest rates increasing rapidly, and the possibility of a recession looming, insider buying can provide reassurance to investors about the potential health and stability of their investments. Some of the companies which experienced significant insider buying in 2022 include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), and Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). However, in this article, we discuss the top small-cap stocks with insider buying. Story continuesOur Methodology We used a stock screener to filter for small-cap stocks, which have market caps between $300 million to $2 billion. Then we filtered for companies with insider transactions of more than 20%. This metric represents six-month percentage change in total insider ownership. The resultant dataset was ranked according to market cap in the descending order, and we selected the top small-cap firms with insider purchases during 2022 onwards. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Small-Cap Stocks With Insider BuyingPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashSmall-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying12.

For the first time in our 33-year history, our annual revenue surpassed $10 billion, and our annual net income exceeded $1 billion. In addition, we expanded our loyalty program to more than 40 million members. Achieving such meaningful milestones reflects healthy consumer engagement with the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's highly differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding teams.The Ulta Beauty team continues to execute with excellence and inspire me daily with their passion and leadership. I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences and for working together as one team to move our business forward. I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who bring our mission, vision and values to life for all of our stakeholders.Now to the results. Starting with the fourth quarter, net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 13.9% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 23.5% to $6.68 per share. Sales of all major categories exceeded our expectations, and we saw solid sales momentum across both our store and digital channels.Additionally, we continued to see healthy growth in spend per member across all income demographics. This broad-based strength reflects successful execution of our key fourth quarter events, including holiday, Jumbo Love and Love Your Skin. Our holiday marketing plan, which included new television advertising, engaging storytelling and robust digital and social support, delivered strong guest engagement and drove significant increases in top-of-mind awareness. Our holiday gifting assortment, which was thoughtfully curated across every category and budget, resonated with guests, and our innovative and inclusive gift card program delivered strong double-digit growth across Ulta Beauty-owned and third-party channels.Turning to performance by category. All major categories delivered double-digit growth again this quarter, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus the fourth quarter last year based on data from the NPD Group.Skin care delivered the strongest growth this quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by serums, moisturizers, acne treatments and holiday gift sets. Guests engaged with newness from brands like Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Hero cosmetics. While dermatology-based brands like La Roche-Posay and CeraVe also resonated strongly with guests. Our successful Love Your Skin event also contributed to the category's strong growth. In addition to converting members to the skin care category with prestige skin care offers, we also introduced guests to our wellness assortment with new beauty steals from a variety of brands, including Truly, Love Wellness and Sugarbear.The fragrance and bath category delivered another quarter of double-digit growth on top of strong double-digit growth last year. Compelling newness from luxury brands like Burberry, YSL and Dior as well as exclusive newness from Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande including her latest fragrance, MOD, contributed to the positive growth. In addition, the category benefited from strong engagement with our exclusive holiday fragrance gift sets and monthly Fragrance Crush programs. Growth of the makeup category accelerated from the third quarter with double-digit growth in both prestige and mass makeup. Top subcategories were base and lip driven by newness in foundation, concealers and lip balms and glosses. New brands like Fenty Beauty, r.e.m. beauty and recently launched Dior contributed to growth during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Tarte, e.l.f., NYX and Clinique also continued to engage guests.Finally, hair care delivered double-digit growth driven by newness and innovation focused on hair health. Newer brands like OLAPLEX, MAËLYS and recently launched Donna's Recipe contributed to the quarter's growth. Our Jumbo Love event drove healthy growth for key professional brands like Pureology, Redken and Biolage as well as masstige brands, KRISTIN ESS and Batiste.Hair tools continued to experience broad softness as we lapped strong newness last year. Our services business also delivered strong double-digit growth again this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. Leveraging our CRM capabilities, we continue to welcome new members to services while increasing frequency with members who already engaged in our service offering. And the salon back bar takeovers which give our stylists a unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests, help drive growth and new member acquisition for OUAI and Bumble and bumble.Now turning to the full year. Strong consumer demand and outstanding execution by our teams fueled broad-based strength across our business. Net sales for the year increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.In 2021, we introduced a new strategic framework designed to guide our priorities and enable Ulta Beauty to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. Let me share a few highlights of the progress we made against this framework in fiscal 2022.Our first strategic pillar is to drive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. And this year, we continued to enhance our offerings to engage and excite beauty enthusiasts. All major categories delivered double-digit comp growth, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus fiscal 2021 based on data from the NPD Group.We strengthened our assortment with the addition of leading brands in every major category, including Fenty Beauty, Dior, BYOMA and MAËLYS and expanded MAC and Chanel Beauté into more doors. We also introduced guests to exciting emerging brands, including about-face, Divi, sk*p and Vacation through our Sparked platform.We enhanced conscious beauty at Ulta Beauty, ending the year with 300 brands certified in at least 1 conscious beauty pillar and made it easier for guests to identify brands and products that reflect their values in this important space. We added 12 black-owned and founded brands to our assortment and launched our Muse Accelerator program to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. And we expanded The Wellness Shop to an additional 330 stores and enhanced our online offering to include intimate wellness.Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World. We're focused on evolving guest experiences through a personalized connected omni-channel ecosystem. In fiscal 2022, we continued to enhance the guest experience across all our touch points. We expanded our physical footprint, opening 47 new stores and renovating or relocating 32 stores. We relaunched makeup services and introduced new salon services, including curl-specific treatments and extensions. These enhancements, combined with record-setting stylist productivity and increased transactions, resulted in strong double-digit growth for our services business.Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities, we expanded our same-day delivery offering to 6 new markets and delivered significant improvement in guest satisfaction with the BOPIS experience. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 28% last year.We also created new digital experiences through the phased refresh of our digital store and the expansion of virtual try-on capabilities, including GLAMlab Skin Advisor 2.0 and the hair style try-on.Finally, our successful partnership with Target continued to grow with the opening of 254 additional Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations. We also created a dedicated field team to help unlock greater opportunity with the partnership, and through engaging store visits and communications, this team had a positive impact on staffing, training and loyalty.Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening our engagement with guests by ensuring Ulta Beauty operates at the heart of the beauty community. During the year, we continued to drive guest love, loyalty and share of wallet, and our efforts created stronger, more emotional connections with our guests. Overall, unaided awareness grew significantly with meaningful gains among key audiences including Gen Z, Hispanic and Black beauty consumers.Importantly, we increased the number of active members in our loyalty program by more than 3 million members, ending fiscal 2022 with a record-breaking 40.2 million Ultamate Reward members, who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. And we launched our retail media network, UB Media, with a dedicated sales team and supported by new processes and tools.Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share on guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth. In fiscal 2022, we made progress on a number of initiatives that will enable us to scale more easily, including successfully executing Phase 1 of Project SOAR, our 3-year effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning platform on time and on budget.In addition to successfully navigating inflationary pressures in wages and fuel, we initiated a multiyear supply chain optimization effort, breaking ground on our first market fulfillment center and beginning the planned retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center. Both facilities are on track to be fully operational in fiscal 2023. Our winning culture is key to driving our success, so our fifth strategic pillar is focused on protecting and cultivating our world-class culture and talent. Our vision is to create a highly aligned, engaged workforce and an inclusive workplace that creates opportunities for our people and our business, and I am proud of the progress we made last year.With strong participation rates in our annual company-wide engagement survey, our overall engagement remains high and continued to exceed retail benchmarks. And our investments in our team and culture enabled us to promote more than 11,000 associates into new roles and improve associate retention across the enterprise.Finally, our sixth strategic pillar is to expand our environmental and social impact. As the largest U.S. beauty retailer, we can influence how the world sees beauty while driving positive impact. In fiscal 2022, we delivered on our DEI commitments by investing $50 million across our major areas of focus, including multicultural media to amplify underrepresented voices, dedicated support for BIPOC brands, and associate training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.On the environmental side, we continue to reduce our energy usage through the expansion of our LED lighting retrofit program to an additional 100 stores and our Chambersburg DC as well as additional energy efficiency project in select stores. We also enhanced our ESG disclosures in our second ESG report and submitted emissions targets to The Science Based Target Initiative, a globally recognized organization that validates these targets.Fiscal 2022 was an outstanding year, and I am incredibly proud of our associates' dedication to delivering value for all stakeholders while building the foundation for the future. As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category and the opportunities for Ulta Beauty. Over the last 2 years, the U.S. beauty category experienced unprecedented growth, reflecting various factors such as product innovation, expanding regimens, new social media platforms, return to work and resumed social activities, and the elevated connection between beauty and overall self-care.In addition to these consumer drivers, an elevated level of price increases also contributed to growth for the category. While some are unique to the post-pandemic recovery, we believe other factors will continue driving growth for the category. Importantly, consumer engagement with beauty is stronger than ever and is more connected with wellness. These factors give us confidence that the growth of the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy but moderate to the higher end of the category's historical annual growth rate of between 2% and 5%, barring a major economic event.Building on the progress made in fiscal 2022, we intend to continue executing against our strategic framework to further expand our market leadership, drive profitable growth and transform our business for the future in fiscal 2023. Starting with our consumer-centric strategic pillars, we will continue to innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. Today, Ulta Beauty is the preferred destination for mass and prestige beauty. To maintain this leadership and capture additional market share, we will continue to add relevant brands to our assortment across categories and price points.Additionally, building on customer insights and strong engagement with our current portfolio of luxury brands, we see luxury beauty as an emerging opportunity. In fiscal 2023, we will expand our luxury beauty offering with an engaging experience in select stores and an elevated presence on ulta.com. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we will continue to expand, evolve and amplify our cross-category platforms, including Conscious Beauty, our BIPOC-founded brands, The Wellness Shop and Sparked, our emerging brands platform.As we meet beauty enthusiasts, wherever they are in their beauty journey, All In Your World, we will continue to invest in our omni-channel experiences. Our physical footprint is a strategic advantage, and we plan to open 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores throughout the year. As we expand our physical footprint, we will also accelerate growth across digital platforms, supported by the completed transition of our digital store to a modern technology and architecture as well as the expansion of our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities.Our partnership with Target will continue to expand as we support additional Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and leverage our dedicated field team to deliver elevated guest experiences. This newest touch point is introducing new guests to Ulta Beauty, and we intend to leverage our customer insights and CRM capabilities to continue driving additional member acquisition and bounce back to Ulta Beauty.To operate at the heart of the beauty community, we will continue to create and nurture authentic meaningful connections with our guests to drive stronger relevance and brand consideration, especially with key constituents. We plan to expand the power of our loyalty program by enhancing our media mix to acquire new members and elevate the loyalty program throughout our digital shopping experience.We plan to leverage our analytics and data insights further to reactivate lapsed guests, increased retention and shift share of wallet. And we intend to leverage our digital and physical assets to drive greater omni-channel member penetration. Finally, we plan to accelerate UB Media to capture greater demand from our brand partners. Building on the foundation established in 2022, we will offer new opportunities on Ulta-owned properties and enhanced existing products with advanced reporting and optimized audience selection.Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2023, we plan to implement the next phase of Project SOAR, transitioning key supply chain and merchandising processes to the new platform. We will continue our supply chain optimization efforts as we complete the retrofit of our Greenwood DC and the opening of our first market fulfillment center. In addition, we will begin the retrofit of our Dallas DC and construction of our second market fulfillment center here in Bolingbrook, Illinois. This new facility will replace our existing Romeoville facility and transition our experienced team to a new state-of-the-art facility. In addition to these transformation initiatives, we will leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies.Our success is enabled by our world-class culture. Values-based and anchored in caring for each other, the Ulta Beauty culture attracts and retains top talent who deliver great guest experiences across multiple channels every day. To protect and cultivate our culture and enable future business performance, we will invest purposefully in our associates and teams. This year, we plan to modernize our talent strategy and planning practices, enrich our learning and development offerings, and enable a leading DEI ecosystem.Finally, in 2023, we will stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Being good stewards of resources, taking care of each other and creating a positive impact on the world is part of our DNA, and our ESG priorities are integrated into our guest-facing, operational excellence and culture strategies.Building on progress made to date, we expect The Science Based Targets Initiative to take action on our submission in the first quarter, and based on their feedback, we plan to develop a road map to achieve our emission reduction targets. We also plan to launch packaging, recycling and reusable bag pilots as we explore ways to support a more sustainable beauty industry. We will continue working to expand our DEI efforts to amplify underrepresented voices, support Black entrepreneurs in the business industry, ensure inclusivity remains a top priority in every guest engagement, and foster an inclusive bias-free and equitable workplace for all associates.And we will continue to strengthen our corporate governance practices. Over the last several years, our Board has updated our governance guidelines to better express our commitment to diversity, implemented an age limit for directors to encourage Board refreshment and updated committee charters to address oversight of ESG risks. This year, our Board will propose, for stockholder approval, changes to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which, among other things, will declassify the Board and provide for the annual election of each director for 1-year terms.If approved, the Board will be fully declassified by our 2025 annual stockholder meeting. These proactive measures reflect our commitment to operating with best-in-class governance practices. More detail about these proposed changes will be provided in our 2023 proxy statements.In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered an outstanding performance in fiscal 2022, on top of a very strong performance in fiscal '21. As we look to 2023, I am optimistic about our opportunities to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We are leaders in a culturally relevant growing category with a strong proven business model and a winning culture with outstanding associates who are passionate about caring for our guests and each other.I remain confident we will continue to lead the category and move beauty forward in ways that have a positive impact on our guests, our associates and the communities we serve.And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?Scott M. SetterstenThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these exceptional results for our shareholders. We have long known our associates are our competitive advantage, and this year's results are an ongoing reflection of their relentless commitment to our guests and to executing with excellence.Now to our fourth quarter results beginning with the income statement. Results for the quarter were well ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by strong holiday sales and robust guest demand, which accelerated post holiday.Sales growth across both physical and digital channels were stronger than expected, resulting in less gross margin deleverage than planned and greater SG&amp;A leverage. As a result, operating margin increased to 13.9% for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 18.2%, driven by 15.6% growth in comp sales and strong new store performance.In addition, other revenue increased $18 million, primarily due to credit card income growth and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target. The growth in comp sales was primarily a result of a 13.6% increase in transactions driven by double-digit growth in store traffic. Average ticket increased 1.8% driven by higher average selling price, which more than offset lower units per transaction. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, sales moderated in November from the third quarter trend as we lapped more challenging comparisons, but well-executed holiday plans drove strong results and momentum that accelerated in January. Post-holiday results benefited from robust guest traffic in stores and the lapping of weather and impacts from COVID-19 variants during the same period last year. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores, relocated 1 and remodeled 12 stores.For the quarter, gross margin was flat compared to the same period last year at 37.6%. Leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts and strong growth in other revenue were offset by higher inventory shrink. The impact of promotional activity was flat compared to last year.Consistent with trends we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, in the fourth quarter, robust top line growth delivered significant fixed cost leverage. Channel mix was favorable as the penetration of e-commerce sales was about 270 basis points lower than last year, and solid growth in other revenue was primarily driven by increased credit card income and royalties earned through our Target partnership.SG&amp;A increased 17% to $763 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A decreased 20 basis points to 23.6% compared to 23.8% last year, primarily due to leverage in marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead.Marketing expenses during the quarter were lower as a percentage of sales compared to the same period last year. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we offset the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. We will begin to cycle this change in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Incentive compensation drove 50 basis points of leverage in the quarter, primarily driven by higher sales and a shift in the timing of bonus accruals for store associates. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense was higher than the same period last year, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR and other IT capabilities, UB Media and Ulta Beauty at Target.Store payroll and benefits spend in the quarter was higher than last year driven by an increase in the number of store associates and higher average wage rates. Operating margin was 13.9% compared to 13.8% last year. Healthy top line growth driven primarily by stores combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts supported better operating margin performance.The company's tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year. A higher effective tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from income tax accounting for share-based compensation and state tax credits.Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68 compared to $5.41 last year.To recap the full year, net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion. Comp sales increased 15.6% driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 400 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit increased to 16.1% of sales primarily driven by strong revenue growth, and diluted EPS increased 33.5% to a record $24.01 per share.Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 7% to $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 47 new stores, the increase reflects inventory purchases to support new brand launches and brand expansions as well as the impact of inventory cost increases.Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. Our capital allocation philosophy remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders.In fiscal 2022, we invested $312 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $136 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $74 million for IT, $70 million for supply chain, and $32 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $241 million compared to $268 million last year primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense.During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 722,000 shares at a cost of $328 million, bringing total share repurchases to $900 million for the year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we purchased more than 16 million shares at a weighted average price of $293, effectively returning $4.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers.Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2023. We ended fiscal 2022 with strong momentum and are confident the U.S. beauty category will remain healthy. Our financial expectations reflect this optimism but are risk adjusted to reflect an uncertain macro environment, increasing competitive pressures and the reality that we will lap 2 years of stronger-than-expected performance.Specifically for fiscal 2023, we plan to open between 25 and 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 existing stores. As we shared on our last earnings call, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of openings are expected to shift between fiscal 2023 and 2024 as we navigate these external challenges.We expect net sales will increase 7% to 8% with comp sales growth between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth in the first half will be in the upper single-digit range driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and then moderate to low single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin for the year will be between 14.7% and 15% of sales driven primarily by SG&amp;A deleverage, reflecting investments to support our strategic priorities and higher store expenses as well as ongoing wage pressures.We expect gross margin will deleverage modestly as we lap benefits from the timing of retail price changes in 2022 and plan for a more normalized promotional environment in 2023. We expect to invest an incremental $60 million to $70 million to support our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, our digital store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. In fiscal 2022, we invested $52 million to support our strategic agenda.These assumptions result in guidance for diluted earnings per share in the range of $24.70 to $25.40 per share, including the impact of approximately $900 million in share repurchases. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share.Finally, we plan to spend between $400 million to $475 million in CapEx, including approximately $200 million to $220 million for supply chain and IT; $155 million to $205 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; and $45 million to $50 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $245 million to $250 million.In closing, our business has recovered from the pandemic faster than initially expected. Our annual net sales this year exceeded $10 billion, which is 2 years earlier than planned and when combined with our ongoing efforts to optimize our model, has enabled record profitability. In fiscal 2022, operating margin was a record 16.1% of sales as compared to 12.1% in fiscal 2019 driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, higher merchandise margin and other revenue growth, partially offset by shrink and channel mix.While stronger revenue growth has resulted in a meaningful improvement compared to pre-pandemic levels, our efforts to optimize our model through this period of disruption are delivering sustainable benefits. As a result, we are updating our expectations for operating margins. We remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth between 3% to 5% but now believe we can maintain operating margins between 14% to 15% of sales over the next few years. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns.And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneI think you mentioned there were 5 points of pricing that you got in the comp for Q4. How should we think about the role of higher prices in the 2023 comp guide?David C. KimbellKate, yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we -- 500 basis points in Q4 similar to Q3. The pricing, what we anticipate for pricing going forward into 2023 is a more normalized level. 2022 is really unprecedented across the category. We believe that, that will return to kind of more steady state level of price increases going forward or at least into 2023.So that is included in our comp guidance and is, in part, driving the stronger first half versus second half. As Scott mentioned, high single digits in the first half, lower single digits in the second half. One contributor to that is lapping price increases. Many of them happened through the second quarter into the third quarter last year. So as we lap those, the comparables get a little tougher. So it's incorporated in our guidance, and we anticipate it being at a more moderate normalized rate going forward.OperatorOur next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.Anthony Chinonye ChukumbaCongrats on an incredibly strong year. I was intrigued by your comments about, I guess, this luxury department is -- or expanding the luxury beauty offering in select stores and online. What exactly does that look like? Because when I think about Ulta, particularly where you are now versus where you were, let's say, 10 years ago, you have a ton of luxury brands. So if you can just help me sort of dimensionalize that.David C. KimbellAbsolutely. Thanks for the question. We are excited about the luxury opportunity, and we have been participating in luxury for a while. We've had a long-term relationship with Chanel, among many other brands. But what's evolving and changing is an expanded presence of luxury in select stores and online. We recently launched Dior in makeup and skin care. We had the Dior fragrance business. So Dior is another along with Chanel, key anchors of our expanded luxury business.NATASHA DENONA, which is a beautiful and elevated color brand; HOURGLASS, Chanel N°1, Lancôme Absolue, we believe other luxury brands over time, now that complements a portfolio of luxury fragrance brands that we have, including YSL, TOM FORD, Gucci and others. And so the effort here is to make a stronger statement in luxury that further reinforces our All Things Beauty all in one place.The idea that you can shop across all price points, all categories and luxury, while we had a presence, we felt there was an opportunity to expand and solidify. And that's the actions we've been taking so far this year, and we're really encouraged by the results of the launch of several of these brands including Dior and excited about the opportunity ahead.OperatorOur next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.Christopher Michael HorversSo a couple of related questions about the business momentum. You talked about the acceleration in January. If you teased out the Omicron lap and weather, was there an underlying acceleration? You also lapped the launch of Fenty and OLAPLEX into the first quarter. How did that play out relative to your expectations? Did it sort of -- did the business slow in line with the lift that you saw last year? Or did it do better? And then last related question is, as you think about the high single-digit comp guide in the first quarter, are you essentially assuming that from today forward to the balance of the year the business comps in line with the annual guide?David C. KimbellLet's see. So a few things in that. First of all, yes, January was elevated, as Scott said there. And there were multiple factors. It's hard to nail down exact drivers, exact -- the exact elements of the contribution, but you mentioned a few, Omicron, lapping Omicron being one of those. And -- but we -- the underlying consumer engagement was strong as we emerged out of holiday. There's no doubt about that. The importance of the category, the elevated connection between beauty and wellness is showing up in January and gives us confidence as we go into the year.We are lapping some major launches, OLAPLEX in January. Fenty, actually, the launch happened in Q1 of last year, so that launch was not lapped in January but will be lapped here in the first quarter. And as we look into the year, again, the outlook that we have is 4% to 5% comp growth, stronger in the first half -- higher in the first half, a double digit -- I'm sorry, high single digits -- excuse me, high single digit in the first half of the year, lower single digit in the second half of the year leading to the 4% to 5% comp guidance for the full year. The drivers, again, of that are import pricing, some continued momentum coming out of the strength we saw in January and other factors that lead to a bit stronger in the first half of the year.OperatorOur next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantCongratulations on the quarter and the year and the great start to the new year. David, I guess -- well, actually -- so I'll start with kind of a question about the model itself. So pre-COVID, sales per gross square foot was kind of averaging in the $500 a square foot and at that time, sort of the potential margin at 15%. We're now kind of post COVID in that $800 a square foot range. And it looks like these are new TAM bolt-on services, BIPOC, Conscious Beauty. It doesn't look skin care -- it doesn't seem like there's kind of a replacement or a shift going on. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about the 15% sustainable margin and how we should think about sort of that on a longer-term basis after you get through the investment phase.Scott M. SetterstenYes, Adrienne. Maybe I'll just give that a slightly different spin. So again, as we said, we're confident that we can deliver now adjusted 14% to 15% operating margin on a 3% to 5% comp for the next few years. Again, we came -- at our Analyst Day back in late fall 2021, we were giving our point of view on the financial model through the end of 2024. So since then, a lot of things have changed. I think less so on the sales drivers because there's a lot -- again, this category provides a lot of opportunities for us to drive the top line through various means.Really, the change is versus 2019, a lot are in the infrastructure, the cost infrastructure of the business overall. So you've probably heard us refer to some of this in the past. So we -- of course, we benefited here over the last couple of years from double-digit sales growth, driving a lot of fixed cost leverage across the business. There's also been a more rational promotional environment the last couple of years. And so -- and these elevated sales levels have also mitigated some of the other inflationary cost pressures that we are experiencing across the business.So as we look to 2023, we expect sales growth to moderate from where it's been the last couple of years. And so that will -- that's going to drive some deleverage. That's our year-over-year tougher comparisons. We've described that. I mean, as we think about, again, stronger and sustainable operating margins, we just feel like the business is in a much healthier position today than it was back in 2019.Again, we've described improved capabilities across the business, like ship from store and BOPIS helping to do that. Our ESG initiative that we started years ago now are continuing to drive significant benefits to the business overall. And we believe that, coupled with some of the new initiatives that we have along the lines of continuous improvement and some of the other long-term strategic investments we're making for the business, help give us comfort that we can hold on to those stronger margins with a 3% to 5% comp over the next few years.OperatorOur next question is from Kelly Crago with Citi.Kelly CragoI was wondering if you could talk a little bit about category growth and break down how you're looking at growth by category in F '23. And then just talk about some of the opportunities you have in skin. I think at 17% of sales, you indexed lower than the beauty category overall. So just curious if you have any initiatives in place to expand. I think you talked about maybe eyeing some square footage in stores dedicated to skin care. So anything else from like a brand perspective? Any partnerships there? Would be helpful.David C. KimbellGreat. Yes. Of course, our assortment is key to our success. One of the things that's really encouraging to us and again, gives us confidence moving forward is our performance has been broad-based. We're seeing double-digit growth across all major categories. And as we look forward into 2023, we see good healthy momentum in each of the categories. So we feel confident.And fundamentally, it's driven by a overarching beauty trend and understanding of the power and importance of beauty and how it connects to overall wellness and self-care. That elevated connection, the increased emotional connection and the importance that beauty plays is fueling the entire category. And that's what's helping drive each element in each individual subcategory within the total beauty space.So we feel clearly good about what 2022 looked like and have good optimism going forward. A lot of newness, a lot of activity across each of our major categories. We've got newness in makeup and in hair care and fragrance. We'll continue to drive innovation in things we're excited about.Skin care is -- as we mentioned in the script, was our fastest-growing category. We had double-digit growth in each category, but skin care led the way. And we feel like there's even more opportunity. We've launched new products like Drunk Elephant. We've had great growth with The Ordinary, Hero Cosmetics. We have in our newest store design that we started rolling out last year. We brought skin care together, and our other categories, makeup with skin care and a more prominent front-of-store location that allows our guests to engage across all price points in a really elevated, beautiful way.We're bringing new brands in. We just launched a partnership, an exclusive partnership with Beautycounter, which spans both color and skin care but has a very strong skin care presence. So we'll bring innovation across all parts of the business, and we see strong trends, most of which are rooted in wellness and overall health and self-care, which we think will drive each of the categories in a positive way going into 2023.OperatorOur next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanI hope you can hear me, and well done on 2022. Scott, I may have missed this, but I heard modest deleverage on gross margin. I don't know if you gave any framework for that. But if this math is right, down 50 or so, it means SG&amp;A dollars would be up around 8%. And if those are roughly right numbers, can you get us the building blocks to why SG&amp;A is up that much? And then obviously, if gross is down even less, then the dollars are greater. It just seems like a big amount. I'm curious what the building blocks are.Scott M. SetterstenSure, Simeon. So yes, we expect operating margin is going to be leveraged in fiscal 2023 compared to last year driven by slight deleverage in gross margin, but the primary lever is going to be SG&amp;A. That's where most of the pressure will come from during the year. We expect gross margin, again, modest deleverage there as we lap benefits and the timing of retail price increases during 2022, and we plan for a more normalized promotional environment overall. Those headwinds will probably be offset by growth in other revenue and continued fixed cost leverage.So on the SG&amp;A side, it really comes down to continuing our efforts with our strategic investments, our strategic initiatives across the business. So again, last year, we got out of the gates on most all of those things, Project SOAR being the largest by far but Digital Store of the Future, UB Media. There are a number of other digital investments across the business, so really getting into the thick of it, I guess, I would say, during 2023, so that's the primary driver of it.But there's also inflationary pressures in store expenses. And of course, we referenced the wage pressure as well, and most of that falls through to our field teams, which is recognized in our SG&amp;A line. So that's it by far.I'd say overall, we feel good about where we are. We've got a good plan. We think it's balanced in all ways and takes recognition of both the opportunities we have but also the risks that we see in 2023.OperatorOur next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Jungwon KimThis is Jonna on for Oliver. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of the promotional environment broader in the industry and you talked about normalizing promo levels. But what are your strategies as you think about 2023?David C. KimbellYes. We -- in the fourth quarter, we saw, we'd call it, rational promotional intensity. It was relatively flat to the previous year, still down versus 2019. And of course, as we -- I guess, we probably have said several times, Q4 is an elevated promotional quarter because of the role of holiday and the gifting and the competition that we have with all gifting, not just within beauty. So -- but nothing extraordinary in Q4.As we look into this fiscal year, we do see that continue to normalize. The step down of the improvements that we've made versus 2019 over the last couple of years will moderate somewhat. We won't continue the pace of improvement. We'll see a more normalized level of promotion, not back to previous pre-pandemic levels, but it is a competitive environment. There are added points of distribution, brands, bringing newness and innovation and competing. So we would anticipate, as I said, a somewhat normalized level of promotion but not in a rational level of promotion as we look going forward.OperatorOur next question is from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Group.Dana Lauren TelseyMaking sure you can hear me okay. As you think about the levels of strength that are out there and obviously was incorporated into the results, how are you looking at that for 2023? And what are you baking in? And then just on pricing, where the expectation to go to a more normalized pricing cadence, what do you see in that more normalized pricing cadence of increases? And does it differ by category?Kecia L. SteelmanMaybe I'll start, Dana. Like you're hearing from the broader retail industry, organized retail crime and shrink is a real issue out there, and we're not immune to what's happening. The concern is really twofold. Firstly, it's about safety and well-being of our associates and our guests. The news groups are coming in to the stores. It's really upsetting and can take an emotional toll on everyone that's involved. And secondly, as you mentioned, it's clearly a financial impact to our bottom line. We're continuing to invest in measures to not only deter but catch those who are conducting these activities. So the investments are around increasing our talent level, targeting our payroll in both our store and our loss prevention team, testing new technology, and then also installing new fixtures that can protect some of our key categories. Fragrance is the one we're really leaning into right now.What we're seeing is when we're investing in these locked cases in fragrance, we're seeing sales go up and shrink goes down. And our associates are very, very thankful for this because it's really deterring these bad actors from coming into our stores. We're going to be at 75% of the chain by the end of the year with these new fixtures. And then in regards to what the shrink impact is, it's about 70 basis points of headwinds that we had in 2022 to gross margin, and we're proactively taking these steps, as I mentioned before, to make sure that we understand these macro factors are going to continue to persist, but we're looking at only a modest benefit and shrink improvement in 2023.David C. KimbellAnd on the pricing side, we don't see any real differences by category. What we saw in 2022 was really broad-based across categories because the inflationary pressures for brands was -- really impacted all segments. So as we look forward, by normalize, we mean every year in beauty over time, there's a percentage of brands that go through just more standard price increases, and we anticipate kind of going back into that. And we think it will be across categories.OperatorOur next question would be from Mark Altschwager with Baird.Mark R. AltschwagerSo it sounds like things are going great with Target. Just any color you can provide on the incrementality of that new Target customer that may be returning to Ulta? And then separately, I know there's been some supply chain delays impacting your store openings, but just wondering if you could provide a broader update on how you view the store runway and perhaps how any of the learnings from the Target relationship are impacting the pace of openings over the next few years.Kecia L. SteelmanI'll go ahead and start. And what I would say is that we've got 3 areas of really concentrated efforts in our partnership with the Ulta Beauty and Target partnership. First is about deepening the guest engagement. It's really focusing on new guest acquisition, increasing the spend of the existing linked Circle and Ulta Beauty reward members in engaging that lapsed member. When we see the Ulta Beauty at Target member coming in and engaging with Ulta Beauty itself, what we're seeing is we like what their spend patterns look like. They're at our average spend, if not, even higher. So we like what we're seeing from the ecosystem.In regards to new store growth, I mean, listen, we've got competition out there always on in regards to where we're opening up new stores. So we are looking at this as part of the ecosystem where we actually would even have, in some locations, Ulta Beauty at Target in the same center as an Ulta Beauty store. And what we're seeing is that's really -- it's performing very nicely that the customer is shopping in both.So while there's competition out there, it's not necessarily playing into what our new store opening guidelines looks like. Maybe you want to weigh in on the supply chain with supplies for new stores.Scott M. SetterstenYes. So for our new store outlook, our long-term outlook, still 1,500 to 1,700 stores with roughly 800 Ulta Beauty at Target locations on top of that. So again, we're still very comfortable from everything we've seen, the interaction between, as Kecia just described, between the shop in shops and what we're doing in our stand-alone stores, are happy with the overall performance.Again, this year, there's just a shift or just smart business, we think, not chasing a number with new store openings and trying to be wise about how we plan that to make sure we keep good disciplines on site selection and the cost ramifications because these are long-term investments.David C. KimbellAll right. Great. Well, thank you all for your interest and engagement today. And I want to close by thanking all 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering just excellent financial results in 2022 while executing against our strategic priorities. I am excited about the future of Ulta Beauty and believe firmly in our differentiated business model, strategic framework and talented and committed teams will continue to drive success and create significant shareholder value.We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 on May 25. Have a good evening and talk to you all soon. Thanks.OperatorThank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.]"

The data in question is, as most everyone knows by now, the long-awaited Employment Situation report from the U.S. government; the direction of trading is decidedly down.This is more or less getting a lead-off of first base, with expectations for tomorrow’s jobs numbers projected to hamper market trading on the news. This would speak to a higher-than-expected nonfarm payrolls number Friday morning, which would mean 225K new jobs filled in February or more. It would also suggest January’s mammoth 517K jobs gain, which surprised everyone when the numbers came out, would not be significantly revised downward.If this “lead-off” is incorrect, however, it provides an excellent opportunity for market participants to buy into oversold equities — all four major indices are -2% to -4% lower over the past five trading days. A poor showing in tomorrow’s Employment Situation, in our current “bad news is good news” environment, may provide a pop to stocks as early as the report’s release. So have yourself situated properly bright and early tomorrow morning.In any case, the Dow sold off -541 points for the session, -1.65% — and it was the outperformer. The S&amp;P 500 slid -1.85% on the day and the Nasdaq shed -1.98%. Worst hit of all was the small-cap Russell 2000, -2.81% on the day. We’ve experienced almost a straight shot downward since March 3rd, with the Dow on a three-day slide. Each of the indices is -4%, save the Nasdaq, which is -3.24% over that time.Oracle ORCL is out with fiscal Q3 earnings after today’s close, beating estimates on the bottom line by two cents per share to $1.22 (ahead of the year-ago $1.13 per share reported) on revenues of $12.40 billion which were a smidge above the Zacks consensus. Cloud business was good in the quarter, although On Premise disappointed expectations (or at least the whisper number). Shares were down more than -5% on the news.Ulta Beauty ULTA smashed estimates on the bottom line, reporting earnings of $6.68 per share, way past the $5.64 in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $3.2 billion also topped expectations for $3.02 billion in the quarter, as the company spoke of “strength and resiliency in the beauty business.” However, shares are down -2.5% in late trading on slowing store growth, even as guidance was ratcheted up. Ulta shares had grown 10% year to date.The Gap GPS missed expectations on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, reporting -75 cents per share versus -59 cents expected, and well below the -$0.02 reported in the year-ago quarter. Sales came in at $4.24 billion, missing the $4.33 billion anticipated, as same-store sales were down -5% in the quarter. To add to the company’s challenges, its Athleta CEO is stepping down immediately, and the board has yet to decide on a new CEO at this time.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

This compares to earnings of $5.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17.40%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this beauty products retailer would post earnings of $4.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.34, delivering a surprise of 30.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Ulta , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $3.23 billion for the quarter ended January 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.22%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.73 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Ulta shares have added about 11.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4%.What's Next for Ulta?While Ulta has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ulta: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $6.46 on $2.49 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $24.31 on $10.79 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

We have Gap, Alta, DocuSign, and Oracle.Kicking off with Gap, and you can see a lot of red on your screen here. Gap off just about 6% following its miss on both the top and bottom lines. Wider-than-expected loss here for Gap.Also reported declining sales, more executive shakeups, and total comp sales declining about 5%. Certainly seeing a pullback in consumer spending in the face of higher prices.So we're looking at an extended loss of just about 6% over the last three months. Gap shares are off about 16% over the last year. The loss slightly worse, off just about 20%.Let's take a look at Ulta. That stock also under a bit of pressure here despite relatively strong results here. Just a slight miss. Price hikes helping Ulta here. Fourth-quarter comp sales jumping 15.6%, blowing away the Street's expectations. But margin and also unit growth, those forecasts just trailing the Street's estimates over the last year. You can certainly see Ulta far outperforming the broader market with gains of nearly 40%. We talk time and time again that people continue to spend on their makeup. They're not willing to give it up just yet.Let's take a look at DocuSign. That stock off just about 6% here in after-hours trading. Q1 billings forecast, that missed the Street's expectations. Revenue, though, for his most recent quarter actually beating the Street's expectations, $659.6 million. Also profit-adjusted EPS, $0.65. That was also a beat.CFO Cynthia Gaylor will be stepping down from her position, another executive shakeup. Over the last year-- we know DocuSign was a pandemic darling. Certainly has been under pressure here over the last year, off just about 34%.Wrapping up with Oracle. That stock off nearly 5% in extended trading. Take a look at some of these numbers. The company did increase its dividend, which is good news there for shareholders, by 25% to $0.40 a share, but 3Q sales just missed the Street's expectations, and doesn't look like the Street was impressed with its cloud revenue growth. It did rise 45% to $4.1 billion, but some slowing growth there obviously an issue for the Street.We're looking at extended losses of about 5%. Over the last year, though, Oracle staying in the green, up just about 14%, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, Seana, thank you. Good job.]"

Shares have lost about 2.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Vertex due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales BeatVertex reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.76 for fourth-quarter 2022, up 25% year over year. The adjusted earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $3.53 and $3.32, respectively. Strong cystic fibrosis (“CF”) product revenues boosted earnings.Revenues of $2.30 billion surpassed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $2.29 billion and $2.26 billion, respectively. Total product rose 11% year over year, primarily driven by higher international sales of Trikafta (marketed as Kaftrio in Europe).CF product sales rose 5% year over year in the United States to $1.46 billion, while sales outside the United States surged 24% to $842 million.Trikafta generated sales worth $2.02 billion, up 19.4% year over year, driven by strong uptakes in international markets with recently secured reimbursement agreements as well as expanded use for younger age groups in the United States as well as ex U.S. Vertex received reimbursement for Trikafta for six to 11 years age group in countries such as France and Spain. Trikafta sales also beat our model estimate of $1.99 billion.Vertex estimates that there are still more than 20,000 CF patients who can benefit from its CFTR modulator therapies. These include patients in countries where Vertex is early on the launch curve and younger patients for whom Vertex is pursuing additional label and reimbursement approvals.Symdeko/Symkevi registered sales of $34 million in the quarter, down 57.5% year over year.Kalydeco recorded sales of $136 million in the quarter, down 10.5% year over year. Orkambi generated sales of $111 million in the reported quarter, down 24.5% from the prior-year quarter. Sales of Kalydeco, Symdeko/Symkevi and Orkambi were hurt by patients switching to Trikafta.Story continuesCosts RiseAdjusted operating expense was $872 million in the quarter, up 5% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.Adjusted research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 26.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $623 million due to Vertex’s expanding mid- and late-stage pipeline. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased 7.6% to $226 million in the reported quarter due to expenses for CF launches and pre-commercial activities for exa-cel.During the fourth quarter, Vertex recorded acquired IPR&amp;D costs of $23 million compared with $127 million in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating income was $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15% from the prior-year period.Full-Year 2022 ResultsFor 2022, Vertex generated revenues of $8.9 billion, reflecting 18% growth year over year.For the same period, the company reported earnings of $14.88 per share, up 54% year over year.2023 GuidanceThe company expects total revenues from CF products in the range of $9.55-$9.70 billion for 2023, suggesting 7-9% year-over-year growth. The product revenue guidance reflects only revenues from cystic fibrosis products and does not include any revenues from exa-celVertex expects revenue growth in 2023 to be driven by continued strong performance of Trikafta/Kaftrio in all major markets, further uptake in international markets with recent reimbursement agreements and expansion into younger patient populations. Vertex expects FDA approval/launch for Trikafta for CF patients aged 2-5 in 2023 (PDUFA Date: April 28) to also boost 2023 revenues.Combined adjusted R&amp;D, acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense for 2023 is expected in the range of $3.9-$4.0 billion. The guidance includes approximately 300 million of upfronts and milestones from known collaborations, including the expected upfront payment in the first quarter from Entrada.The adjusted tax rate is expected in the range of 21-22%. Currency headwinds are expected to have a negative impact of approximately 1.5% on revenue growth in 2023.Share Repurchase ProgramOn Feb 1, Vertex’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of its common stock.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -16.45% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Vertex has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Vertex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shaw said he was ‘deeply sorry’ for the freight train derailment that spilled toxic chemicals affecting the community of East Palestine, Ohio, and the surrounding area.Shaw told the Senate panel that he would make a ‘personal commitment’ to cleaning up the environmental disaster and help the residents affected. He stopped short, however, when pressed by several senators, of specifying exactly what help he was going to provide, especially on the question of any monetary damages.Just hours before Shaw’s testimony, Norfolk Southern reported that another one of its trains was involved in an accident. Over thirty freight cars ran off the tracks in Calhoun County, Alabama about an hour outside of Birmingham. There were no reports of injuries or any hazardous chemical leak. The accident is Norfolk Southern’s fourth derailment in five weeks.Key video highlights:0:11 Norfolk Southern CEO says he’s “deeply sorry”0:55 CEO Shaw: we'll be there as long as it takes1:12 Sen.

I am determined to make this right.DEBRA SHORE: We've used one of EPA's most powerful enforcement tools to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and to require the company to clean up the mess it made.TOM CARPER: Will you commit that Norfolk Southern will be there for as long as it takes to make East Palestine, Ohio, Darlington Township in Pennsylvania, and the surrounding communities whole from this disaster, yes or no.Story continuesALAN SHAW: Yes. It's my personal commitment and Norfolk Southern's commitment that we're going to be there for as long as it takes to help East Palestine thrive and recover.TOM CARPER: That's the answer I was looking for.ALAN SHAW: We're going to be there today, tomorrow, a year from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now.BERNIE SANDERS: I have been told by workers who work for your company and other rail companies that they are now being asked to do more work with fewer workers. And that includes safety inspections. So well before this disaster in East Palestine, we have been told about the potential safety hazards.ALAN SHAW: Senator, in December of last year, I charted a new course in the industry. And I said we're going to move away from a near-term focus solely on profits.JD VANCE: Our leadership, our media, and our politicians were slow to respond to this crisis, in part because a certain segment of our leadership feels like the people of East Palestine are a little out of style. They have the wrong politics. They're a little too rural, maybe a little too white.ED MARKEY: Will you commit to compensating effective homeowners for their diminished property values?ALAN SHAW: Pardon me. Senator, I'm committing to do what's right.ED MARKEY: Well, what's right is a family that had a home worth $100,000 that is now worth $50,000 will probably never be able to sell that home for $100,000 again. Will you compensate that family for that loss?ALAN SHAW: Senator, I'm committing to do what's right.ED MARKEY: That is the right thing to do. These are the people who are innocent victims.JOSEPH SCHOFER: My concern going forward is, what are the causes? What's fundamental here? And what should motivate changes? As I watch the news coverage, it looks like every politician from the local level to the federal level is trying to jump in front of the camera and say, I'm going to save your lives. But we really don't have a good sense of the scope of the problem.MUSTAFA SANTIAGO ALI: Well, we have to make our transportation as safe as possible. Most folks may not know that we've got 140,000 miles of railway, 100,000 folks in rural communities. Those communities are made up of lower wealth white communities and farmers and Indigenous brothers and sisters and communities of color. So we've got to make sure that folks have a clear understanding of what's moving through their backyards, or front yards in some instances, and what the dangers could be.ANTHONY HATCH: It's sort of ironic that this railroad, which had sort of the overall the historic best safety record, a railroad that in their investor conference in December pledged to do things differently with their stakeholders, including labor and shippers-- their safety record is actually pretty remarkable. 99.99% get through. I guess instead of being thankful that it could have been worse, we're sort of attacking them as being unsafe. And that seems unfair.]"

The investigative team identified these wheels as coming from a series of recently acquired cars from a specific manufacturer. Although the investigation into the cause of the accident is still underway, we immediately notified the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration and began inspecting other cars from this series on our network.Upon identifying additional cases of unusual wheel movement, we acted swiftly.  We issued orders to remove these cars from service until their wheelsets could be replaced, and we have taken steps to remove this specific model and series from service until they can be fully inspected. We also notified the manufacturer and worked urgently to inform the rest of the railroad industry, as Norfolk Southern is not the only user of these cars. As a result, the Association of American Railroads issued an advisory to halt the use of these cars. Norfolk Southern will continue to investigate this matter and take appropriate action.About Norfolk SouthernSince 1827, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) and its predecessor companies have safely moved the goods and materials that drive the U.S. economy.

""We have gotten all the information from them.""Homendy said the NTSB was investigating a new derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in Alabama on Thursday because it may have had two of those cars with potentially loose wheels.Norfolk Southern had 517 railcars in use with the wheels at issue, she added.""They put a message out to stop if those are on your train, inspect them, get the wheelsets replaced...immediately,"" Homendy said, noting that was a costly task.Norfolk Southern did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

To be clear, there are no strings attached to our assistance. If residents have a concern, we want them to come talk to us. Our website, nsmakingitright.com, provides the latest information and details on how to reach us. We have been cooperating fully with the NTSB's investigation into the cause of the derailment. The preliminary report found that the Norfolk Southern crew was operating the train below the speed limit and in an approved manner. Yet, it is clear the safety mechanisms in place were not enough.SEANA SMITH: That was Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw testifying on Capitol Hill today, detailing the rail company's efforts to clean up last month's chemical spill in East Palestine, Ohio. Now, joining us to discuss this and much more, we want to bring in ABH Consulting Senior Transportation Analyst Tony Hatch. Tony, it's great to see you here. So the latest comments that we heard from CEO Alan Shaw, what did you think?ANTHONY HATCH: Well, that was a tough couple of hours there. I was shocked at how little people seemed to want to learn, but rather just say things. I thought Shaw did a good job. He had to know what he was going to face, and I thought he did a good job. And I thought really all the presenters at that panel-- the EPA, OH EPA, and the EMT-- all did a good job at that.DAVE BRIGGS: This is not likely a short fix for them, given the long-term health implications of the residents there in Ohio. What do you think the impact will be on Norfolk Southern?ANTHONY HATCH: Financially, it will not be very large. It's a reputational hit. And it's just unfortunate that it comes after a period of which there were service issues and the supply chain issues that they were part of, very contentious labor negotiations that they just finished. So it sort of adds to the sense that railroads aren't really doing their job, when in fact, the fact that they have such a good safety record is why they carry this.Story continuesIt was Norfolk Southern who tried to get out from this common carrier obligation, saying that the risks were so great of carrying hazardous materials. But in essence, the government said, no, you must because the alternative, the highway, is so much worse. You know, people keep saying, why are they allowed to do this? And my answer is, they're not allowed to, they're compelled to.So it is going to be a reputational hit. Financially, they'll be able to do this. There were no casualties. They'll get the-- from a building stock point of view, that's all manageable. We'll see with the long-term impacts. You know, I'm not an expert on the side of high hopes that with the EPA, the Ohio EPA, and Norfolk Southern's money, they can resolve the long-term impacts of these leaks.DAVE BRIGGS: So, Tony, is your suggestion that this is more of a federal government issue than it is a Norfolk Southern one?ANTHONY HATCH: Well, that's probably overstating it. I mean, they have to carry these. They have every incentive to carry them safely. Look at what's happened to them, also to, of course, the poor citizens of the town. I'm just saying it's just ironic that of this railroad, which had the, overall, the historic best safety record, a railroad that, in their investor conference in December, pledged to do things differently with their stakeholders, including labor and shippers, this was the railroad here that had led the fight against having to carry these goods in the aughts. And so this is the railroad that has an accident.These things, unfortunately, happen from time to time. It was-- it appears to be a bearing failure, which is unseeable to the human eye as you walk past it. And they have hotbox detectors. Now they'll have more of them. Their safety record is actually pretty remarkable. 99.99% get through. It's just-- I guess instead of being thankful, that it could have been worse, we're sort of attacking them as being unsafe. And that seems unfair.But the federal government and the shippers of the product also bear responsibility in this. These goods go to a factory where people work to be used, or they go to chlorine for drinking water. People want those things. They want chemical factories to be open. They want water to be clean. Railroads have the responsibility to carry them because the highway is worse. It's just, nobody seemed to mention that as they all took-- since all of the senators took turns, you know, grandstanding. It was very disappointing for me as a US citizen to see that part of the hearings today.DAVE BRIGGS: US senators grandstanding at a hearing, Tony? Say it ain't so. I mean, that has pretty much become their job recently. But Norfolk Southern has had another derailment since the one in East Palestine. CSX had one on Wednesday that's now put oil into one of our oldest rivers that's part of the National Park Service. Are there more derailments as of late or just more focus on them by the media? You talked about Norfolk's safety record.ANTHONY HATCH: The latter. The derailments-- if you look at the track record since deregulation in 1980, since the turn of the century, since the start of-- over the last 10 years, pick your poison-- that's a terrible phrase-- you'll see the track record gets better. It's really good business to stay on the tracks. Norfolk Southern also had a third incident since-- that you didn't mention, which a truck hit it.You remember that a large part of these accidents are often non-rail people getting in the way of moving freight trains on private property. In this case, at Cleveland-Cliffs, a dump truck hit a Norfolk Southern locomotive. Think about how out of control you have to be to do that. And unfortunately, there was a fatality, unlike the other instances you mentioned.Right now, anything that happens is going to get a lot of attention. The locomotive turns over, and you can see the logo on the side. These things happen to the tune of several times a day. Mostly, it's a wheel that slips off the track. That's not good for the railroad either. It closes the main line down, let's say. It tears up the track, costs a lot of money. Mostly, they don't happen in this way, where you need controlled explosions under the glare of the camera lights--DAVE BRIGGS: If they weren't busy-- if they weren't so busy, Tony, grandstanding, what would you like to see from our nation's senators and congressmen and women?ANTHONY HATCH: Well, the-- most of the proposals, ironically, that they've talked about in the bill so far and the DoT secretary's letter would be solving problems that don't have-- that had nothing to do with this or solving problems that may not even exist. The issues that they discussed, for example, Senator Sanders talked about paid sick leave. There was no sign that these three employees in the cab were sick. That's completely unrelated. So is train length. So are ECP brakes. They don't work as well as air brakes, even though they are more modern technology.I don't know what I want the government to do. The FRA and the government should take a look at the final NTSB report and then make actions. The things they're talking about now are just so they can say that they're ""doing something."" But the NTSB is a highly respected organization that is apolitical and is scientific. And when they make a recommendation, that's what-- when things should be done. NS has already said they're going to do more hot boxes, which detect failed bearings in these things. And if they do that, that'll be helpful and something they could do. That's a voluntary program, by the way.I'm not sure what a regulatory-- what in regulations could be done under the existing rules or even the ones that are proposed that would have changed this outcome. When the NTSB said, oh, this accident is preventable, they meant all accidents are preventable. This was a series of very bad luck. Or if you think about the fact that nobody got hurt, maybe good luck. One way you could stop it is not move these goods. But then you'd shut a lot of factories down.DAVE BRIGGS: Right. Great context there. Tony Hatch, ABH Consulting. Appreciate all that. Thanks so much.]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Coca-Cola Consolidated's (NASDAQ:COKE) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Coca-Cola Consolidated, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$635m ÷ (US$3.7b - US$905m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Coca-Cola Consolidated has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Beverage industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated roceWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you're interested in investigating Coca-Cola Consolidated's past further, check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Can We Tell From Coca-Cola Consolidated's ROCE Trend?Coca-Cola Consolidated's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 443% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Coca-Cola Consolidated's ROCETo sum it up, Coca-Cola Consolidated is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Let me explain –The first stock pays its dividend in January, April, July, and October. The second stock pays out in February, May, August, and November. And finally, the third stock will pay its dividend in March, June, September, and December.So, with just a little positioning, investors can reap steady monthly paydays.Together, three stocks – Coca-Cola Company, AbbVie and Exxon Mobil – would allow payouts to roll in each month.For income-focused investors, let’s take a closer look at each one.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola is an American multinational corporation best known for its flagship Coca-Cola beverage. The stock presently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings estimates drifting higher.Impressively, KO is a Dividend King, showing an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ years of increased payouts. The company’s annual yield sits at 2.9%, a tick ahead of the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.KO pays dividends in January, April, July, and October.AbbVieAbbVie enjoys leadership positions in key therapeutic areas, including immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, eye care, and women’s health.Like KO, AbbVie is a Dividend King, reflecting the company’s shareholder-friendly nature in a big way. Currently, ABBV’s annual dividend yields a sizable 3.9%, more than double the Zacks Medical sector average.In addition, AbbVie’s cash-generating abilities have been amplified thanks to successful new drugs; ABBV generated $7.2 billion of free cash flow in its latest quarter, growing nearly 50% year-over-year.Story continuesABBV pays dividends in February, May, August, and November.Exxon MobilExxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas entity, one of the world's largest publicly traded energy companies.Exxon’s annual dividend yield currently stands at a solid 3.3%, with a sustainable payout ratio of 26% of its earnings. The surge in energy prices undoubtedly benefitted the company, with its payout growing 3.4% just over the last year.Further, the company’s 31.2% TTM return on equity is certainly worth highlighting, with the surge in energy prices again providing a nice boost.XOM pays dividends in March, June, September, and December.Bottom LineDividends amplify any portfolio, cushioning the impact of drawdowns in other positions and providing the ability to reap passive income.Interestingly enough, if investors select their dividend-paying stocks in a structured manner, they can create a portfolio that provides monthly paydays.When combined, all three stocks above – Coca-Cola Company, AbbVie and Exxon Mobil – construct a portfolio that allows monthly income.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

And finally, the third stock will pay its dividend in March, June, September, and December.So, with just a little positioning, investors can reap steady monthly paydays.Together, three stocks – Coca-Cola Company KO, AbbVie ABBV, and Exxon Mobil XOM – would allow payouts to roll in each month.For income-focused investors, let’s take a closer look at each one.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola is an American multinational corporation best known for its flagship Coca-Cola beverage. The stock presently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings estimates drifting higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressively, KO is a Dividend King, showing an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ years of increased payouts. The company’s annual yield sits at 2.9%, a tick ahead of the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKO pays dividends in January, April, July, and October.AbbVieAbbVie enjoys leadership positions in key therapeutic areas, including immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, eye care, and women’s health.Like KO, AbbVie is a Dividend King, reflecting the company’s shareholder-friendly nature in a big way. Currently, ABBV’s annual dividend yields a sizable 3.9%, more than double the Zacks Medical sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, AbbVie’s cash-generating abilities have been amplified thanks to successful new drugs; ABBV generated $7.2 billion of free cash flow in its latest quarter, growing nearly 50% year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchABBV pays dividends in February, May, August, and November.Exxon MobilExxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas entity, one of the world's largest publicly traded energy companies.Story continuesExxon’s annual dividend yield currently stands at a solid 3.3%, with a sustainable payout ratio of 26% of its earnings. The surge in energy prices undoubtedly benefitted the company, with its payout growing 3.4% just over the last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company’s 31.2% TTM return on equity is certainly worth highlighting, with the surge in energy prices again providing a nice boost.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchXOM pays dividends in March, June, September, and December.Bottom LineDividends amplify any portfolio, cushioning the impact of drawdowns in other positions and providing the ability to reap passive income.Interestingly enough, if investors select their dividend-paying stocks in a structured manner, they can create a portfolio that provides monthly paydays. When combined, all three stocks above – Coca-Cola Company KO, AbbVie ABBV, and Exxon Mobil XOM – construct a portfolio that allows monthly income.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 8.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Incyte due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Incyte's Q4 Earnings and Revenues TopIncyte’s earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter of 2022 on strong Jakafi and newly approved Opzelura.The company reported adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2022, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents, up 10 cents from the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in Jakafi and Opzelura.Total revenues came in at $926.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, increasing by 7% year over year. Sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $889.3 million.Quarter in DetailTotal product and royalty revenues came in at $896.7 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter. Jakafi’s (a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved for polycythemiavera, myelofibrosis and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease) revenues came in at $647.5 million. The figure increased 9% from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $636 million, driven by growth in patient demand across all indications.The newly approved medicine, Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream, generated $61.3 million in sales during the fourth quarter.In July 2022, the FDA approved Opzelura cream 1.5% for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Opzelura is also approved by the FDA for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).More than 84,000 units of Opzelura were shipped in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by strong growth in new patient starts across AD and vitiligo as well as broadening formulary coverage.Story continuesNet product revenues for Iclusig amounted to $27.6 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Pemazyre generated $23 million in sales during the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 17% year over year.Minjuvi revenues came in at $4.8 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Jakavi’s royalty revenues from Novartis for commercialization in ex-U.S. markets declined 5% to $91.2 million.Incyte also receives royalties from the sales of Tabrecta (capmatinib) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Its partner, Novartis, has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights for Tabrecta.Tabrecta’s product royalty revenues came in at $4.2 million, up 36% year over year.Olumiant’s (baricitinib) product royalty revenues from Eli Lilly came in at $35.9 million, down 46% year over year, impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19.Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly for Olumiant. The drug is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to LLY. It is approved for several types of autoimmune diseases.Adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $469 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter, owing to higher investments in late-stage pipeline development. SG&amp;A expenses amounted to $253.2 million, up 21% from the prior-year quarter, due to expenses related to dermatology commercial organizations and activities to support the launch of Opzelura for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.Pipeline and Regulatory UpdatesThe new drug application (NDA) for the ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) formulation was accepted by the FDA with a target action date of Mar 23, 2023.2022 ResultsRevenues came in at $3.39 billion, up 14% from 2021, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36 billion.

Among these, BMRN was down on regulatory updates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Update From Exelixis:  Exelixis EXEL announced the failure of the late-stage CONTACT-03 study. CONTACT-03 evaluated Cabometyx (cabozantinib) in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab) versus cabozantinib alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic clear cell or non-clear cell (papillary or unclassified only) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who progressed during or after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (either combination or monotherapy). RCC is a type of kidney cancer, and Cabometyx (cabozantinib) is approved for advanced RCC and previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients were randomized 1:1 between the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of cabozantinib alone. The CONTACT-03 study did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). Exelixis has collaborated with Roche to evaluate the combination of cabozantnib and Tecentriq, broadening its exploration of cabozantnib combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Tecentriq is an ICI.Protagonist Gains on Study Results: Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. PTGX surged after the company announced positive top-line results from FRONTIER 1 study of the oral IL-23 receptor antagonist JNJ-2113 (formerly PN-235) in psoriasis in collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson.  The randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study FRONTIER 1 phase IIb trial (NCT05223868) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of JNJ-2113 in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. It evaluated three once-daily dosages and two twice-daily dosages of JNJ-2113 taken orally.The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients achieving PASI-75 at 16 weeks. Data from the study showed that JNJ-2113 achieved the study's primary efficacy endpoint with a statistically significant greater proportion of patients who received JNJ-2113 achieving PASI-75 (a 75% improvement in skin lesions as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) responses compared to placebo at week 16 in all five treatment groups.Story continuesProtagonist expects that JNJ-2113 will progress into a phase III registrational study in plaque psoriasis on the strength of these data. If JNJ-2113 advances into a phase III study and the study meets its primary goal, Protagonist is entitled to get milestone payments of $50 million and $115 million, respectively. In total, Protagonist remains eligible for up to $855 million in various milestone payments and tiered royalties based on worldwide net drug sales.BridgeBio Soars on Dwarfism Study Data: Shares of commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. BBIO jumped after it announced positive results from PROPEL2, a mi-stage study evaluating infigratinib in children with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. Study results showed that in the highest dose level (cohort 5, 0.25 mg/kg once daily), the mean change from baseline in annualized height velocity (AHV) at six months was +3.03 cm/year for the first 10 children with at least six months of follow-up in cohort 5. The two remaining children who have not yet had six months of follow-up have a mean change from baseline in AHV of +8.8 cm/year based on three months' data.Of the children, 80% at six months were responders, as defined by an increase from baseline AHV of at least 25%. The mean change from baseline in AHV of responders was 3.81 cm/year. As a result of treatment, the median absolute AHV reached 7.6 cm/year, which is beyond the 99th percentile of growth for children living with achondroplasia. Infigratinib demonstrated clear dose-responsiveness as a single daily oral therapy and was well-tolerated with no adverse events assessed as treatment-related in cohort 5.  Based on the positive phase II results, BridgeBio has started to enroll children for a pivotal phase III study.  BridgeBio expects to initiate the development of infigratinib for hypochondroplasia, a skeletal dysplasia closely related to achondroplasia.Updates From BioMarin:  BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. BMRN announced that the FDA has accepted the company's supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Voxzogo (vosoritide) for injection to expand treatment in the United States to include children with achondroplasia under the age of 5.  The FDA has set a target action date of Oct 21, 2023.The company also announced that it has received a notice from the regulatory body informing it that the agency has extended the review of the company's biologics license application (BLA) for Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) gene therapy for adults with severe hemophilia A. The final decision from the regulatory agency is now expected by the end of June 2023. This extension period was due to the submission of three-year follow-up safety and efficacy data from the late-stage GENEr8-1 study supporting the BLA filing for Roctavian, which the FDA deemed as a major amendment to the earlier filed data.BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Setback For Incyte: Incyte INCY announced that it will discontinue the late-stage LIMBER-304 study following the results of a pre-planned interim analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). LIMBER-304 is a randomized, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of parsaclisib plus Jakafi (ruxolitinib) versus placebo plus ruxolitinib in adult (age ≥18 years) patients living with myelofibrosis (MF) who have an inadequate response to ruxolitinib monotherapy.The IDMC advised that the study is unlikely to meet its primary endpoint and hence Incyte decided to discontinue the study. The primary endpoint of LIMBER-304 was the proportion of patients who achieved a targeted reduction in spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has lost 1.77% in the past five trading sessions. Among the biotech giants, Incyte has lost 5.19% during the period. Over the past six months, shares of Biogen have soared 26.46%.

349,7fa2e66c-da0d-3f1d-8e70-feec71b2650b,INTU,2023-03-10,13 Best Software Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-software-stocks-invest-141835980.html,1678371515,STORY,"['MSFT', 'WDAY', 'ORCL', 'SNOW', 'COUP', 'VMW', 'INTU', 'GOOGL']","[In this  piece, we will take a look at the 13 best software stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. For more stocks, head on over the 5 Best Software Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds. Software is to hardware what the hand is to the glove. Both are dependent on each other for functioning, and even the smallest of chips with billions of transistors squeezed into an area of a penny are useless without the necessary software to power them up. Similarly, even the most advanced software is worthless unless there is adequate hardware power present to enable it to achieve all of its functions.Additionally, it's software and not the hardware that is responsible for powering some of the most important technologies today. The sharpest example of this is ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence powered chatbot that has taken the internet and the venture capital world by storm is run on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s graphics processing units (GPUs).In terms of financial value, the software industry is different from the hardware sector. While hardware companies are able to enjoy the luxury of setting high prices, they also see most of the revenue earned through these absorbed by the costs of manufacturing the products themselves. In fact, for semiconductor manufacturers such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), a gross margin of 50% is often thought to be a commendable achievement. In layman's terms, gross margin refers to the dollar value of sales that the company is left with after the direct costs of making its products are removed. Compare this to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s gross profit of $139 billion over its net sales of $204 for last year, which translates into a comfortable margin of 68%.However, even though they are able to earn more pennies on the dollar, software companies are constrained to compete in a smaller overall revenue pie since the price of their products remains lower. For instance, take a look at a research report from The Business Research Company which analyzed the computer hardware market. The research firm attributes a $658 billion value to this sector in 2022 and expects it to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% this year to sit at $705 billion. Looking further, it believes that the sector will grow at a 6.6% CAGR until 2027 to be worth $909 billion.Story continuesAnother report from the same firm looks only at the operating system market to determine that it will be worth $45 billion by the end of 2023 and grow at a CAGR of 1.7% to sit at $49 billion by 2027 end. While not strictly an apples to apples comparison, especially since many computer hardware products go inside one unit of a product that uses one unit of an operating system, it still shows the vast difference between the two highly interdependent technology sectors when it comes to valuation. However, still, if we were to remove this constraint, and consider the entire software market (an assumption that bloats its value since a single computer has tons of different software running on it), then according to The Business Research Company, the software market will be worth a whopping $2.4 trillion by 2027 end after growing at a 12% CAGR from 2023 onward.Today, we'll look at some software companies that are hedge fund favorites, with the top picks being Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc.

The introduction of Net Worth brings the company one step closer to becoming a full-service personal finance management platform, with products and features to help every American make progress, no matter where they are on their financial journey. Net Worth is being rolled out to U.S. consumers with a credit score of 720 or above, with the goal to expand to a larger population over time.WHY NET WORTH?Credit Karma has played an instrumental role in helping its members make financial progress by helping them overcome common financial hurdles like paying down debt, building credit or opening their first checking and savings account. Credit Karma recognizes no individual’s financial situation is the same and, as Americans graduate from one phase of their financial journey to the next, they’re met with a new set of financial challenges and are looking to build on the financial success they’ve achieved. These members likely have good credit and the ability to save money each month, yet still lack the confidence to maximize their money and plan for the future. Net Worth will put a person's full financial picture into perspective so members can feel confident in making decisions to grow their money.BUILDING ON MINT’S SUCCESSTo bring this to life, Intuit’s Mint business has joined the Credit Karma team to build its Net Worth experience, combining Mint’s more than 15 years of product experience helping consumers effectively manage their money. This marks the latest milestone in Credit Karma’s journey of championing financial progress for all, and serves as yet another example of how Intuit is accelerating Credit Karma’s ability to deliver greater value to members, as well as those who are not yet on the Credit Karma platform.Story continues""Credit Karma’s mission is to champion financial progress for all, but we know that financial progress looks different for everyone,"" said Kenneth Lin, CEO and founder of Credit Karma. ""This next evolution of Credit Karma will combine the expertise and momentum generated by Mint with Credit Karma’s scale and technology, and enable us to help more Americans, in particular those who are faced with a new set of financial challenges and are looking to elevate and protect their net worth.""KNOW YOUR NET WORTHCredit Karma’s Net Worth experience will transform over time to guide members on their path to elevate and protect their wealth, whether it be helping them maximize their credit card rewards based on their spending habits or sharing investment insights to help them diversify their portfolio. However, the first iteration will focus primarily on helping members understand the components of their net worth so they can monitor and track their progress over time, and make plans for their next dollar.""Net Worth was built for U.S. consumers who have already made significant progress on their credit score and are looking for that next financial health indicator to track and take action on, as they continue their financial journey,"" said Ryan Steckler, general manager of Prime and Mint.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at DaVita (NYSE:DVA), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for DaVita, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.092 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$17b - US$2.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, DaVita has an ROCE of 9.2%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 9.6% average generated by the Healthcare industry. View our latest analysis for DaVita roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for DaVita compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering DaVita here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThings have been pretty stable at DaVita, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So don't be surprised if DaVita doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.Our Take On DaVita's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to DaVita's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 9.3% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesDaVita does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning...If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

353,80942633-9c99-3369-94ba-f1ee0b1c6e47,IR,2023-03-10,Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ingersoll-rand-inc-nyse-ir-110520553.html,1678446320,STORY,['TT'],"[Ingersoll Rand's (NYSE:IR) stock is up by 9.2% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Ingersoll Rand's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ingersoll Rand is:6.4% = US$593m ÷ US$9.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Ingersoll Rand's Earnings Growth And 6.4% ROEAt first glance, Ingersoll Rand's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 13%. In spite of this, Ingersoll Rand was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 29% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Ingersoll Rand's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 7.8% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is IR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Ingersoll Rand Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Ingersoll Rand's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 4.6%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 95% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.While Ingersoll Rand has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 3.6% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 11%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, it does look like Ingersoll Rand has some positive aspects to its business. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Investors fled the sector after tech-industry lender SVB Financial Group launched a share sale to shore up its balance sheet due to declining deposits from startups struggling for funding.The Nasadaq ended down more than 2% while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 and the Dow lost close to 2%.Investors were also stressing out before Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report for February with expectations for large wage increases fueling inflation worries. Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week exacerbated concerns about upcoming interest rate hikes aimed at fighting stubbornly high inflation.Traders were betting that chances of a 50-basis-point rate hike at the Fed's March meeting were around 60%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, up sharply from a probability of 31% before Powell's Tuesday and Wednesday appearances in Congress.""There's a lot of anticipation around tomorrow's jobs report. We're going to get a slew of data in the next week and a half,"" said Mona Mahajan, Senior Investment Strategist, Edward Jones, New York, also citing inflation and retail sales reports all due out before the next Fed meeting which ends March 22.Earlier on Thursday, Labor Department data showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 4, compared with economist forecasts for 195,000 claims.Story continuesWhile last week's increased jobless claims may be ""the first sign the labor market may be showing signs of loosening,"" Mahajan wants to see ""more data points to establish a trend.""The February non-farm payrolls report is expected to show a payrolls increase of 205,000 after January's blowout 517,000 figure, which had already led markets to brace for a bigger U.S. rate hike.Any proof last month's ""gigantic payrolls number wasn't an anomaly"" would serve to ""reinforce the market's anxieties around the Fed's response to it,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.And with February wage increases expected to rise 4.7% compared with January's 4.4%, ""it feels like its ticking in the wrong direction even if we just meet expectations,"" said Mahajan who will be closely watching the wage data.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 543.54 points, or 1.66%, to 32,254.86, the S&amp;P 500 lost 73.69 points, or 1.85%, to 3,918.32 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 237.65 points, or 2.05%, to 11,338.36.The biggest drag on the S&amp;P 500 came from the financial sector followed by information technology.The financials index ended the day down 4%, its deepest one-day percentage loss since June 2020. The S&amp;P bank sub-sector turned negative for the year-to-date on Thursday, last down 4.7% so far for 2023. Thursday was its first full day trading below its 200-day moving average since Jan. 5.All the S&amp;P's 11 major industry sectors ended the session lower. Utilities, down 0.8% was the smallest decliner. Consumer staples was the next smallest, down 0.95%, with healthcare down 1%.With investors already concerned that the Fed could over-tighten and cause a recession and hurt bank lending demand, ""there's an element of 'sell-first ask questions later' with regard to contagion risk,"" from SVB Financial for banks said Luschini at Janney Montgomery Scott.SVB closed down 60% at $106.04 after falling at one point by around 63% and hitting its lowest level since August 2016 after the lender slashed its 2023 outlook and launched a share sale to shore up its balance sheet.Also weighing on the sub-index was Signature Bank, which tumbled 12% to $90.76 after its crypto-bank peer Silvergate Capital Corp disclosed plans to voluntarily liquidate. Silvergate closed down 42% to $2.84.On the bright side, General Electric Co closed up more than 5% after the industrial conglomerate reiterated its 2023 earnings forecast.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.83-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 22 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 289 new lows.On U.S exchanges 11.69 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.95 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

With a market capitalization of $84.1 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was about 2.3 million.A compelling portfolio, leadership position, strength in Vehicle and Property businesses, healthy policies in force, retention and solid capital position continue to drive this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer.Will the Bull Run Continue?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Progressive’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.66 per share, indicating an increase of 64% on 13.6% higher revenues of $58.5 billion.

The long-term earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 23.6%, better than the industry average of 14.5%.Progressive is the largest seller of motorcycle and boat policies, a market leader in commercial auto insurance and one of the top 15 homeowner carriers based on premiums written. PGR’s net premiums written increased 11% in the last 10 years and surpassed the industry average of 4%. Banking on a compelling product portfolio, leadership position, healthy policies in force, better pricing and a solid retention ratio, the insurer is poised to retain the growth momentum.Policy life expectancy, a measure of customer retention, has improved in the last few years across all business lines. Strategic initiatives to provide consumers with a distinctive new auto insurance option along with competitive pricing should help Progressive retain its momentum. The insurer thus has been focusing on cross-selling homes with auto insurance.Banking on prudent underwriting, PGR’s combined ratio averaged less than 93% in a decade and compared favorably with the industry average combined ratio of more than 100%. Though combined ratio deteriorated in 2022, prudent underwriting, favorable reserve development should help improve the metric.In tandem with the industry, PGR continues to heavily invest in technology. It estimates accelerated digitalization to improve non-acquisition ratio in 2023.The company’s operational excellence supports a solid capital position that enhances shareholders’ value.

FlemingThank you, Joanne. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to report the results for the fourth quarter and year end in 2022, and there are many highlights worth mentioning. In short, 2022 was another incredible year for Global Water as we continue to advance our mission of growing and aggregating water and wastewater utilities so that our customers can realize the benefits of consolidation, regionalization and environmental stewardship in the face of water scarcity, challenging regulations and aging infrastructure.For the year, total active service connections increased 4.4% to 56,270 at December 31, 2022, up from 53,882 at December 31, 2021. When combining service connection growth with the completion of our company rate case earlier in the year, which included new rates for 96% of our customers, revenues increased 6.7% to $44.7 million for the full year. We also continue to design and engineering work for the e Inland Port Arizona mega-site where Global Water will be working with Procter &amp; Gamble to provide water, wastewater and recycled water services to P&amp;G's new manufacturing facility, which is adjacent to the Nikola Motor Corp. facility. We invested $8.7 million in CapEx investment in the quarter in existing utilities to provide safe, reliable service, and focused on increasing revenues, reducing expenses and building rate base.We also began providing bulk water service to Seven Ranches Domestic Water District in Maricopa, Arizona, at the request of the city and their local district board.From an acquisition perspective, earlier in the year, we continued to expand our footprint with 2 smaller tuck-in water utility acquisitions in Pima County, an area that continues to build momentum. Within Pima County, subsequent to quarter close, in February 2023, the company completed the acquisition of Farmers Water Company. The acquisition added a total of 3,300 active water service connections and approximately 21.5 square miles of Certificate of Convenience and Necessity service area in the Town of Sahuarita and the surrounding unincorporated area of Pima County. These acquisitions have increased Global Water's total active water service connections in Pima County to nearly 5,000. And finally, with safety and compliance being our top mandate, we are very proud of our ongoing safety and compliance records. For the year, we had 0 significant compliance events and no preventable OSHA reportable events. In fact, this means we have now surpassed 6 years without a significant compliance event and have now gone over 980 days since our last preventable OSHA reportable event.I want to pause, highlight and thank the team here at Global Water, whose exceptional performance allows me to provide such wonderful updates for our company.Now I want to discuss organic customer growth and what is going on in our core utilities. Despite the local and national slowdown, development and housing activity does continue in metro Phoenix and our service areas. In 2022, metro Phoenix did experience a 23% reduction in single-family home building permits over the same period of 2021. But this is still nearly 25,000 single-family building permits. In Maricopa, our largest utilities, where we're also seeing a slowdown, the city still issued 1,157 permits in 2022. With that said on housing, the booming economy and net immigration that Arizona continues to realize requires more and more places for people to live, work and play. That is why large-scale multifamily housing, commercial and recreational projects continue to accelerate at an extremely high pace in metro Phoenix, and this continues to push out to our areas, either in our existing service territories or in communities immediately adjacent.Additionally, the industrial manufacturing boom also continues, with 2022 being the single best year for Arizona all time from an industrial economic development investment perspective. This seems to be continuing into 2023. Because of this, we continue to make excellent progress on the engineering, permitting and construction of new service areas, including for the Inland Port Arizona, our Nikola Motor Cprp. facility is being expanded and where Procter &amp; Gamble acquired land. Based on all of these trends, we believe that in the years to come, we will continue to see considerable large-scale commercial multifamily housing and industrial growth in addition to the return of strong organic housing growth. Putting all these elements together, Global Water remains well positioned.I will now turn the call over to Mike for financial highlights.Michael J. LiebmanThanks, Ron. Hello, everyone. Total revenue for the year was $44.7 million, which was up $2.8 million or 6.7% compared to 2021. This increase is primarily driven by the 4.4% increase in active service connections, the acquisition of Las Quintas Serenas in Q4 of 2021, combined with the new rates that were implemented in August of 2022. These increases were offset by the $692,000 in revenue recognized in Q3 of 2021 related to our infrastructure, coordination and financing agreements, also known as ICFAs, as we didn't recognize any ICFA revenue in 2022. A more fulsome explanation of ICFAs can be found in our annual filings.Regulated revenue, which excludes ICFA revenue for 2022, increased $3.5 million or 8.6% compared to 2021. Again, this increase was driven by the increase in active service connections, combined with new rates and the acquisition of Las Quintas Serenas.Operating expenses for 2022 were $36.8 million (sic) [$36.9 million] compared to $34.9 million in 2021. This is an increase of $1.9 million or 5.3% (sic) [$2.0 million or 5.7%].Notable changes in operating expenses included increased operating and maintenance costs by $590,000, which was primarily associated with the acquisition of Las Quintas Serenas combined with increased expenses as the company continues to grow and manage inflation.G&amp;A expense increased by $880,000, primarily driven by $600,000 higher professional fees, primarily tied to acquisition and rate case matters, the write-off of $314,000 in rate case expenses as a result of the improved rate case and higher IT contract services and rent expense. These were offset by lower deferred comp and board expense due to the reduction in stock price.Lastly, we had $400,000 increase in depreciation and amortization tied to our capital expenditure program and the acquisition of Las Quintas Serenas. Now to discuss other expense. Other expense for 2022 was $1.4 million compared to $2.2 million in 2021. This $836,000 decrease was primarily due to the $1.1 million increase in the Buckeye growth premium and higher capitalized interest. These were offset by the $1.4 million sale of cell tower leases in 2021.Turning to net income. Global Water had net income of $5.6 million (sic) [$5.5 million] in 2022. This was a 52.6% increase compared to 2021, and equated to $0.24 per diluted share.Now to talk about adjusted EBITDA, which adjusts for nonrecurring items such as ICFA revenue, as well as noncash items such as restricted stock expense. Adjusted EBITDA was $22.1 million in 2022, an increase of $3.4 million or 18.3% compared to 2021.I'd like to briefly touch on inflation. While we have been able to manage expenses in 2022 quite well, given the inflation situation, we do expect to see some increases in future periods, primarily related to personnel costs. Additionally, as you would expect, we have experienced an increase in capital costs as a direct result of inflation.Lastly, before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to remind folks that the second phasing of our new rates began in January of 2023. And with this, over 95% of our rate increases will be embedded in our 2023 financial statements. This represents $2.1 million of the approved $2.2 million in new rates based on the 2019 test year.This concludes our update on the year-end 2022 financial results. I will now pass the call to Chris.Christopher D. KrygierThanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. As you may have seen in our press release, and heard Ron mentioned earlier, we closed the Farmers' acquisition on February 1, 2023. This acquisition is a culmination of a significant amount of work to bring the deal to fruition, and something we are very proud of. We are now focused on integrating the company into our professional utility platform and the process is continuing as expected. This acquisition brings significant benefits to our company. First, it adds over 3,300 active water connections to our family of companies. This represents over 5% to our active connection count at the end of 2022. Second, it adds over 21 square miles of service territory that will eventually convert from the corn farming into primarily residential homes. This 21 square miles represents an additional 5% to the number of square miles of service area.At full build-out, the service area could reach approximately 20,000 customers. Third, Farmers' customers will benefit from our Total Water Management approach, including our expertise in technology, automation and other internal operations.Finally, when combined with our Las Quintas Serenas acquisition in 2021, the utility that is adjacent to Farmers, we now have additional scale to make further capital investments and recover costs from customers in the future. We are pleased this deal came together and believe it will provide long-term customer and shareholder benefits.Briefly turning to acquisitions more broadly. We continue to focus our efforts on finding opportunities that complement our existing portfolio and are in various stages of discussions with potential prospects.This concludes the update on growth activity and strategic initiatives in the quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Ron.Ron L. FlemingThank you, Chris. It is clear, despite the challenges of the last few years, we remain well positioned from an operational and financial perspective, and can continue to be great utility partners for the communities where we have the privilege to serve. We will pursue expansion through organic growth, acquisitions and new projects, both big and small. We intend to remain at the forefront of the water management industry, and advance our mission of achieving efficiency and consolidation.We truly believe that expanding our Total Water Management platform and applying our expertise throughout our regional service areas and to new utilities will benefit all stakeholders involved. We appreciate your investment in and support of us as we continue to grow Global Water to address important utility, water resource and economic development issues in Arizona and potentially beyond.These highlights conclude our prepared remarks. Thank you. We are now available to answer questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Gerry Sweeney of ROTH Capital.Gerard J. SweeneyA question on -- so -- on Maricopa. Historically, I've tracked single-family permits because I thought that was a great sort of metric to watch in terms of watching growth in the area. But obviously, that market is slowing, but affordability is a big -- a big draw to Arizona. You have the Procter &amp; Gamble plant going in, you have semiconductor plant coming in, and it also sounds like you have multifamily opportunity starting to rise. How do we look at that in terms of growth? And how does that impact the income statement? Multifamily are different from single-family, should we look at not only single-family permits, but also watch total population growth in the area because that's going to -- there's going to be different ways of tracking it?Maybe some suggestions, ideas of where you see growth going, and how it's going to develop and sort of change in the short to medium term?Michael J. LiebmanYes. Gerry, this is Mike. I'm happy to take that one. So you are right. Obviously, the homebuilding has slowed a little bit, although, over the medium and long term, we expect that to pick back up again. But on the multifamily, we're starting to see some activity there. And so latest and greatest intelligence that we have, there's only -- we only currently have 2 multifamily projects, but they're slated in 2023 7 projects and there's an additional 7 to 9 projects that are slated 18 to 36 months out. So there's quite a bit of activity there that could ultimately result in -- the 2023 projects, we leased closer to 1,500 units and in the -- more fulsome is closer to 4,000 units with this stuff 18 to 36 months out. So I'll tell you is that, that's not a one-for-one on a single-family home. And so you can't necessarily draw each unit as a new home. There will be substantial revenue associated with these multifamily units coming in.And then, as a reminder, on the single-family home side, while we do believe in the medium and long term, there is a lot of growth from the industrial -- and businesses that are coming to Arizona, the affordability factor that you mentioned, City of Maricopa is trading at north of (inaudible) discount to the Greater Phoenix. And so we feel like we're pleased to -- in a great position to take advantage of folks who are looking to purchase homes.Gerard J. SweeneyGot it. And then speaking of that medium and long term, I know even for Procter &amp; Gamble. How -- I look at this as sort of the foundational stage for that project. Could you give a little bit of maybe view to how that develops over the next 1, 3, 5 years, and how we should think about it? Obviously, I don't think it's a short-term impact on earnings, but I do think it is, like I said, a foundational opportunity that adds runway to the growth story down there.Ron L. FlemingYes. Gerry, this is Ron. I'll go ahead and take that one. I think that's a great way to say it's really just the foundational element of what is to come is really just get and going. Obviously, we started up service to Nikola on kind of a smaller scale last year, and then now we've announced the -- at least land acquisition that Procter &amp; Gamble made immediately adjacent to Nikola's part of this Inland Port mega site. But -- so first, I'll speak just to that, and then I'll step back and talk a little bit more broadly. Yes. So Procter &amp; Gamble, they're obviously a well-planned organization. And so they're ahead of the game from what we typically see from a build time perspective. But what they're currently telling us or at least have announced publicly as well is that they're shooting for a mid-2025 to late 2025 opening date for their project. So that's just over 2 years out. So for the work that we do, that still means that, that starts almost immediately, but from a financial results perspective, that's further down the road.Once you put Procter &amp; Gamble and Nikola together, which I think the 2 transactions, at least what was announced, is a total of 700 acres. What we're currently working with them on really is potentially not still build-out of those 700 acres because, ultimately, you can put lots of plants and facilities in the size of properties that they bought. And so it's up to them to announce and talk about what they may do on the properties later. But for now, we're working with them on their current phases to meet that time line. But stepping back from the properties they acquired, there is a total of about 17, 18 parcels inside of this Inland Port Arizona. P&amp;G actually took down 2 of them. Nikola took 1 of the bigger ones, but it's over like 2,300 acres and so there's still over a dozen parcels still to go.And because of the activity of those 2, or really the activity around the entire site has picked up. And I'll just say that we answer the early, what they call, project information forms, which people are looking to potentially select one of those parcels located in the Inland Port, we're dealing with those on a weekly basis.Now we can't speak to who's going to select the property, and what they're going to build and when. But the belief is that now that there's that foundation, as you referred to it, yes, it's just the beginning and that Inland Port will actually fill up pretty well in the years and decades to come. The evidence of this is the same developer that's doing Inland Port actually did this first in the City of Casa Grande just 20 minutes away from where we're at in Coolidge. And he started that project with Lucid, where we should be familiar with their electric vehicle manufacturing facility, and then the new southwest regional -- or main facility for a tractor supply company. And since that -- beginning those 2, the whole part there is filled out, is out of land there, thus his full attention is here on Coolidge, and we just think that's evidence of how he does it and what is to come.OperatorAll right. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to now turn the call back over to Mr. Fleming. Sir, please go ahead.Ron L. FlemingYes. Thank you, operator. I'd like to thank everybody for participating on the call today and for your ongoing interest in Global Water Resources. I appreciate it, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a great rest of your day.]"

However, it illustrates the leverage enjoyed by the best-paid workers in the airline industry. Airlines have struggled with pilot shortages since they encouraged thousands to take early retirement when travel collapsed early in the pandemic.The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline thought it had a deal with pilots in November, but the union's board rejected a tentative agreement that would have raised pay by nearly 20% after two years.Delta pilots, who are represented by a different union, ratified a contract last week that will boost pay a cumulative 34% over four years. They also enjoy better profit-sharing benefits than pilots at other airlines.The Delta deal was stunning — Isom called it “unprecedented in the history of collective bargaining.” It put immediate pressure on American, United and Southwest, which are still in negotiations with their pilots, to match Delta's terms.In a video that American sent to pilots on Tuesday, Isom pledged that pilots and other employees “will be paid well, and they will be paid competitively.”Story continuesIsom offered pilots pay raises averaging 21% in the first year of a new contract and a new profit-sharing plan and higher 401(k) retirement contributions in the second year. The combination of higher pay and contributions would lead to the top-scale compensation figures he gave of $475,000 and $590,000 a year.He said the proposed pay deal would cost American $7 billion over four years.The CEO also promised to improve the airline's crew-scheduling practices, which are a subject of much complaining among pilots.Sarah Jantz, a spokeswoman for American, said the airline believes that ""a deal is within reach and can be negotiated expeditiously.”]"

We're making meaningful progress toward this goal:Principal provides capital to fuel growth for women-owned businesses as a First Women's Bank Mission Partner.In Singapore, Aidha, a Principal® Foundation grantee, provides financial education and skill-building to migrant domestic workers and lower-income women.With support from Principal Foundation, FreeFrom builds an ecosystem of support to intimate partner violence survivors. By providing basic needs, access to capital, and professional skill-building through Gifted, their social enterprise, FreeFrom removes financial security barriers unique to survivors.Principal also helps customers improve financial wellness through useful products and resources, personalized information, and tailored education-including webinars specific to women's financial challenges and goals.Story continues""If the problems are varied and systemic, the chasm can feel unbridgeable,"" says Jo Christine Miles, director of community relations and Principal® Foundation. ""But it's not. Policy changes, combined with focused, innovative, capacity-building programs, and expanded access to capital could help more women-owned small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs thrive.""Fostering a deep sense of belonging among women in the workplaceDriving change, of course, starts with core values and aligning employer practices.In 2022, we conducted a global pay equity study with a third party focused on race and gender. The results: Our management of pay equity ranks best in class among financial services companies reporting pay equity data. We also require all leaders to take unconscious bias training and apply their learnings in everyday decision-making.Additionally, this is our third year on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), which measures companies on key factors including leadership and talent pipeline, equal pay and gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and external brand. Of the 153 financial companies evaluated for their work in 2022, we scored higher in seven out of eight categories.""These are just a few examples of how we've continued to reinforce a culture of inclusion at Principal,"" says Miriam Lewis, chief inclusion officer for Principal. ""It's feeling you can be your authentic self while at work. When you have that, you have the license to bring your ideas to the table and can focus on the business itself-because you're not thinking about covering up. You're thinking about financial security for all.""That deep sense of belonging is something women at Principal can tap further into as part of the Global Women's employee resource group (ERG)-providing opportunities to connect, develop, empower, and support one another across departments and countries. This newly launched group brings together existing women-focused initiatives and groups under one umbrella to provide greater, unified support and development for women at Principal. The Global Women's ERG kicked off in 2023 through a virtual event in celebration of International Women's Day, March 8.Empowering more women at PrincipalWomen make up 54% of our global workforce and 46% of our leadership.4And when employees need more specific support, they can also access one of six niche women's networks which are supported through the Global Women's ERG such as Women in Technology, Women in Sales, and EnablHER (Women in India).Women in LatAm, one of the newest networks, focuses on developing women employees in Latin America while providing tools and resources to promote a more inclusive culture. Since their inception in 2021, they've increased the number of job vacancies filled by women by 6% and the percentage of women in executive leadership positions from 36% to 38%.""Bias, attitudes, and beliefs are the main barriers to female professional development,"" says Marcela Blaquier, LatAm Strategy and Project Manager for Principal who co-leads the group. ""Raising awareness about shared behaviors is a necessary first step toward making change.""Ultimately, our global practice of including women in everything we do is helping us reach our highest potential as a company.""That's how we get the best out of every employee,"" Lewis says.

The upgrade mainly integrates mental health coverage within the product.The benefits stemming from the enriched product tend to cover expenses related to hospital confinements arising from a wide array of common mental health conditions which are not covered under health insurance. To name a few, the mental health conditions encompass schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and eating disorders.To ease availing the hospital confinement benefit, the least number of hours that a patient needs to stay in a hospital has been reduced to 18 hours from the prior mark of 23 hours.Aflac Choice Hospital Insurance assures policyholders to not undergo any rate increases from the expanded coverage. Additionally, the upgraded product contains optional riders so that policyholders can boost income protection coverage.With varied benefits wrapped within a single product, policyholders can customize their coverage per distinctive individual needs and budgets. The expanded insurance coverage aims to shield the income of a policyholder, which otherwise needs to be significantly dispensed in case of unanticipated medical bills arising from a mental health disease.The latest product enrichment reflects Aflac’s continuous efforts to impart physical, financial and mental well-being to its policyholders. The same is also likely to expand the suite of AFL’s offerings in the mental health space.Last year, Aflac included mental health coverage within its Individual Short-Term Disability insurance product. Also, it collaborated with the digital health platform NeuroFlow in 2022 to integrate a mental health solution into its Group Long-Term Disability offering.The importance of integrating mental health coverage within its offerings seems to be aptly timed on the part of Aflac since Americans have been grappling with rising mental health issues for quite some time. The COVID-19 pandemic and escalating healthcare costs nationwide further worsened the scenario, necessitating the need for accessible and affordable mental health coverage. Story continuesPer the National Alliance on Mental Illness, mental illness and substance use disorders account for 1 in every 8 emergency department visits made by a U.S. adult. Also, 24.7% of adults grappling with a mental health condition could not avail treatment due to inadequate funds, per Mental Health America.Shares of Aflac have gained 10.3% in a year compared with the industry’s 14.2% growth.

(PEP) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-pep-attracting-investor-140002275.html,1678370402,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this food and beverage company have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has gained 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share, indicating a change of +6.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.23 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.81 indicates a change of +8% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.18 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $89.48 billion and $93.97 billion estimates indicate +3.6% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. EPS of $1.67 for the same period compares with $1.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.27%. The EPS surprise was +1.83%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.94 billion, down 0.93% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $41 per share and revenue of $12.48 billion, which would represent changes of -8.85% and +2.54%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Regeneron. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 18.16, which means Regeneron is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesInvestors should also note that REGN has a PEG ratio of 2.14 right now.

(Ameriprise Financial) (headquartered in Minneapolis, MN) [NYSE: AMP]. The outlook assigned to the Credit Rating (rating) is stable. All other ratings of Ameriprise Financial and its subsidiaries are unchanged.The proceeds from this debt issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchasing all of Ameriprise’s $750 million, 4.0% senior unsecured notes maturing in October 2023. The impact of this issuance on Ameriprise’s debt leverage is expected to increase temporarily over the near term as a higher leverage ratio will be realized prior to the note redemption before decreasing to the lower 30% range; AM Best expects the interest coverage with this debt issue to remain very favorable.Ameriprise’s liquidity position is strong, with the parent company holding highly liquid cash and cash equivalents of $6.9 billion at year-end 2022. The company’s full-year 2022 pre-tax adjusted operating income was $2.6 billion and net cash from operations was $4.4 billion. In Ameriprise’s most recent disclosure, a primary driver of the results was attributed its advice and wealth Management segment, in which it reported reaching a new margin high of 30%; other business segments have also done well. The company’s retirement services segment increased 25% year-over-year to reach $229 million, driven by higher investment income and lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs offset by lower sales levels.This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Dig deep into the results and the signs of a retailer growing irrelevant — and management realizing just that — aren't hard to find.Ending inventory plunged 21% from the prior year as the company pushed through deep sales to clear excess inventory, notably at the once-hot Old Navy division (where sales fell 6% in the quarter).Ideally, in an economy that's still growing, a fundamentally solid retailer would be buying inventory to sell to human beings — not slashing and burning inventory in an attempt to raise cash (among other levers the CFO hopes to pull).At its current inventory levels, a trip to Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta this spring could be a quick one as your sizes (or style preferences) may simply not be on the rack.Another reason why Gap looks like it's throwing in the towel: The company unveiled a new $300 million cost-cutting effort fueled in part by ""decreasing management layers.""In other words, Gap is canning more higher-ups that theoretically could be working to plot some form of epic turnaround. No management, no long-term strategic planning, no turnaround. Simple equation.'I guess no more growth or talent!'Gap says it has now identified $550 million in cost savings in the past six months. That may help to make an earnings number in the second half of this year, but it does nothing to set the company up for lasting success.The company also revealed that it sacked its Chief Growth Officer (CGO) Asheesh Saksena. Saksena joined Gap only two years ago after serving as an advisor to the CEO of Best Buy. The growth officer role at any company is often focused on —you guessed it — strategizing on how best to grow the organization in the near term, medium term and long term.Story continuesPeople walk past a Gap flagship store on July 2, 2021. The clothing company will close 81 stores in Britain and Ireland by September, but will continue to trade online. (Photo by Rob Pinney/Getty Images)Did we mention Gap also booted its Chief People Officer Sheila Peters? The chief people officer focuses on how best to manage the people in an organization and get the most out of them (by and large).Basically, Gap is actively eliminating roles that are supposed to assist in effectively running a thriving company.""I guess no more growth or talent!"" one long-time Gap watcher told Yahoo Finance via email.One Gap insider recently told Yahoo Finance that how the iconic retailer's apparent demise plays out will fall on the next CEO, who this person said is ""close"" to being hired — some eight months after the firing of CEO Sonia Syngal. That inability to secure a new CEO speaks volumes to where Gap is today.Gap, for its part, has a different take on these people moves.""We believe our best opportunities for growth are in our brands and through our strategic partnerships, including the various market partnerships we’ve entered over the past 18 months to amplify our brands internationally in a more asset light way,"" Gap spokesperson told Yahoo Finance by email. ""At the same time, the changes we are making overall are designed to flatten the organization by increasing spans of control and decreasing layers to improve quality and speed of decision making. And the elimination of the CGO role is an example of that.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

This compares to loss of $0.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -27.12%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this clothing chain would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.71, delivering a surprise of 3,650%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Gap , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $4.24 billion for the quarter ended January 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.95%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.53 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Gap shares have added about 6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4%.What's Next for Gap?While Gap has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gap: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.18 on $3.48 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.64 on $15.87 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

We have Gap, Alta, DocuSign, and Oracle.Kicking off with Gap, and you can see a lot of red on your screen here. Gap off just about 6% following its miss on both the top and bottom lines. Wider-than-expected loss here for Gap.Also reported declining sales, more executive shakeups, and total comp sales declining about 5%. Certainly seeing a pullback in consumer spending in the face of higher prices.So we're looking at an extended loss of just about 6% over the last three months. Gap shares are off about 16% over the last year. The loss slightly worse, off just about 20%.Let's take a look at Ulta. That stock also under a bit of pressure here despite relatively strong results here. Just a slight miss. Price hikes helping Ulta here. Fourth-quarter comp sales jumping 15.6%, blowing away the Street's expectations. But margin and also unit growth, those forecasts just trailing the Street's estimates over the last year. You can certainly see Ulta far outperforming the broader market with gains of nearly 40%. We talk time and time again that people continue to spend on their makeup. They're not willing to give it up just yet.Let's take a look at DocuSign. That stock off just about 6% here in after-hours trading. Q1 billings forecast, that missed the Street's expectations. Revenue, though, for his most recent quarter actually beating the Street's expectations, $659.6 million. Also profit-adjusted EPS, $0.65. That was also a beat.CFO Cynthia Gaylor will be stepping down from her position, another executive shakeup. Over the last year-- we know DocuSign was a pandemic darling. Certainly has been under pressure here over the last year, off just about 34%.Wrapping up with Oracle. That stock off nearly 5% in extended trading. Take a look at some of these numbers. The company did increase its dividend, which is good news there for shareholders, by 25% to $0.40 a share, but 3Q sales just missed the Street's expectations, and doesn't look like the Street was impressed with its cloud revenue growth. It did rise 45% to $4.1 billion, but some slowing growth there obviously an issue for the Street.We're looking at extended losses of about 5%. Over the last year, though, Oracle staying in the green, up just about 14%, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, Seana, thank you. Good job.]"
