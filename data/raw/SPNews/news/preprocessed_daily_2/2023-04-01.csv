Let's take a closer look at some of the best and worst performers, starting with the S&amp;P 500. So as we're looking here, we've got Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, Warner Brothers, Discovery. I thought Nvidia was an interesting one.A lot of people looking at it as a real strong AI player especially. We saw from Stacey Rasgon at Bernstein, he reiterated his outperform rating, raised his price target forecast to $300 from $265. And this really is based on this need, this expected need, for these Nvidia chips to train the AI models that are going to be running this generative AI that's clearly in demand at the moment. And we saw that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced a wide-ranging set of partnerships for the products as well. So this really does seem like a long term play that Nvidia is really capitalizing on.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and a few things within the best performers. I mean, you also look at the environment that they're waiting through right now, whether that's on still the fundamentals, not really having clear sight going ahead. You don't know when the digital advertising market is going to resume the type of spending that we had seen in 2021 or even 2020 as everybody was spending more time on their devices and everybody wanted to get some of their attention and get some of the dollars that consumers were still willing to spend to whatever extent. So there's the digital advertising market. And even with that, there is still a buoy that companies like Facebook and Google could benefit from because they're typically seen as the two behemoths, the duopoly, that's been able to drive that narrative for so long.Story continuesHowever, that is getting a little bit more different because of the type of devices that end users have in their hands on a daily basis. All that considered, though, on how we go forward from here-- semiconductors, even the rebound there, you could really kind of sum it up in some of the worst performers of last year being some of the early year best performers here in 2023. And if you look at some of the worst performers as of right now, it's the names that should have beware-- or should have-- what is the adage? Beware the ides of March, right?Banking sector probably could have benefited from that because of the turmoil that we've seen take place there. Some of the biggest decliners there, you're seeing regional banks. First Republic, of course, the most outsized there. And that has been down by about 89%, but much of that move significantly coming, of course, during March given the fallout and given some of the different stressors that have impacted and the missteps that management has made within some of the regional banks there that have resulted in the injections of cash and capital that they've needed to take on just to stay or try to stay afloat right now, too.RACHELLE AKUFO: That's true. I mean, and speaking of some of these worst performers in the S&amp;P, you also have in their Dish Network, one of the few pure streaming plays still left. And they're really trying to find its place in this market. You have Amazon, Apple, all the other sort of getting into this space. Dish Network still searching for some direction there. And even as we look at some of the best performers in the NASDAQ 100, Nvidia again making another appearance, but also Meta, Tesla, you have CGen as well. A lot of people wondering what's going to be happening with Tesla. A lot of headlines obviously surrounding Elon Musk. But we saw what their production targets look like. And apparently investors do believe that Tesla is actually going to make those.BRAD SMITH: And so what does this all come back to as well? It still comes back to the Fed-- and I know we're going to talk about this more in a second-- but it comes back to the policy pathway and the tenor that this Fed has signaled. If they have this signal and given language to the markets that perhaps the worst of the rate hiking is behind us, and now we are getting to more of a stable period where the markets can anticipate what the Fed may do without having to fight the Fed, then you're going to see a continued rally in some of the very names that have really led the way thus far in 2023. Tech stocks, most importantly, because they were some of the most battered as the Fed was initiating the end of their easy money policies as well.RACHELLE AKUFO: I mean, you have to wonder when it comes to some of these tightening conditions for small businesses, where we're going to start seeing people pulling back. It might show up. I mean, maybe you won't-- again, going for that more expensive car, if you have to sort of tighten the purse strings. And Teslas aren't cheap. That's for sure.BRAD SMITH: I have to get a car first, Rachelle, thank you.RACHELLE AKUFO: That's all right.BRAD SMITH: That MTA subway pass works real well.]"

FNDA has been able to amass assets over $6.03 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, FNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index.The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for FNDA, making it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.54%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 20.60% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector; Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, First Solar Inc (FSLR) accounts for about 0.42% of total assets, followed by Geo Group Reit Inc (GEO) and Valmont Inds Inc (VMI).The top 10 holdings account for about 2.36% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF has added about 2.59% so far, and is down about -10.22% over the last 12 months (as of 03/31/2023). FNDA has traded between $42.52 and $53.81 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 1.20 and standard deviation of 26.50% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDA a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 976 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) tracks Russell 2000 Value Index and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) tracks CRSP U.S. Small Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $11.17 billion in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $23.87 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This technology is ideal for managing exponential data expansion and data-centric applications, such as smartphones, IoT devices and data centers.The new 3D flash memory technology is the eighth-generation BiCS FLASH, which reportedly has the industry's highest bit density owing to its 218-layer 3D flash that leverages 1Tb triple-level-cell and quad-level-cell with four planes, highlighted Kioxia. This has helped the company to improve bit density by more than 50%, per a company report.Additionally, it has a high-speed NAND I/O that operates at over 3.2Gb/s, up 60% over the prior generation. According to the company, it also offers a 20% improvement in write performance and read latency, speeding up overall performance and usability for consumers.Western Digital Corporation Price and ConsensusWestern Digital Corporation Price and ConsensusWestern Digital Corporation price-consensus-chart | Western Digital Corporation QuoteKioxia has already started shipping samples to limited customers. The successful engineering partnership between the two companies has resulted in significant advancements in 3D flash memory technologies.The companies have continuously collaborated to decrease costs while enabling ongoing lateral scaling developments. The businesses designed the CBA (CMOS directly Bonded to Array) technology, which involves manufacturing each CMOS wafer and cell array wafer independently in its optimal state before bonding them together to produce increased bit density and quick NAND I/O speed, added the company.In January, both companies engaged in advanced talks for a probable merger, reported Bloomberg. However, there was no official comment on the matter from either of the parties. As part of the deal, Western Digital is likely to spin off its flash unit and integrate it with Kioxia to create a new publicly trading company in the United States. This will be followed by a second listing in Japan. Story continuesThe combined company would then have a major share of the global NAND flash market. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the NAND flash memory market is expected to reach $94.24 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 5.33% from 2022 to 2027.Last year, the two companies had inked an agreement for jointly investing in the first phase of the Fab7 (Y7) manufacturing facility at Kioxia's state-of-the-art Yokkaichi Plant in the Mie Prefecture of Japan.Western Digital is one of the leading hard disk drive producers globally, which are used in desktop PCs, servers, network-attached storage devices, video game consoles, etc.The company’s performance is affected by weakening consumer demand owing to prevailing global macroeconomic uncertainties and rising inflation. Also, the company expects enterprise solid-state drive product demand to be affected as large cloud customers have entered the ""digestion period.""At present, WDC carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. United States Steel (X) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 27, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.46 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.46 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.39 Zacks Consensus Estimate, United States Steel has an Earnings ESP of 16.17%.X is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Nucor (NUE).Nucor is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 20, 2023. NUE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.03 a share 20 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nucor is $3.90, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.25%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, X and NUE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Acuity Brands (AYI), which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Lighting industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This lighting maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 15.29%.For the last reported quarter, Acuity Brands came out with earnings of $3.29 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 per share, representing a surprise of 12.67%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.35 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.95 per share, delivering a surprise of 17.91%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Acuity Brands, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Acuity Brands currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.38%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 4, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Acuity Brands (AYI) earns a Zacks Rank #2 four days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 4, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.73 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.73 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.54 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Acuity Brands has an Earnings ESP of 7.38%.AYI is part of a big group of Construction stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at KB Home (KBH) as well.KB Home is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on June 28, 2023. KBH's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.23 a share 89 days from its next earnings release.KB Home's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 8.73% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13.AYI and KBH's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

11,ce7d9427-5fbb-335d-8b10-c7b2ce9ae2f1,STT,2023-04-01,UPDATE 2-US Republicans challenge more fund managers on ESG,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-republicans-widen-challenge-170340111.html,1680282220,STORY,"['BLK', 'STT']","[(Adds comments from activist shareholder group As You Sow)By Ross KerberMarch 31 (Reuters) - Republican attorneys general from 21 U.S. states raised fresh concerns with asset managers over their consideration for environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the votes cast at U.S. corporate annual meetings getting under way this spring.The top state legal officers issued their challenge via a letter, provided by the office of Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen on Friday, sent to 53 of the largest U.S. fund firms including BlackRock Inc and the asset-management arms of State Street Corp and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.The letter marks the latest salvo in a growing political battle over what had been a quiet corner of finance.Companies and investors increasingly consider factors like climate change and workforce diversity, which they say can affect company performance and reputation. The approach has received backing from Democratic leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, who recently used his first veto to defend a rule on ESG investing.Meanwhile, Republicans, many from energy-producing states, have raised a growing chorus of challenges on ESG. The latest letter built on concerns many of the same attorneys general brought to BlackRock last August.In the new letter, dated March 30, the attorneys general told the asset managers that ""many of you have committed to take actions inconsistent with your clients' financial interests,"" such as by joining groups like the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which encourages members to help reduce global emissions.This can be a problem for fund participants who do not share ESG goals, the Republicans wrote. ""As far as we can tell, your non-ESG funds do not disclose to investors that their investments will be used to further ESG goals, including pressuring companies to reduce emissions in economically destructive ways,"" the letter states.Asset managers have argued that such memberships align with their fiduciary obligations, and some are giving clients more control over proxy votes.Story continuesBlackRock and State Street did not comment. JPMorgan declined to comment.Another section of the Republicans' letter describes several pending shareholder resolutions as ""pushing three companies to stop using Vanguard"" as their default retirement plan and noting Vanguard's fossil fuel investments.""Asset managers voting for the exclusion of one of their competitors has clear antitrust implications,"" the letter states.A representative for Knudsen said Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, the top U.S. mutual fund manager, was not among the recipients of the letter, because it had withdrawn from the Net Zero group, the rare fund manager to do so.Vanguard did not comment.The resolutions were filed by activist shareholder group As You Sow, which the Republicans suggested had targeted Vanguard over its withdrawal. As You Sow President Danielle Fugere said that was not correct as the group had filed similar resolutions last year, before Vanguard's December action.Fugere also said the letter mischaracterizes the resolutions, since they only ask for companies to issue reports on how they are protecting plan beneficiaries with long-term investment horizons from climate risk.The attorney general's letter, Fugere said, ""seems geared to chill asset manager votes.”(Reporting by Ross Kerber.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.State Street Corporation in FocusState Street Corporation (STT) is headquartered in Boston, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -3.31% since the start of the year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.63 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.36%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 4.52% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.73%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.52 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, State Street Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.44%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. State Street Corporation's current payout ratio is 34%, meaning it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for STT for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.58 per share, with earnings expected to increase 15.79% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, STT is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy over pure-play, value or growth approaches of investments.Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include PVH Corporation PVH, DICK'S Sporting Goods DKS, Urban Outfitters Inc. URBN, Embraer SA ERJ and APi Group Corporation APG.A Few More Words on GARPThe GARP theory enables the strategic mingling of growth and value-investing principles, which gives us a hybrid strategy by utilizing the best features of both. What GARPers look for is whether or not the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.However, the question that often arises is whether the market has an adequate number of companies that are growing earnings while trading at reasonable valuations? Going by a CFA Institute Blog by Nicolas Rabener, “on average, 38% of all stocks exhibit a PEG ratio below 1, which is more than enough for security selection.”Story continuesUnfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purposes)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $800 Million (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:PVH: Headquartered in New York, PVH Corp. specializes in designing and marketing branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, handbags and related products. The company's portfolio includes its owned and licensed brands. PVH Corp.’s owned brands comprise Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner’s, Olga and Geoffrey Beene.PVH Corp. is an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

In a 2021 project call with First Mile®, he began a journey that took him from exchanging smiles on video calls to logging miles on the running trail - with far reaching impact.First Mile, an initiative of Thread International and WORK, formalizes waste collection networks in low-income communities. It helps bridge the gap for global brands to purchase from responsible supply chains, while simultaneously diverting plastic waste from oceans and landfills.This reclaimed ocean-bound plastic, or ROBP, is used in the eco-friendly Diving Turtle and Serene Beach U.S. Bank debit card designs. It's estimated that for every million cards produced, more than one ton of plastic will be diverted from entering the world's oceans, waterways and shorelines.1WORK is the nonprofit entity in the First Mile private-nonprofit partnership. It's mission to ""accompany families in Haiti out of poverty through good, dignified jobs"" appealed to Gamble.""Not only does this partnership keep plastic out of the ocean,"" he said, ""but it does it in a way that gives the front-line workers ways to support their families and communities though education, health care, safety workshops and livable wages. That was something I wanted to support.""Gamble discovered he could support WORK's mission through Run Across May, a fundraiser that challenges individuals and teams to run 200 or more miles to raise funds and awareness for the organization. He joined the race that year, clocking in 222 miles in his hometown of Dundas, Minnesota. He ran the event again in 2022 for a total of 442 miles - an achievement that deepens his connection to First Mile and its mission - right alongside U.S. Bank.U.S. Bank and its customers commit to cleaner oceans, stronger communitiesU.S. Bank is committed to enabling a sustainable future through climate goals, client engagement and support, and vendor and community agreements. The relationship with First Mile supports the bank's environmental, social, governance (ESG) work through a positive impact on communities and the environment.Story continuesWhen customers choose an eco-friendly debit card from U.S. Bank, they help First Mile create supply chains that have already saved millions of pounds of plastic from landfills and oceans, as estimated by the organization. The project has the added benefit of creating well-paying jobs for thousands of plastic collectors in Haiti and beyond, providing financial stability to local communities across the globe.Customers are on board with this initiative, with 27% of all U.S. Bank debit cardmembers choosing the eco-friendly Diving Turtle or Serene Beach design, putting these two debit cards at the top of the U.S. Bank most popular design list.1.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.44%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.26%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.21%.Heading into today, shares of the fertilizer maker had lost 17.27% over the past month, lagging the Basic Materials sector's gain of 0.43% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.28% in that time.CF Industries will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.69, down 36.1% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.91 billion, down 33.44% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.95 per share and revenue of $7.81 billion, which would represent changes of -42.75% and -30.17%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for CF Industries. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

CF Industries is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Investors should also note CF Industries's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 7.23. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 7.25, which means CF Industries is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesWe can also see that CF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.2.

(CF) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-cf-industries-130001318.html,1680267601,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -17.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has lost 9.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $2.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -42.8%. This estimate has changed -6.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of -27% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for CF.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $1.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -33.4%. The $7.81 billion and $6.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -30.2% and -17.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.7%. EPS of $4.35 for the same period compares with $3.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.33%. The EPS surprise was +5.33%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF.

25,a3506811-8f34-369f-bb46-3be1a2f7a733,WMT,2023-04-01,Wall Street Analysts Think Walmart (WMT) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-walmart-133001700.html,1680269401,STORY,['WMT'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Walmart (WMT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.60, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.60 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.1% and 13.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Walmart, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in WMT?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.1% over the past month to $6.10.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

26,10006a4c-a866-36a5-9b28-c32e9d7a34ea,WMT,2023-04-01,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-walmart-inc-130001111.html,1680267601,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned +3.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has gained 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.10 points to a change of -3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.72 indicates a change of +10.2% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $148.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $631.3 billion and $651.48 billion estimates indicate +3.3% and +3.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $164.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.3%. EPS of $1.71 for the same period compares with $1.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $159.66 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +12.5%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, insiders find the chances of such a deal less likely.ByteDance, in recent weeks, has snubbed the prospect of a sale of its U.S. business. Last week, China said it would “firmly oppose” any such deal.ByteDance’s public opposition to a sale reportedly amounts to little more than playing hard to get their only way to get a full value for the divestment.A former CFIUS official said the Chinese government has no say over U.S. assets in U.S. jurisdiction, and the U.S. could force a sale at any time.Most legislation that aims to crack down on TikTok calls for a complete ban of the app in the U.S. rather than a divestiture.Last Thursday, Chew’s testimony before Congress proved a “disaster.”Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pegged the likelihood of an outright ban at “90%-plus” as Chew “came off [as] evasive” around the “sensitive China data topic.”Price Action: WMT shares closed higher by 1.01% at $145.68 on Thursday.Photo via Wikimedia CommonsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

However, subdued visitation in Macau remains a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for now.Factors Driving GrowthShares of MGM Resorts have gained 41.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 31.3%. The company is benefiting from strong brand recognition, pent-up consumer demand, high domestic casino spending and robust demand for sports betting. Also, it is gaining from increased visitation in the Las Vegas market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, net revenues at Las Vegas Strip Resorts were $2,297.3 million, up 27.2% year over year. The company benefited from increased business volume and travel activity on a year-over-year basis. Also, the addition of The Cosmopolitan and Aria added to the upside. During the quarter under review, net revenues from the company's regional operations totaled $991.5 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. The upside was primarily driven by an increase in business volume and travel activity. The company remains bullish on its domestic business outlook. Much optimism can be noted owing to attributes such as a rebound in convention business and increased international flight capacity.Sports betting and iGaming continues to be a major growth driver for the company. To this end, BetMGM continues to gain market share. Since its launch in 2018, the company has done extremely well and operates in 24 markets. It also announced a partnership with Carnival cruises to provide onboard ship betting and gaming under the BetMGM brand. It has also integrated its MGM Rewards program with BetMGM to drive higher-value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy. Given the unique and unparallel online and offline offerings, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth with revenue expectations of $1.8-$2 billion in 2023. The company expects to achieve positive EBITDA in the second half of 2023. The company is confident about the improved design and functionality of the BetMGM app launch (of a single wallet) and omnichannel growth prospects.The company emphasizes on international expansion to drive growth. To this end, MGM Resorts made progress related to development plans in Japan and Dubai. It stated plans to expand its footprint in New York. However, it is subject to regulatory approvals. The company also emphasized on the completion of the LeoVegas acquisition. The initiative supports the company’s expansion in international markets and online gaming and paves a path to drive its omnichannel strategy and generate incremental earnings between brick-and-mortar and online channels.Story continuesConcernsThe Gaming industry is currently grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and MGM Resorts isn’t immune to the trend. During fourth-quarter 2022, the company witnessed a dismal performance in the Macau region owing to subdued visitation. During the quarter, MGM China's net revenues fell 44.5% year over year to $174.7 million. The downside was mainly due to COVID-19-related property closures at MGM Cotai and travel and entry restrictions in Macau. Although the company resumed operations in most of its properties, traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels.

37,954fc428-4f70-3ef3-a953-8e2d8aff782f,MET,2023-04-01,Here's Why You Should Retain MetLife (MET) in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-metlife-met-155303916.html,1680277983,STORY,['MET'],"[MetLife, Inc. MET is well-poised to grow on the back of rising premiums, volume growth and improving contributions from the U.S. and Latin America businesses.MetLife continues to benefit from its strategic acquisitions, which are boosting its footprint in the insurance space. The company’s cost-saving initiatives are also aiding its margins. MetLife is an insurance-based global financial services company offering protection and investment products to individual and institutional customers.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceMET currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its shares have lost 8.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Optimistic Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MET’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $8.29 per share, indicating a 21% increase from the year-ago reported figure. The same for 2024 earnings is pegged at $9.07 per share, suggesting a 9.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Decent Surprise HistoryThe company beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 12.1%.Return on Equity (ROE)Return on equity, a measure reflecting how efficiently a company utilizes shareholders’ money, was 15.6% in the trailing 12 months, better than the industry average of 8.9%.Key DriversIn 2022, a significant portion of MET’s total revenues came from the U.S. segment, which improved 23.5% from 2021. Therefore, the company is putting efforts to grow the segment further. MET offers a diversified set of products under this segment and aims to meet employer and customer expectations by investing in the carrier. MET’s large-scale business enables it to add products and capabilities to enhance customer experience.The company continues to demonstrate its commitment to better execute the Next Horizon strategy. Under this strategy, it is supposed to generate strong free cash flows, streamline business operations, and differentiate its products through innovation, scale, brand and talent.Story continuesMET’s Latin America segment continued its growth trajectory, delivering strong top and bottom-line results. Improving awareness about its products and better quality should continue to drive growth of this segment in the future.MetLife undertakes various growth-related initiatives via strategic acquisitions. In 2022, MET completed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Poland and Greece. Strategic steps like this will help the company achieve higher profitability and add value to shareholders’ funds.Recently, MetLife’s asset management arm acquired Raven Capital, adding $2.1 billion to its assets under management. This acquisition will help MET strengthen its market position and expand its offerings in private credit investments.MetLife’s investment management arm is responsible for purchasing assets to match its liabilities well. The company considers its asset-liability management and diversified investment portfolio to be key differentiators. MET is also one of the largest originators of commercial and agricultural mortgages in the United States.MET has worked on its organic and inorganic growth fronts, and on expenses to improve profitability. It deployed $3.8 billion to enhance its organic business in 2022.MET generated strong free cash flows in 2022, which will help exceed the five-year target of $20 billion. The company also delivered operational efficiency by maintaining its full-year direct expense ratio of 12.2%.The company returned $4.9 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in 2022. It repurchased $250 million of common stock in January 2023. MET also pays a regular quarterly dividend, making it an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.Key ConcernThe company’s declining investment income and struggling Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segment are concerning. A softer investment income is hurting MET’s margins. The EMEA segment’s results are being impacted by weaker equity markets. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Multi line insurance space are Goosehead Insurance, Inc GSHD, Old Republic International Corporation ORI and Oscar Health, Inc. OSCR. Goosehead and Old Republic International currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Oscar Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Goosehead Insurance’s bottom line outpaced estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the other two.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for MetLife How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for MetLife is:9.4% = US$2.6b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.Does MetLife Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see MetLife has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Insurance industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 2 risks we have identified for MetLife visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining MetLife's Debt And Its 9.4% Return On EquityIt appears that MetLife makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.70. We consider it to be a negative sign when a company has a rather low ROE despite a rather high debt to equity.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: MetLife may not be the best stock to buy.

44,beeaaebb-fd5c-38b0-befd-70690acc86da,O,2023-04-01,Oil has good week but poor month; Even poorer quarter,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-good-week-poor-month-122306129.html,1680265386,STORY,"['UCO', 'SCO', 'CL=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Against the odds, oil bulls coasted to a second straight week of gains that sharply pared losses forced by the U.S. banking crisis two weeks ago. Yet, they fell short of turning March into a positive month, and took an even bigger hit for the quarter.By 11:30 ET (15:30 GMT), New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude was at $74.98 per barrel, up $1, or 1.3%, on the day, after a session high of $75.50 that marked a two-week peak. For the week, WTI was up about 8.5%.For the month though, the U.S. crude benchmark was off about 2.5%, while for the quarter, it showed a loss of more than 6%.London-traded Brent crude hovered at above $79, up about 1% on the day and around 7% higher on the week. For the month, the global crude benchmark was down almost 5% and for the quarter, it showed a loss of nearly 7%.“Oil prices are continuing to gradually recover but remain way off pre-banking mini-crisis levels,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.“The prolonged economic scarring of the last month will likely slow the economy, if not cause a recession,” Erlam said, adding that the recovery may be slow as inventors learn of the longer-term consequences from this month’s banking crisis, with lower interest rate expectations unlikely to help much.Notwithstanding those concerns, this week's gains in oil were supported by bullish demand data on both crude and gasoline.Crude prices could also see further support next week from a meeting of producer group OPEC+ — which has been orchestrating market support in recent months with words more than the production cuts it promised.OPEC+ — an alliance of the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 independent oil producers steered by Russia — is supposed to be practicing a daily output cut of two million barrels. But overproduction by the group is reported commonly, with the refrain being that the market is still balanced.Story continuesHeadlines out of Moscow last week said Russian crude production fell by 300,000 barrels per day in the first three weeks of March, to 9.78M barrels per day. That was, however, still below the 500,000 bpd cut pledged by the Kremlin.Russia’s “fire-sale” of its Urals crude — at $60 a barrel or lower, in compliance with Western sanctions related to the Ukraine war — has been cited as one of the reasons for the inability of the oil market to command a constantly high price for WTI and Brent. Major crude buyers such as India and China have sourced cheap supplies from Russia for months now and cut back on pricier supply from other oil producers, including Saudi Arabia.Related ArticlesOil has good week but poor month; Even poorer quarterOil rises more than 1% on tightening supplies, cooling US inflationExclusive-Climate row roils U.N.-backed group of insurers and pension funds]"

Both benchmarks are trading close to two-week highs.Data released Friday showed that the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures index rose just 0.3% in February, below the 0.4% expected, while the annual figure came in at 4.6%, below the 4.7% predicted.While this represented only a small drop from expectations, these are the Federal Reserve’s most closely watched inflation figures and add fuel to the talk that the U.S. central bank could pause its rate-hiking cycle when it next meets in May as it digests the potential hit to activity caused by the banking turmoil.Adding to the positive tone were the business activity figures out of China earlier Friday.China’s official composite purchasing managers index, a rough real-time proxy for economic activity, hit its highest level since before the pandemic. The improvement was due entirely to non-manufacturing, while the manufacturing PMI, which tracks mainly the country’s big state-owned enterprises, fell slightly, although still came in higher than expected.China is the world’s largest importer of crude, and expectations of a sharp recovery in demand as its economy reacts to the withdrawal of COVID-19 restrictions have provided underlying support for most of this year.That said, both crude benchmarks are still on course for monthly drops of around 6%, after hitting their lowest levels since 2021 earlier in the month in the wake of the banking turbulence.Looking at the supply side, the European Commission said this week that the $60-a-barrel cap on the price of Russian oil is proving effective in hurting the Kremlin’s access to petrodollars while not disrupting the market, and will remain unchanged for now.Story continuesAdditionally, U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week, with the Energy Information Administration recording a 7.5 million-barrel drop in crude inventories to a two-year low.Attention next week will be the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+.This committee has the power to recommend output changes to the wider group, but is not expected to agree to another output cut beyond the 2 million barrels per day it announced in November.“The group would have taken comfort in the market appearing to have stabilised following the turmoil seen in financial markets over March,” said analysts at ING, in a note.The release of the CFTC’s net positioning data and the Baker Hughes' rig count later in the session round off the week.Related ArticlesCrude oil higher; Chinese PMI, U.S. inflation data helpBiden calls on Russia to release US reporter: ""Let him go""Oil ticks up as U.S. inflation cools, but prices set for monthly drop]"

(NYSE: FE) electric company personnel are preparing to respond to service interruptions caused by another spring severe weather system that is expected to bring strong wind gusts and potential thunderstorms this weekend to Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The system is expected to bring wind gusts of 40 to 50 miles per hour – and potentially higher in some areas – starting on Friday and extending into Saturday evening, with an additional risk of scattered thunderstorms on Saturday. The high winds could slow restoration efforts, as crews cannot safely operate bucket trucks when wind speeds exceed 40 miles per hour.The new weather system follows heavy rain and wind last weekend that caused a significant number of outages in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. While this weekend's weather may not be as severe, it is expected to have an impact on customers across all the states served by FirstEnergy.In anticipation of this new weather system, FirstEnergy has kept more than 200 contractors and outside support personnel in place from last weekend's restoration effort. FirstEnergy crews are also pre-staging at service centers across its territory to be ready to respond once the storm hits.""With another round of strong wind gusts that could bring trees and branches down on our lines and equipment, we have crews standing by to address potential damage,"" said Sam Belcher, senior vice president of FirstEnergy and president of FirstEnergy Utilities. ""While these severe weather events are not unusual for this time of year, we understand that outages are difficult for our customers and will work to restore service as quickly and safely as possible.""FirstEnergy's electric companies are implementing storm response plans, which include staffing additional operators, damage assessors and analysts at distribution control centers, and arranging to bring in additional line, substation and forestry personnel, as needed, based on the severity of the weather. FirstEnergy representatives have also been in contact with emergency management officials, state officials, regulators and local officials about the company's storm preparation efforts.Story continuesHow to Report Power Outages and Downed Lines Customers who experience a service interruption due to the storm are encouraged to report their outage by texting OUT to LIGHTS (544487), clicking the ""Report Outage"" link on www.firstenergycorp.com or calling 1-888-LIGHTSS (1-888-544-4877).FirstEnergy customers can sign up to receive email and text message alert notifications for updates after they've reported a power outage. Customers can also use two-way text messaging to report outages, request updates on restoration efforts and make other inquiries about their electric accounts.

Stay at least 30 feet away and use extra caution where downed lines are tangled in trees or other debris. Report downed lines ASAP by calling 911.For updated information on the company's current outages, the company's storm restoration process and tips for staying safe, visit FirstEnergy's 24/7 Power Center at www.firstenergycorp.com/outages.Customers Encouraged to Prepare and Stay SafeFirstEnergy encourages customers to plan for the possibility of power outages due to the impending storm by following these tips:Keep electronic devices such as cell phones, laptops and tablets fully charged.Have a car charger on-hand to charge mobile devices if your power is out. If you have a smart phone, this will ensure you have access to online information sources.Keep a flashlight, portable radio and extra batteries handy in the event of a power outage. Tune to a local station for current storm information.Use care when burning candles; open flames are a dangerous fire hazard.Do not use gas stoves, kerosene heaters or other open-flame heat sources to prevent deadly carbon monoxide gas from building up in your home.If you have a water well and pump, keep an emergency supply of bottled water and/or fill your bathtub with fresh water.Stock an emergency supply of convenience foods that do not require cooking.Consider having a hard-wired phone available to report an outage or emergency. A plain, hard-wired phone can operate on power delivered through the phone line.Operate Backup Generators SafelyEmergency power generators offer an option for customers needing or wanting uninterrupted service. To ensure the safety of the home's occupants as well as that of electric company employees who may be working on power lines in the area, the proper generator should be selected and installed by a qualified electrician.When operating a generator, the power coming into the home should always be disconnected. Otherwise, power from the generator could be sent back onto the power lines, creating a hazardous situation for company workers. Locate the generator outside of your home and far away from windows, doors and vents. Never locate a generator inside your home.View additional generator safety information.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence.

Founded in 2006 by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, the company's primary product is the HubSpot Growth Platform, an all-in-one solution that combines these distinct channels and more. The company uses ""freemium"" tactics to drive customer growth, which was 24% year over year in 2022. HubSpot now has over 167,000 customers, with 8,400 customers added in the fourth quarter.Warning!

It is generally able to automate much of the customer touchpoints and onboarding to scale. Costs are relatively fixed and the margins are incredible.Story continuesHubSpot - Great Service, Bad PriceHUBS Data by GuruFocusMany companies choose to sacrifice short-term profits by maximizing sales and marketing spend. It's a luxury that subscription models can afford better than other models, considering the premium investors are willing to pay for revenue growth and the promise of future profits.The crucial aspect of HubSpot's strategy is targeting the small- and medium-sized business (SMB) segment, where it can customize offerings to cater to businesses of specific sizes. By providing free tiers and scalable pricing options based on feature requirements, HubSpot ensures a smooth onboarding experience and a comprehensive suite of tools that serve as a nearly all-in-one solution.HubSpot has become the go-to option for many SMBs, which have often been overlooked by cloud software providers. The company's ability to consistently develop and deliver high-quality additional features enables a land-and-expand approach, which serves as a key competitive advantage for HubSpot. 98% of HubSpot's revenue comes from subscription services, which are very sticky. Companies are pushing more on soft marketing and utilizing social media to attract customers, rather than relying on direct sales. As a result, HubSpot's share of the overall CRM market could continue to expand.FinancialsFor a company that has been around since 2006, it should be profitable at this point. Yet, despite enjoying gross margins of 82%, HubSpot has decided to spend a large chunk of its profits on research and development. In 2013, the company had $15 million in R&amp;D expenses on $50 million in gross profit. Not much seems to have actually changed in the product since then, but the R&amp;D expense has risen to $422 million. This expense puts the company considerably in the red, taking up nearly 30% of its operating expenses. By comparison, industry leader Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) only spends 21% on R&amp;D.HubSpot - Great Service, Bad PriceSome metrics are not so great for a technology company. HubSpot, like many of these SaaS operations, needs a lot of people to function properly. It has over 7,000 employees and generates around $235,000 in revenue per employee. In comparison, Salesforce gets over $390,000 in sales per employee.The company also needs to address the issues surrounding stock-based compensation dragging down profitability as well. I think it spends way too much to compensate its top executives considering the company's continued lack of profitability.That being said, 2023 is all about artificial intelligence, and OpenAI's GPT platform may allow HubSpot to drive more revenue per employee. I hope the company decides to tap into AI as a source of growth, as I believe this could help a lot. Only time will tell whether or not the company can utilize it well.ValuationHistorically, it has been a bad idea to bet against the technology industry as a whole. However, that alone does not make HubSpot worth owning, as the tech industry has more duds than winners.HubSpot is currently experiencing a rather dramatic slowdown. The company anticipates $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion in revenue for 2023, which equates to nearly 19% year over year growth. This comes after 33% growth during 2022 and 47% revenue growth in 2021. At this rate, it would take another 16 years to reach the level Salesforce is at today.Of course, the stock's current multiples are based on an incredible growth rate achieved in the last five years, which is slowing considerably. Thus, I think it is likely only a matter of time before the market re-adjusts HubSpot's value lower.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Shares have added about 5.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Salesforce Q4 Earnings and Revenues Beat EstimatesSalesforce reported better-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings doubled to $1.68 per share from the 84 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36.The quarterly non-GAAP earnings included a loss of 25 cents per share from the mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. However, the company’s ongoing restructuring initiative, which includes trimming the workforce, benefited fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings by 9 cents per share.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $8.38 billion climbed 14% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion. The top line also improved 17% in constant currency (cc).The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.Coming to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (93% of the total revenues) increased 14.1% from the year-earlier period to $7.79 billion. Professional Services and Other (7% of total sales) revenues climbed 19.5% to $595 million.Under the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 13% year over year to $1.8 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud, one of the company’s largest and fastest-growing businesses, also improved 13% to $1.9 billion.Story continuesMarketing &amp; Commerce Cloud revenues jumped 13% to $1.2 billion. Salesforce Platform and Other revenues were up 15% to $1.6 billion. Also, revenues from Data increased 18% year over year to $1.3 billion.Geographically, Salesforce registered revenue growth of 14% in America (67.5% of the total revenues), 30% in the Asia Pacific (9.4%) and 20% in the EMEA (23.1%) on a year-over-year basis.Salesforce’s gross profit came in at $6.28 billion, up 18.3% from the prior-year period. Moreover, the gross margin improved 200 basis points (bps) to 75%.Salesforce recorded a non-GAAP operating income of $2.45 billion, up 123.3% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.1 billion. Moreover, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded 1,420 bps to 29.2% from 15% in the year-ago quarter due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of total sales. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 71% from 75% in the year-ago quarter.Salesforce exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $12.5 billion, up from the $11.9 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.CRM generated operating cash flow of $2.79 billion and free cash flow of $2.57 billion in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2023, the company generated operating and free cash flows of $7.11 billion and $6.31 billion, respectively.As of Jan 31, 2023, the current remaining performance obligation reflecting revenues under contract for the next 12 months was $24.6 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. In the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2023, the company bought back shares worth $2.32 billion and $4 billion, respectively.Concurrent with its fourth-quarter results, Salesforce announces the expansion of its ongoing share repurchase program to $20 billion from the initial announcement of $10 billion made in 2022. With the total fiscal 2023 buyback of $4 billion, the company has now $16 billion remaining under its current authorization limit.Strong Guidance for Q1 and FY24Salesforce provided strong guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2024. For the fiscal first quarter, Salesforce projects total sales between $8.16 billion and $8.18 billion (midpoint $8.17 billion).The revenue guidance includes a $150-million negative impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Furthermore, CRM anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of $1.60-$1.61 for the current quarter.For fiscal 2024, Salesforce forecasts revenues in the range of $34.5-$34.7 billion. The company expects no impact from foreign currency exchange rates.The company projects fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings between $7.12 and $7.14 per share. Salesforce estimates a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% for the fiscal and expects a year-over-year increase in operating cash flow in the 15 range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 61.49% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Salesforce.com has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

(CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-trending-stock-130001284.html,1680267601,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 12.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +61.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +55.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 indicates a change of +23.7% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +26.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.17 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +11.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Ralph Lauren has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Lululemon has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that RL has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.RL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.08, while LULU has a forward P/E of 31.41. We also note that RL has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. LULU currently has a PEG ratio of 1.57.Another notable valuation metric for RL is its P/B ratio of 3.06. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LULU has a P/B of 14.50.Based on these metrics and many more, RL holds a Value grade of B, while LULU has a Value grade of D.Story continuesRL has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LULU, so it seems like value investors will conclude that RL is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An amount equal to net proceeds of the bonds will finance or refinance projects designed to support PG&amp;E's carbon reduction and sustainability goals.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)The bonds were designated as sustainability bonds consistent with PG&amp;E's recently published Sustainable Finance Framework, which was reviewed by S&amp;P Global Ratings. Sustainability bonds are a designation for capital raises to finance investments with intended environmental and social benefits. The sustainability bond offering follows two green bond offerings in November 2021 and November 2022 by PG&amp;E Recovery Funding LLC and sponsored by PG&amp;E, and is the first under PG&amp;E's recently published Sustainable Finance Framework.""As recent powerful storms have once again made clear, California is on the front line of the climate crisis.

PG&amp;E released its Climate Strategy Report last year, outlining its breakthrough commitments to reduce carbon emissions, help reverse the impacts of climate change and begin to heal the planet. These commitments include becoming ""climate positive"" by 2050—going beyond net zero emissions and actively reducing and removing more greenhouse gases from the environment than it emits.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE: PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

It did so through its affiliated company, Marathon E.G. Holding Limited. The deal is aimed at advancing the next phases (Phases II and III) of the Equatorial Guinea Regional Gas Mega Hub. Investors should know that Chevron got hold of the assets in the West African country, as part of its $5 billion acquisition of Noble Energy in 2020.According to Marathon Oil chairman, president, and CEO, Lee Tillman, the announcement builds on the company’s successful partnership with the E.G. Government for more than 20 years, further leveraging and extending the life of E.G.'s world-class gas monetization infrastructure, including the crucial E.G. LNG facility, into the next decade.Phase I of the abovementioned gas mega hub (GMH) was effectively completed with the tieback of the Alen Field to Punta Europa, which began delivering gas in February 2021. Alen gas is processed through the LNG facility, owned by Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Ltd. (E.G. LNG, MRO 56% interest) and the onshore Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) factory operated by Alba factory LLC (MRO 52% stake).The announced HOA draws on the success of Phase I, uniting all stakeholders around the essential commercial principles to advance the GMH’s Phases II and III.The processing of gas from the Alba Unit (MRO 64% interest) will take place under new contractual conditions beginning Jan 1, 2024, following the expiration of the old Henry Hub-linked Alba sales and purchase deal at the end of this year.Phase II is anticipated to considerably increase the company's E.G. profits and cash flow while also materially increasing MRO's exposure to LNG pricing on a global scale. Gas processing from the Aseng Field is anticipated to become easier by Phase III of the GMH at Punta Europa infrastructure.Story continuesThe GMH can be further expanded through the expedited monetization of cross-border wet gas fields, owing to a recently established bilateral treaty between E.G. and Cameroon on cross-border oil and gas development. In addition to its commercial advantages, the expanded development also guarantees future fuel gas volumes for E.G.'s power production requirements and creates long-term job prospects for Equatoguineans.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Marathon Oil carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).

Overall, the S&amp;P 500 finished the first quarter up 7% and rose for the second-straight quarter, which Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees as the start of something bigger for markets.Former President Donald Trump's indictment late Thursday also didn't move markets, but will be carefully watched for implications on the looming debt ceiling debate this summer and 2024 election, pros say.""At this point, the view that Trump could benefit from his legal troubles has almost become conventional wisdom, to the extent that 'actually it is bad to be indicted' is now a contrarian take,"" said Evercore ISI strategist Tobin Marcus.""But we have been making this argument since last summer, and we still believe it. We maintain our view that Trump is a strong frontrunner for the GOP nomination.""But with first quarter earnings season right around the corner and the start of the second quarter coming up on Monday, let's set 2024 aside for now and go through a few other key items that caught Yahoo Finance's attention this week.1. Foot Locker runs into its futureSome seven months into the CEO job at Foot Locker (FL), Mary Dillon told me at Shoptalk in Las Vegas this week she is trying to ensure the company is around for the next 50 years to serve sneakerheads.""We are the OG of sneakers and are really refocusing on all things sneakers,"" Dillon said.The Foot Locker store in Broomfield, Colorado is seen November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Rick WilkingDillon has wasted no time in outlining her goals to Wall Street and repairing a damaged relationship with Nike (NKE), as we noted earlier this week. Given Dillon's impressive eight-year track track record as CEO of Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker investors should rest assured they have a top flight leader.Story continuesYou can read more on what we learned at Shoptalk here.Stat Share: Foot Locker shares are up 8% since Dillon was announced as CEO in late August 2022, out-performing the S&amp;P 500's 2.1% drop.2. Lyft hails a new CEOAfter a series of bad quarters amid market share losses to larger rival Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) has ordered a new leader for its corner office.With the stock down 77% in the past year, the move to replace co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer operationally at least wasn't a total shock to Wall Street (both will stay on the board).Enter Amazon- and Microsoft-trained David Risher, who has also been a Lyft board member for about 18 months. Risher told Yahoo Finance Live he is focused on getting back to basics at Lyft, which may include further expense cuts.Risher also didn't rule out a sale of Lyft at some point.""We always look at options and people approach us from time to time. Right now our focus is on creating such a great service that in whatever configuration, we are going to be relevant — valuable — either as a standalone company or something else,"" Risher said.Stat Share: Lyft investors will have to wait to for Risher's operational magic honed at Amazon and Microsoft — he doesn't officially start as Lyft's CEO until April 17.3. FAANG shows its teeth, finallyOmnipresent tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush tells me big-cap tech stocks are the new safety trade among investors seeking shelter during the bank crisis. He looks to be on the mark, at the moment.The first quarter saw the return of rabid buying interest in the FAANG complex — more formally known as Meta Platforms (META) (née Facebook), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOGL) (née Google). The best-performing FAANG stock in the quarter was Meta, which saw shares rise more than 70% as investors warmed up to the profit potential this year from major cost-cuts.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The worst-performing FAANG stock in the quarter was Netflix, which rose a mere 15% with some subscriber unhappiness fueled by a password crackdown reports Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Since last May, however, Netflix stock has doubled.All FAANG stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500's 7% increase in the quarter.Stat Share: All of the FAANG stocks fell by double-digit percentages in 2022, led by a 64% plunge in Meta.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Now they’re dumping millions of square feet of office space, pushing vacancies in city centers to record highs and ratcheting up pressure on the commercial real estate industry.Most Read from BloombergWarner Bros. Nears Deal for Harry Potter Online TV SeriesUBS Chairman’s Top-Secret Prep Paid Off in Credit Suisse MomentChina’s Yuan Replaces Dollar as Most Traded Currency in RussiaBernard Arnault’s Fortune Soars Past $200 Billion for First TimeChicago Elects Tax Proponent, Progressive Johnson as MayorNo sector is looking to sublease more office space than Big Tech, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have all announced plans to reduce their office footprint. Amazon has paused construction at a new campus near Washington, DC, and Microsoft is reevaluating plans for a project in Atlanta.Some 174 million square feet of office space — double San Francisco’s entire inventory — is available for sublease across the US, according to real estate brokerage firm Savills. That’s almost twice what was available pre-pandemic, Savills said.Companies looking to sublease space are still on the hook for rent for the entirety of the lease. But the retrenchment shows how the tech downturn, which contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and turmoil in financial markets, is spilling into the broader economy.San Francisco, Seattle and New York are bearing the brunt of the pullback. While New York can count on office demand from financial services and legal firms, tech-centric San Francisco has no such cushion. Seattle business groups, meanwhile, are calling for a tax holiday to keep tenants downtown.“During the pandemic, tech companies were the only source of growth for landlords as these companies were expanding their operations, hiring aggressively and taking big blocks of space,” said Ruth Colp-Haber, chief executive officer of the brokerage Wharton Property Advisors. “This is not the only headwind facing real estate, but it is a significant one because no other industry has emerged to replace tech.”Story continuesBig Tech’s retreat couldn’t come at a worse time for the office real estate market, already stuck with partially empty buildings thanks to flexible work policies, and struggling to refinance loans amid rising interest rates. In a potentially ominous sign, landlords such as Brookfield Corp. and one tied to Pacific Investment Management Co. are opting to default on debt in an effort to secure better terms. The situation is expected to deteriorate because about $900 billion in commercial-property debt is maturing this year and next.City AmenitiesTech companies historically operated from sleepy suburban enclaves. Then during the boom of the 2010s, they began moving into pricier urban precincts in the hopes that city amenities — dog walkers, restaurants, modern condos — would help them recruit young talent.Twitter Inc. occupied an historic San Francisco building. Google established outposts on a Manhattan pier and near Seattle’s Lake Union. Facebook scooped up more than half a skyscraper in New York’s Hudson Yards. As recently as late 2019, tech companies accounted for almost 40% of new leases and relocations in Manhattan alone, according to Savills.Then the reckoning arrived. Americans, having spent two-plus years gorging on services from the likes of Amazon, DoorDash and Zoom, largely reverted to their pre-pandemic behavior. And an industry accustomed to double-digit growth rushed to shed workers and real estate. Alphabet, Meta, Netflix Inc., Salesforce Inc. and a few other publicly traded tech companies have earmarked as much as $3.4 billion to cover such costs as brokerage fees, writedowns and worker relocation expenses for buildings they no longer need, according to securities filings and earnings call transcripts.“For the first time in over 20 years, you’re seeing fiscal discipline in the tech sector,” said Scott Homa, a researcher at Jones Lang LaSalle. “Companies are throttling back their headcounts, their perks and their real estate.”Institutional investors have defaulted on more than $1 billion worth of loans backed by offices leased to tech tenants. Many owners are struggling to pay off existing debt or get refinancing, due to uncertainty around office values and falling rental income. According to CBRE Econometric Advisors, office owners face a $53 billion financing gap through 2025, likely leading to distress for investors. Major lenders have been avoiding office loans as regulators clamp down on riskier commercial property deals.The pain will almost certainly worsen. Salesforce, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Twitter and Alphabet alone have more than 12 million square feet of combined office leases set to expire across the US in the next three years, the equivalent of more than eight Salesforce towers, according to data from CoStar Group Inc.In New York, Meta has already opted not to renew leases for Park Avenue offices and newer space in Hudson Yards. Twitter and Compass Inc. also put up much of their Manhattan office space for sublease in recent months. Lyft Inc. is looking to sublease its San Francisco offices, while Twitter is battling a Pimco-owned landlord on missed rent payment there.Microsoft plans to vacate most of the 2.7 million square feet of office space with leases expiring in the Seattle area. Amazon has at least two large leases expiring in Seattle that it doesn’t plan to renew. Google is ending leases for a number of unoccupied spaces and still evaluating the timing of its move into a former shopping mall converted into offices in West Los Angeles. Netflix is looking to sublease two large buildings at its headquarters in Los Gatos, California.Cities have enjoyed a nascent rebound in economic activity since tech and other companies began leaning harder on employees to return to the office. But those gains are fragile and could be reversed as tech companies cut thousands of workers and consolidate them into fewer buildings.San Francisco has been particularly hard hit and suffers from falling property values and an ongoing homelessness and drug crisis. Mayor London Breed in February unveiled an economic recovery plan that includes an effort to transform the downtown and attract a more diverse set of employers, including life sciences, health care, artificial intelligence and climate tech companies.In Seattle, worker foot traffic remains less than half pre-pandemic levels, according to the Downtown Seattle Association. Sidewalks and restaurants on Amazon’s once bustling campus are empty, and the company recently closed two of its Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores in the city.In New York, workers are showing up three days a week but mostly disappear on Mondays and Fridays. In Manhattan, they’re spending at least $12.4 billion less a year, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. That’s money not being spent on meals, shopping and entertainment near their offices — purchases that long powered the city’s economy.--With assistance from Davey Alba, John Gittelsohn, Brody Ford and Aisha Counts.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsA Giant Rail Merger Escapes Washington’s Big Deal CrackdownWhy Cheaper Insulin Today Risks Higher Costs Later©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Companies including Amazon AMZN, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, Meta Platform META, Microsoft MSFT and Twitter have fired several employees dedicated to ensuring the conscious development of AI to cut further costs.These staff are among the thousands affected by the recent waves of layoffs at these companies amid persistent inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty over how tightening financial conditions will affect the economy.Responsible AI teams are among the only internal bastions that big tech have to make sure that people and communities impacted by AI systems are in the minds of the engineers who build them.Exclusive new data from a London-based analytics startup show that the five biggest tech firms have an estimated army of 33,000 people working directly on AI research and development, with Amazon boasting the largest pool of AI-focused employees at 10,113. Microsoft has 7,133 AI staff and Google has 4,970, according to Glass.ai, which used machine-learning technology to scrutinize tech company websites and thousands of LinkedIn profiles of their AI-focused employees.With tools such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI‘s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and Anthropic’s Claude bringing a new wave of generative AI innovation, the ethical nature and safety of the technology has been called into question.Misinformation and bias are among the risks that the technology has been found to be susceptible to. Advanced AI systems are expected to eventually replace some jobs in the financial, media, legal and technology sectors.More than a thousand specialists and academics, including Twitter owner Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, asked the big companies to stop the development of AI models, until it is known with certainty that its effects will be positive and its risks will be manageable.Story continuesYear-To-Date PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTech Giants Assure Commitment Toward Ethical AI PracticesMeta disbanded its responsible innovation team back in September 2022, which affected 20 engineering and ethicist roles overseeing the evaluation of civil rights and ethics on Facebook and Instagram. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has just unveiled new inventory filters for Facebook and Instagram Feeds, now accessible to advertisers in English- and Spanish-speaking markets. Meta has also developed a multi-stage AI review system to classify content for advertisers, ensuring brand suitability controls are implemented. This system complements existing technology that identifies content that violates or potentially violates Meta’s Community Standards and Guidelines. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for META first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.94 per share, indicating a decline of 28.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Microsoft is leading the AI release race since it partnered with OpenAI. This alliance has allowed it to incorporate ChatGPT technology into many of its tools, including Bing and Microsoft 365. In this period, the company received some complaints about biases, inaccuracies and inappropriate behavior of this AI model. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company dissolved the entire ethics and society team last January, with the company stating that the departments consisted of less than 10 members of staff, and that hundreds were still actively working in responsible AI, as well as growth of responsible AI operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT fiscal third-quarter 2023 earnings is pegged at $2.22 per share, indicating flat year-over-year performance.Some employees in charge of AI ethics supervision at Google were recently fired, among a larger group of 12,000 workers at Alphabet. Google has not reported how many roles were removed. However, this Zacks Rank #3 company has assured that responsible AI remains a top priority. The company had already been in the midst of controversy in 2020 and 2021, when two of its AI ethics research leaders, Margaret Mitchell and Timnit Gebru, were fired. Google is striking a partnership to combine its artificial intelligence language models with software from startup Replit Inc. that helps computer programmers write code in a bid to compete with a similar product from Microsoft Corp.’s GitHub and OpenAI.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.05 per share, indicating a decline of 14.63% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The announcement comes just one week after Microsoft-owned Github announced the launch of Copilot X, an upgraded version of its AI-driven software development platform that adopts the latest OpenAI GPT-4 model and expands Copilot’s capabilities, adding chat and voice features and allowing developers to get instant answers to questions about projects.This sets up a battle between Microsoft and Google to determine which company can provide the most attractive platform and tools for software developers.Amazon recently announced that it was laying off 9,000 more staff in the coming weeks, adding to some 18,000 previously disclosed job cuts. It is likely that many of Amazon’s latest layoffs will be concentrated in its struggling Alexa business. Amazon had about 10,000 staff working on Alexa back in November 2022 and while that number will likely include many sales and marketing staff, there will also be significant overlap with the 10,000 AI-focused staff. Amazon-owned Twitch made similar cuts in this area last week. Last week, this Zacks Rank #3 company’s Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) and NVIDIA NVDA announced a multi-part collaboration focused on building out the world’s most scalable, on-demand AI infrastructure optimized for training increasingly complex large language models and developing generative AI applications.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at 20 cents per share, indicating a decline of 4.76% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) share price is up 96% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 64% (not including dividends).The past week has proven to be lucrative for Sysco investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the three years of share price growth, Sysco actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 7.5% per year.So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.It could be that the revenue growth of 11% per year is viewed as evidence that Sysco is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthSysco is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Sysco stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Sysco's TSR for the last 3 years was 110%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Sysco returned a loss of 4.5% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 11%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sysco better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Sysco (at least 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

If you want to see more best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years, go directly to 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years.There are different definitions for growth stocks. For this article, we define high growth as a stock with an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10%.Considering a stock can have a high EPS next 5 year ratio by starting off with a small profit base, the best growth stocks also have other compelling characteristics such as competitive advantages, long term growth potential, and ideally a history of profitability. For those of you interested, check out 12 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable.In terms of the next 5 years, one of the biggest growth sectors will likely be AI given how transformative the technology could be.According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI alone could eventually increase global GDP by 7%. Specifically, analysts at the investment bank said, ""The boost to global labor productivity could also be economically significant, and we estimate that AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%"" although the exact timing and the exact effect size could be difficult to estimate according to the analysts.To put the 7% number into perspective, global GDP was $96.53 trillion in 2021 according to The World Bank. According to Statista, the global economy had a GDP of $101.6 trillion in 2022, the first time it surpassed $100 trillion. 7% of $101.6 trillion would be $7.11 trillion, larger than the nominal GDP of Japan. For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.While the vast majority of the increase in global GDP will benefit various firms throughout the global economy by allowing them to create more goods and services, the leading tech companies that have invested tens of billions into AI and that have one of the three largest cloud computing businesses could also benefit from more demand as well.Story continuesGiven how fast the AI sector is developing, it is very difficult to pick exact stocks that will do well. One company can lag behind others for a variety of reasons. If the sector is winner take all, there could really only be one or a few companies that do well.Given the sector is so uncertain, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Computer, memory, processorPhoto by Liam Briese on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years, we chose 12 stocks with competitive advantages that have an EPS next 5 year ratios of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We also included Amazon.com, Inc.

The company has an EPS Next 5 Year Ratio of 10.34% largely because it has a small earnings base given its P/E ratio of 36.21. While the company's near term is uncertain and could have more downside, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is attractive long term given its strong brand name and normalized earnings power. Analysts expect the company's EPS to grow and the financial giant has a forward P/E of 13.69.51 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) at the end of Q4, down from 61 at the end of Q3.7. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59EPS Next 5 Year Ratio: 29.80%ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has an EPS Next 5 Year Ratio of 29.80% in part given its smaller EPS base considering its P/E ratio of 44.03. While the EPS Next 5 Year Ratio doesn't accurately reflect the company's growth, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) nevertheless has long term growth potential given it is at least several years ahead of its competitors in making equipment that are essential for the manufacture of advanced semiconductors which power many modern devices. For full year 2022, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)'s net sales rose 14% year over year to €21.2 billion with EUV system sales rising 12% year over year to €7 billion.6. NextEra Energy, Inc.

The move is expected to draw more shoppers to SPG’s shopping centers, making it a strategic fit.The JAG portfolio includes globally renowned dining, ranging from Michelin-starred fine dining to fast casual eateries. With the introduction of unmatched culinary experiences at Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto and The Shops at Crystals, JAG is set to step into new markets and expand its footprint in existing anchor cities.JAG will also introduce Zaytinya — an innovative mezze menu inspired by Turkish, Greek and Lebanese cuisines, built on José Andrés' deep knowledge of Mediterranean cooking and years of research and travel — to The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.The new restaurants are expected to open in 2023-2024.Per Jonathan Murphy, co-president, Simon Malls, “We are proud of this announcement, which continues our commitment to owning and developing properties with premier dining and mixed-use experiences.”Simon Property has been exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, as it helps capture the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.In November 2022, Nobu Hospitality and Simon Property celebrated the opening of Nobu Hotel &amp; Restaurant Atlanta at the mixed-use development — Phipps Plaza — in Buckhead.Additionally, Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well in recent years. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. It is also focused on tapping growth opportunities by helping digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.In November 2022, Simon Property announced that Leap, the retail platform for modern brands, will open numerous stores at its properties. The move will help many digitally native brands to strategically expand as omni-channel retailers.Further, Simon Property capitalized on purchasing recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. Investments in them seem strategic for Simon Property as the brands have been generating a decent amount from digital sales.The increase in consumers’ preference for an in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand. As a result, SPG’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad has been experiencing solid leasing activity.In 2022, it signed 1,262 new and 1,517 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment, and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.With a solid balance-sheet position and ample financial flexibility, SPG is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 18.2% in the past six months compared with its industry’s growth of 13.4%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The good news is that volatility created many solid value stocks to buy. And, after all, a highly profitable firm bought at a sufficiently low price should reward investors with a solid margin of safety and the potential for well above-average returns. In fact, these seven value stocks to buy, in particular, have promising outlooks for the rest of 2023. And, as of this writing, all are selling for less than 15 times forward earnings meaning they are selling at valuations much below the S&amp;P 500 as a whole.GSGoldman Sachs$316.57VZVerizon$38.02AAPAdvance Auto Parts$116.01GPNGlobal Payments$98.95TSNTyson Foods$57.85BPBP.$37.38SQMSociedad Química y Minera de Chile$82.02Value Stocks to Buy: Goldman Sachs (GS)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comBank stocks were slammed over the past month. And with understandable reason. Several prominent banks failed, and more are struggling to adapt to the rapidly-changing interest rate environment.That said, investors shouldn’t give up on the whole sector. Banks are often among the best value stocks to buy, and the current industry consolidation will favor the industry leaders. That includes Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman is known for its skilled trading. The firm made profits in the 2008 financial crisis betting against failing mortgages, for example, while most other banks were caught horribly on the wrong side of the market. Goldman, with its world-class trading team and institutional banking chops, is in a great position to ride out the current volatility and make the most of shifting market opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsShares have pulled back nearly 15% from their recent highs. This puts GS stock at less than 10 times forward earnings. It also trades at just 1.0x book value which has been an excellent entry point for Goldman Sachs shares historically. While weak banks may continue to flounder, leaders like Goldman Sachs are set to take advantage and the current price marks a value opportunity.Story continuesValue Stocks to Buy: Verizon (VZ)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockTelecom stocks are usually viewed as stable blue-chip stocks. Unfortunately, the past year damaged that idea. Rival AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) slashed its dividend following some ill-advised acquisitions which left it in an excessive amount of debt. However, I believe investors unfairly punished Verizon (NYSE:VZ) for other firms’ problems. Yes, it’s true that the telecom industry has faced heavy costs to roll out 5G and other new infrastructure. And competition from cable companies has pressured margins to an extent.That said, telecom firms still retain their defensive traits. They offer gushers of cash flow and are recession-proof; people will keep paying the phone bill regardless of what is going on in the broader economy. VZ stock has fallen 25 percent over the past year. That’s a remarkable amount for a firm that is typically such a low-volatility stock. And with shares at today’s price, Verizon goes for just 8 times forward earnings while offering a 6.9% dividend yield.Value Stocks to Buy: Advance Auto Parts (AAP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comThe used automobile industry had an incredible couple of years. In 2021 and 2022, used car prices went up sharply. In fact, cars were an appreciating asset during the pandemic, which is in stark contrast to the usual rapid depreciation seen for aging vehicles.This came about due to the shortage of semiconductors and other inputs needed to manufacture new cars. In this environment, people were willing to spend more on used vehicle repair and maintenance, and it led to great times for car parts retailers. This period has now ended, and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) stock took a hit because of it. Shares are down a shocking 46% over the past year. And yet, operating results aren’t anywhere near bad enough to justify that fact. Indeed, in the most recent earnings report, Advanced Auto Parts topped earnings expectations while growing revenues by 3% year-over-year.These aren’t amazing results by any means, but hardly the ones you’d expect from a company that has lost nearly half its value, either. At the current price, AAP stock goes for just 10 times forward earnings while giving off a generous 5.17% dividend yield.Global Payments (GPN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) is a merchant acquirer company focused on small to mid-sized merchants. Merchant acquirers function as an intermediary between retailers and credit card companies, offering payment terminals, back office support, software, fraud prevention services, and so on needed to ensure swift and seamless transactions.Global Payments made a huge move a few years ago completing a merger of equals with Total System Services. This gave Global Payments the size and scale to compete with the largest firms in the industry. However, the benefits of this merger got lost amid a huge downturn in the payments industry. As rivals like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have seen their share prices collapse, investors have sold off GPN stock as well.But that’s a mistake. Global Payments has a track record of double-digit annualized earnings and revenue growth and it continues to post healthy numbers now. To that point, the stock now sells for less than 10 times forward earnings and analysts continue to expect double-digit earnings growth in 2023 and beyond. Even with all the problems other weaker peers are having within the industry, Global Payments is simply too cheap to make sense.Tyson Foods (TSN)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is a leading food company whose main product lines include beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods. Tyson is a commodity producer, meaning that most of its product sales are tied to cyclical market prices rather than having much pricing power. That’s a negative for Tyson compared to other packaged foods companies. However, TSN stock has sold off 34% over the past year. This more than makes up for the lower margins inherent in Tyson’s business model.Why have shares dropped so far? That’s related to high animal prices, which are in turn driven by high grain prices which resulted in part from the war in Ukraine. Fortunately for Tyson and for meat eaters more generally, this inflationary problem won’t last forever. Farmers and ranchers address higher prices by raising more crops and cattle which will normalize market conditions in due time.In the meanwhile, investors can get a bargain in TSN stock today. Even with earnings in a dip, shares are still going for just 13 times this year’s estimates. Tyson stock traded for nearly $100 per share in both 2019 and 2022, making today’s sub-$60 level an attractive one for investors with the patience to wait for a few quarters as the meat cycle resolves itself.BP (BP)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comMany investors have written off BP (NYSE:BP) after its years in the wilderness. Between the Deepwater Horizon disaster and BP’s rushed and poorly executed transition into the renewable energy space, BP stock has certainly failed to keep up with peers in recent years. However, it’s time to give BP stock a second look. That’s because the firm’s CEO, Bernard Looney, announced earlier this year that BP will be trimming its renewable energy investments while focusing more on traditional oil and gas. This should be just what BP investors were looking for. After all, the firm’s core energy assets remain highly profitable. To that point, shares are trading for less than 6x forward earnings at the moment.Now that BP will spend less of those earnings on green energy while returning more to shareholders, BP can become a true gusher of profits once again. Shares yield 4.4% and there should be a sizable share buyback program adding to appeal as well.Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comSociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is one of the world’s largest lithium companies. Hailing from Chile, it operates in one of the more stable and reliable low-cost mining countries in the world. Lithium is a promising metal going forward. As the world continues to adopt electric vehicles and other high-intensity battery applications, the demand for lithium should skyrocket.Major vehicle makers such as Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) have started trying to acquire their own lithium supplies to ensure against potential shortages. This gives investors a sense of the strategic importance of lithium supplies in the coming years. And SQM has tremendous reserves and current production capabilities.SQM is also highly profitable. Shares are going for less than 7 times forward earnings while offering a 9% dividend yield. Shares have dipped thanks to fears of an economic slowdown. And while that is a legitimate risk for 2023, over the longer haul, lithium should remain in high demand.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BP, GPN, VZ, and GS stock.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in American International Group (NYSE:AIG). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide American International Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for American International Group How Fast Is American International Group Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. American International Group's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 55%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens. EPS growth figures have also been helped by share buybacks, showing the market that the company is in a position of financial strength, allowing it to return capital to shareholders.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that American International Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The good news is that American International Group is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.6 percentage points to 29%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of American International Group's forecast profits?Are American International Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$37b company like American International Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$78m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Is American International Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?American International Group's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching American International Group very closely. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with American International Group.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

ABT recently announced the receipt of the FDA approval for the company's Epic Max stented tissue valve to treat people with aortic regurgitation or stenosis. The new valve is intended to preserve and simplify future options for patients to manage their heart valve disease.The latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly boost Abbott’s structural heart business of the broader Medical Devices segment.About Epic Max Tissue ValveEpic Max is developed to achieve excellent hemodynamics or blood flow. Its low-profile frame enables potential future transcatheter interventions for patients. This new valve is built on the Epic surgical valve platform, utilizing its long-term performance and durability. This device is the newest addition to Abbott's Epic surgical valve platform, which has trusted safety and strong clinical outcomes, with an optimized design to enhance valve blood flow.Benefits of Epic Max Tissue ValveThe aortic valve is one of the heart valves most commonly impacted by cardiovascular disease, frequently requiring replacement. Per management, Abbott's Epic Max design optimizes blood flow for patients and has a low profile that makes future cardiac interventions simpler.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt is worth mentioning that when the aortic valve doesn't close properly or fails to fully open, the heart doesn’t pump blood efficiently and flow to the body is reduced. If left untreated, aortic valve disease can lead to heart failure, stroke, blood clots or death. Bioprosthetic valves like Epic Max are suggested for patients who require valve replacement and aren't suitable for taking blood-thinning medication.Progress Within Structural Heart SpaceThis month, Abbott announced favorable findings on remote pressure monitoring. This study result was presented at the Technology and Heart Failure Therapeutics Conference in Boston, MA. The data revealed that monitoring patients remotely with hemodynamic pressure sensing technology can significantly improve the survival rate of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).Story continuesThe same month, Abbott announced significant progress with Navitor, the company’s latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system. The company announced late-breaking data for Navitor during presentations at the annual Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) meeting held in Washington, D.C. (Feb 25-28, 2023).Results from this study supported Navitor's recent FDA approval to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global TAVI market was valued at $4,559 million in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $16,937 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 14%. Factors like the increase in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, rise in demand for various TAVI procedures and rise in the elderly population are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is expected to strengthen Abbott's global structural heart business.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 4.2% in a year against the industry’s fall of 9.6%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance, along with the acquisition of dialysis centers, is expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding the dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 30.5% compared with the 20.1% decline of the industry and an 11.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $7.18 billion. The company projects 8.4% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, the average surprise being 2.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Dec 31, 2022, the company had approximately 42,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing $3.5 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses, which own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary services, is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.As of Dec 31, 2022, DaVita provided dialysis services at 3,074 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,724 were U.S. centers, while 350 were located across 11 other countries. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company opened six dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired three and opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: DaVita’s solid fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its Other revenues during the period. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and the opening of others, within the United States and overseas, were also recorded.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 8.2% south to $5.93.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.83 billion, suggesting a 0.4% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our first-quarter revenue estimate of $2.83 billion, which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

And Paramount Global (PARA) says investment in its streaming service Paramount+ is at a high — meaning that investors can expect it will spend less in the future.All of that could bode well for profitability, which is increasingly a focus for investors. The stock market wiped a whopping $500 billion-plus in market capitalization from the world's biggest media, cable, and entertainment giants in 2022. Meantime, interest rates have gone up, making borrowing more expensive.“As we now painfully know, money is no longer cheap,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said in a recent note. ""Wall Street’s attitude towards streaming has now largely reversed course as more skeptics raise the question of whether streaming is a good business (a question we have long been asking). In turn, companies are no longer willing to spend whatever it takes, in part because attitudes and strategies have shifted and rationalized, but also because their balance sheets no longer have what it takes.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.'Peak losses' in sight? Comcast's fledgling streaming service Peacock saw its operating loss increase 47% to $2.5 billion in 2022 from the prior year, the company revealed in its latest earnings report. Comcast president Michael Cavanagh told investors on the earnings call in January, ""We believe 2023 will be peak losses for Peacock and from there, steadily improve."" He estimated losses will total about $3 billion this year.""We spend quite a bit of money creating content so migrating some of that content as eyeballs move to a more streaming universe — we like what we're doing,"" Cavanagh said. ""We think Peacock is absolutely the right strategy for our company.""Meanwhile, Disney's direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022 ended on Oct. 1, after it spent an estimated $33 billion on content last year. On the company's earnings call in November, Disney's CFO Christine McCarthy said that ""peak losses are now behind us.""Story continuesOther companies have emphasized that they are cutting costs. Paramount Global (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish said in February that “we are at peak investment in 2023” in Paramount+.Paramount reported a direct-to-consumer loss of roughly $1.82 billion in 2022 — slightly above previous guidance of $1.8 billion.Streaming-facing companies grappled with heavy losses last year — but media executives, like Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish, have preached brighter days are aheadAnd Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has dealt with a slew of merger-induced challenges, reported a direct-to-consumer loss of $217 million in the fourth quarter — a $511 million improvement over last year. CEO David Zaslav told investors during the company's Q4 earnings call, ""The bulk of our restructuring is behind us. ...We are one company now.""The embattled media giant also announced it will be raising its $3.5 billion cost-savings target to $4 billion over the next two years.Strategy shifts &amp; restructuring playsExpectations that streaming losses will ease come amid a backdrop of cost-cutting in the industry.As media executives look to pare losses and cut down on costs, many have committed to sizable restructuring efforts — like Disney, which reorganized the business into three separate units and recently began the process of laying off 7,000 workers in an effort to slash $5.5 billion in costs.In his prepared remarks during the company's first quarter earnings report on Feb. 8, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the new strategic organization, ""will result in a more cost-effective coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations, and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment.""Iger has also hinted Hulu could be on the chopping block as the deadline approaches for Disney to buy out Comcast's 33% stake in the streaming business.""I’ve talked about general entertainment being undifferentiated. I'm not going to speculate if we're a buyer or a seller of it,"" Iger said during an interview with CNBC last month. ""But I'm concerned about undifferentiated general entertainment. We're going to look at it very objectively.""The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attends the Nominees Luncheon for the 95th Oscars in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniParamount has also taken steps to restructure its business, unveiling a reorganization that combines Showtime with MTV Entertainment Studios. The move comes after the company announced it will be merging its Paramount+ and Showtime streaming services into one offering dubbed ""Paramount+ with Showtime.""As a result, Paramount said it will take a content impairment charge between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, but expects $700 million in future annual savings.More price hikes, revenue initiativesPrice hikes and other profitability measures, such as ad-supported tiers and password-sharing crackdowns, have also emerged as top priorities for 2023.Disney's Iger admitted the company was ""off"" on pricing for its Disney+ streaming service, suggesting there's room to raise prices after it debuted an ad-supported offering late last year. Current Disney+ pricing stands at $7.99 for the ad tier and $10.99 for the ad-free version.Paramount, meanwhile, said price hikes will come later this year in an effort to stem losses. The new monthly price for the premium Paramount+/Showtime tier will jump to $11.99 — up from $9.99. The essential Paramount+ tier with ads will rise by just $1 to $5.99.""Paramount+ is far from the industry price leader,"" CEO Bakish said on the earnings call. ""We're on the value end of the pricing spectrum.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Although Netflix (NFLX) has not yet raised prices this year, the streamer has committed to a sweeping password sharing crackdown even as intense backlash from users builds.So far, the streamer has broadened the crackdown to include countries like Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain, in addition to the test countries like Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru. So far, there has been no announcement regarding U.S. users.Netflix has also leaned on differentiated content like live comedy specials, in addition to advertising.According to Bloomberg, Netflix's ad-supported service reached roughly 1 million monthly active users in the U.S. after its second month on the market—bucking earlier reports the ad tier was off to a slow start.Alexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Overall, the S&amp;P 500 finished the first quarter up 7% and rose for the second-straight quarter, which Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees as the start of something bigger for markets.Former President Donald Trump's indictment late Thursday also didn't move markets, but will be carefully watched for implications on the looming debt ceiling debate this summer and 2024 election, pros say.""At this point, the view that Trump could benefit from his legal troubles has almost become conventional wisdom, to the extent that 'actually it is bad to be indicted' is now a contrarian take,"" said Evercore ISI strategist Tobin Marcus.""But we have been making this argument since last summer, and we still believe it. We maintain our view that Trump is a strong frontrunner for the GOP nomination.""But with first quarter earnings season right around the corner and the start of the second quarter coming up on Monday, let's set 2024 aside for now and go through a few other key items that caught Yahoo Finance's attention this week.1. Foot Locker runs into its futureSome seven months into the CEO job at Foot Locker (FL), Mary Dillon told me at Shoptalk in Las Vegas this week she is trying to ensure the company is around for the next 50 years to serve sneakerheads.""We are the OG of sneakers and are really refocusing on all things sneakers,"" Dillon said.The Foot Locker store in Broomfield, Colorado is seen November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Rick WilkingDillon has wasted no time in outlining her goals to Wall Street and repairing a damaged relationship with Nike (NKE), as we noted earlier this week. Given Dillon's impressive eight-year track track record as CEO of Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker investors should rest assured they have a top flight leader.Story continuesYou can read more on what we learned at Shoptalk here.Stat Share: Foot Locker shares are up 8% since Dillon was announced as CEO in late August 2022, out-performing the S&amp;P 500's 2.1% drop.2. Lyft hails a new CEOAfter a series of bad quarters amid market share losses to larger rival Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) has ordered a new leader for its corner office.With the stock down 77% in the past year, the move to replace co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer operationally at least wasn't a total shock to Wall Street (both will stay on the board).Enter Amazon- and Microsoft-trained David Risher, who has also been a Lyft board member for about 18 months. Risher told Yahoo Finance Live he is focused on getting back to basics at Lyft, which may include further expense cuts.Risher also didn't rule out a sale of Lyft at some point.""We always look at options and people approach us from time to time. Right now our focus is on creating such a great service that in whatever configuration, we are going to be relevant — valuable — either as a standalone company or something else,"" Risher said.Stat Share: Lyft investors will have to wait to for Risher's operational magic honed at Amazon and Microsoft — he doesn't officially start as Lyft's CEO until April 17.3. FAANG shows its teeth, finallyOmnipresent tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush tells me big-cap tech stocks are the new safety trade among investors seeking shelter during the bank crisis. He looks to be on the mark, at the moment.The first quarter saw the return of rabid buying interest in the FAANG complex — more formally known as Meta Platforms (META) (née Facebook), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOGL) (née Google). The best-performing FAANG stock in the quarter was Meta, which saw shares rise more than 70% as investors warmed up to the profit potential this year from major cost-cuts.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The worst-performing FAANG stock in the quarter was Netflix, which rose a mere 15% with some subscriber unhappiness fueled by a password crackdown reports Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal.

Netflix has typically far outpaced its peers in Hollywood in terms of annual movie output, churning out around 50 pictures per year.As part of the restructuring, the group will bring together its divisions that make small and medium-sized feature-length projects, Bloomberg reported. The move will result in some layoffs, as well as the departure of long-time executives.Decision-making inside the company will now be more centralized, Bloomberg said, as Stuber looks to encourage more top-level collaboration. Previously, Netflix went on a hiring spree to staff several relatively-autonomous segments that were tasked with producing movies with small-, medium- and large-range budgets.The changes come after Netflix axed hundreds of jobs last year in an effort to offset slowing subscriber growth through cost cuts. It has also offered customers a cheaper streaming plan with advertising and cracked down on account sharing between users, all in a bid to boost revenues.Related ArticlesNetflix to rein in movie output, slash jobs in restructuring push - BloombergUS Justice Dept sues Norfolk Southern over Ohio train derailmentNestle sees price pressures easing -chairman tells newspaper]"

103,f92e9f05-83ad-3b6f-b390-3b5f63052031,NEM,2023-04-01,3 Gold Stocks to Buy for Dividend Growth,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-gold-stocks-buy-dividend-104517451.html,1680086717,STORY,"['GC=F', 'GOLD', 'NEM', 'KGC']","[Gold has been among the performing asset classes in the first quarter of 2023. The precious metal trades above $1,950 an ounce and looks strong for further gains in the coming quarters. With the upside in gold, investors can look at some attractive gold stocks to buy.Before talking about gold mining stocks, let’s briefly discuss the reasons to remain bullish on gold. The crisis in the financial sector is a major reason, as investors seek refuge in safe assets. Inflation has been stubborn, and a recession seems likely. All these factors support the bull thesis for gold.I also believe that central bankers might shift to expansionary policies if there is a deep recession. This scenario seems likely in the second half of 2023. Expansionary policies would imply a weak dollar and a rally for gold and other asset classes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s therefore a good time to consider exposure to gold stocks that are trading at attractive levels. These stocks are poised for a meaningful rally and I also expect healthy dividend growth in 2023.Let’s take a deeper look into these gold stocks to buy.NEMNewmont Corporation$48.64GOLDBarrick Gold$18.72KGCKinross Gold$4.57Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockWith the recent upside in gold, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is higher by 19% in the last six months. NEM stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 22.8 and offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.Newmont has an investment grade balance sheet and ended 2022, with a total liquidity buffer of $6.7 billion. Last year, the company delivered free cash flow of $1.1 billion. If gold trades near $2,000 an ounce, I believe FCF is likely to be around $2 billion. Therefore, Newmont has headroom for healthy dividend growth in 2023.Looking beyond this year, Newmont has a robust asset base with 96 million ounces in proved reserves. The company expects to sustain stable production through 2040s.Story continuesAssuming a scenario where gold remains in an uptrend, the company is a cash flow machine. Further, Newmont expects to lower all-in-sustaining-cost in the coming years. Even with sideways gold price, the company will be positioned to report healthier EBITDA margin.Barrick Gold (GOLD)How to Play Barrick Gold Stock Ahead of Today's EarningsSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) stock is another quality name among gold stocks to buy for 2023. The stock has been in an uptrend in the last six months and offers a dividend yield of 2.2%.As an overview, the company currently has six tier one gold assets with a reserve base of 72 million ounces. A robust asset base provides clear cash flow visibility for the long term.Last year, Barrick Gold reported $3.48 billion in operating cash flows. For the current year, I expect OCF in excess of $5 billion if gold remains above $1,900 an ounce. The company is therefore positioned to increase shareholder rewards.An important point to note is that Barrick Gold has guided for an all-in-sustaining-cost of $1,170 to $1,250 an ounce for 2023. If the AISC remains around these levels with gold trending higher, significant margin expansion is likely in the coming years. GOLD stock is therefore attractive even beyond 2023 and, with a strong balance sheet, share buyback is also likely to remain aggressive.Kinross Gold (KGC)Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAmong smaller names in the gold mining industry, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) looks attractive.KGC stock has trended higher by 34% in the last six months and offers a dividend yield of 2.7%. At a forward P/E of 17.3, the stock remains undervalued.In terms of business fundamentals, there are two important points to note. First, Kinross ended 2022 with a strong liquidity buffer of $1.8 billion. Further, the company reported free cash flow of $157 million for Q4 2022. Considering the upside in gold price, Kinross is positioned to deliver FCF over $700 million for 2023.Another key point is that even with some asset sale in 2022, Kinross has a stable production visibility through 2025. With cash flow upside coupled with production visibility, Kinross is positioned to increase dividends and pursue share repurchase.I would also not be surprised if the company pursues inorganic growth. This will compensate for the sale of Russian assets for geopolitical reasons.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Freeport LNG shut in June 2022 after a fire. The quarterly price drop came on rising output and mostly mild weather so far this winter that kept heating demand low and allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage than usual. Front-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) rose 11.2 cents, or 5.3%, to settle at $2.216 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest close since March 24. Despite Friday's gain, the front-month was flat for the week, down 19% for the month and 50% for the quarter. That would be the contract's biggest quarterly drop on record, topping the current record loss of 49% during the first quarter of 2001. The market has been extremely volatile this month, with the front-month gaining or losing more than 5% on 11 of the past 23 trading days. With gas market volatility rising in recent weeks, open interest in gas futures on the NYMEX rose to 1.32 million contracts on Thursday, the highest since October 2021. Open interest in the front-month contract alone rose to over 380,200 contracts on Thursday, the most since March 2020. Freeport LNG's export plant was on track to pull in about 2.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas on Friday, up from 1.5 bcfd on Thursday, according to data provider Refinitiv. Energy traders said that was a sure sign that Freeport LNG was back near full power since the plant can turn about 2.1 bcfd of gas into LNG for export when operating at full power. Another U.S. LNG company, Venture Global LNG, meanwhile, told federal energy regulators this week that it would continue to work on its 1.6-bcfd Calcasieu Pass export plant in Louisiana before it enters full commercial operations. Analysts, however, noted the work at Calcasieu will likely not have much impact on total U.S. LNG exports since the plant was already conducting some of the work and gas flows have averaged about 1.4 bcfd so far in March. Total gas flows to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants, including Freeport LNG and Calcasieu, rose to an average of 13.2 bcfd so far in March, up from 12.8 bcfd in February. That would top the monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022, before Freeport LNG shut. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 98.6 bcfd so far in March, up from 98.1 bcfd in February. The monthly record is 99.9 bcfd in November 2022. Meteorologists projected the weather in the Lower 48 states would remain mostly near normal through April 13. With warmer spring-like weather expected to keep reducing the amount of gas burned to heat homes and businesses, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would drop from 110.6 bcfd this week to 104.1 bcfd next week and 103.8 bcfd in two weeks. The forecast for next week was higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday. Mild winter weather allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage so far this year and should let them start injecting fuel into inventories at the beginning of April. Gas stockpiles were about 21% above their five-year average (2018-2022) during the week ended March 24 and were expected to end about 20% above normal during the colder-than-normal week ended March 31, according to federal data and analysts' estimates.

Worst was the quarter, where it tumbled 50%.The selloff in gas came amid weaker-than-usual demand for heating that has left 1.853 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, of gas in U.S. storage, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said in its latest inventory reading for the week ended March 24.The current U.S. gas storage is 31% higher from the balance at the same time a year ago and 21% up versus the five-year average for storage, the EIA said.The gas balance for 2023 is the highest in recent memory and remains the bane of bulls in the market who’ve been trying to restart a spectacular rally they enjoyed just months ago, before an unusually warm winter season led to less heating demand, sending excess gas supply into storage.The path forward for gas bulls would be to hope for outsized summer demand that would lead to higher-than-usual storage draws of the fuel for cooling, said analysts.Barring a scorching and long summer, “we still need a decent supply move downward this summer to facilitate balancing this market,” Eric McGuire, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in comments carried by naturalgasintel.com.Related ArticlesNatural gas posts worst quarterly drop of 50%; Bulls count on summer demand nextOil has good week but poor month; Even poorer quarterGold up 9% for 2 quarters in row as safe haven and risk both shine]"

The company had put the mine under care and maintenance in August 2018.The total consideration of $35 million consists of 69,063,076 Sierra Madre shares. First Majestic now holds approximately 48.4% of Sierra Madre's issued and outstanding common shares.In December 2022, First Majestic Silver announced an agreement to sell its fully-owned past-producing La Parrilla Silver Mine in Durango, Mexico to Golden Tag Resources Ltd. for $33.5 million. The silver, gold, lead and zinc operation had been placed under care and maintenance by AG in September 2019.First Majestic will receive 143,673,684 shares in Golden Tag shares for a total value of $20 million. This represents approximately 40% of the outstanding shares in Golden Tag. Per the deal, AG will also receive up to $13.5 million as three milestone payments in either cash or shares in Golden Tag.First Majestic currently owns the San Dimas Silver/Gold Mine, the Santa Elena Silver/Gold Mine, the La Encantada Silver Mine and the Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine. The company recently announced its decision to temporarily suspend all mining operations and lower its workforce at Jerritt Canyon Mine (which generated about 21% of AG's 2022 revenues). This is due to several ongoing challenges, including inflationary cost pressures, contractor inefficiencies, lower-than-expected head grades and multiple extreme weather events. The decision is in sync with the company’s aim to produce profitable ounces across all businesses.Since acquiring the Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine in 2021, AG has attempted to raise underground mining rates to sustainably feed the processing plant at a minimum of 3,000 tons per day in order to generate a free cash flow. However, mining rates remained below the target, while cash costs per ounce remained higher than anticipated. This was mainly driven by ongoing challenges like contractor inefficiencies and high costs, inflationary cost pressures and extreme weather conditions in northern Nevada.Even though mining operations are being ceased, effective immediately, the remaining surface stockpiles will be processed over the next few months. First Majestic will keep exploring near-mine and potential regional greenfield targets to expand Jerritt Canyon's resources and potentially improve the economics for the eventual restart of operations. The company expects to continue exploration activities throughout 2023.During the suspension, First Majestic intends to explore new regional finds and increase known reserves and resources. It plans to further analyze the optimization of bulk mining and cost-effective mining techniques.In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported an adjusted loss per share of 7 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents, mainly due to lower prices. Revenues plunged 28% year over year to $148 million in the quarter.Shares of the company have fallen 46.9% in the past year compared with the industry's 27.7% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderFirst Majestic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Olympic Steel, Inc.  ZEUS, Steel Dynamics, Inc.

Freeport LNG exited that outage in February and returned to near full power this week.Total gas flows to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose to an average of 13.2 bcfd so far in March, up from 12.8 bcfd in February. That would top the monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022, before Freeport LNG shut.The seven big U.S. LNG export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.Venture Global said Calcasieu had ""failures in the five horizontal heat recovery steam generator (HRSGs) units that facilitate combined-cycle power generation.""The company said employees ""observed water loss from HRSG units 2 and 3"" due to ""leaks in the welds between the upper carbon steel header and finned tubes of the HRSG units.""Venture Global asked the supplier, General Electric Co , ""to investigate the cause of the leaks"" and noted the ""units will require extensive repairs and replacements before the power island can function reliably.""Venture Global said it would provide updates in the future on the timing of the repairs and start of commercial operations.

If you want to see more best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years, go directly to 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years.There are different definitions for growth stocks. For this article, we define high growth as a stock with an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10%.Considering a stock can have a high EPS next 5 year ratio by starting off with a small profit base, the best growth stocks also have other compelling characteristics such as competitive advantages, long term growth potential, and ideally a history of profitability. For those of you interested, check out 12 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable.In terms of the next 5 years, one of the biggest growth sectors will likely be AI given how transformative the technology could be.According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI alone could eventually increase global GDP by 7%. Specifically, analysts at the investment bank said, ""The boost to global labor productivity could also be economically significant, and we estimate that AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%"" although the exact timing and the exact effect size could be difficult to estimate according to the analysts.To put the 7% number into perspective, global GDP was $96.53 trillion in 2021 according to The World Bank. According to Statista, the global economy had a GDP of $101.6 trillion in 2022, the first time it surpassed $100 trillion. 7% of $101.6 trillion would be $7.11 trillion, larger than the nominal GDP of Japan. For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.While the vast majority of the increase in global GDP will benefit various firms throughout the global economy by allowing them to create more goods and services, the leading tech companies that have invested tens of billions into AI and that have one of the three largest cloud computing businesses could also benefit from more demand as well.Story continuesGiven how fast the AI sector is developing, it is very difficult to pick exact stocks that will do well. One company can lag behind others for a variety of reasons. If the sector is winner take all, there could really only be one or a few companies that do well.Given the sector is so uncertain, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Computer, memory, processorPhoto by Liam Briese on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years, we chose 12 stocks with competitive advantages that have an EPS next 5 year ratios of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We also included Amazon.com, Inc.

Between the global push toward net zero and a renewed focus on energy security, the energy transition is exactly that. The war in Ukraine’s had a huge impact on the way the world sees energy. With Russian supplies now off the table, there’s been somewhat of a backslide to new oil and gas drilling projects. While this will set us back in the race to net zero, uncertainty in the energy market has also driven policymakers to plough money in to alternative energy supplies in an effort to diversify. That means cleaner technology like wind, solar and hydrogen are seeing their growth runways expand considerably.The United States’ landmark Inflation Reduction Act offered generous tax cuts to renewables providers in a bid to spur on innovation in the sector. It made it much more attractive to be a clean energy provider operating in the U.S. Not to be outdone, the E.U.’s offering up its own support package in a bid to hold on to the industry and keep it growing on its own soil. With these two heavyweights fighting tooth and nail to lure clean energy operators into their back yards, it should be clear that this is an industry with growth ahead.We’re still a ways off from hitting net zero, and a lot can happen over the next 20 years. But the energy transition will be one of the biggest shifts in our lifetime, and the best ESG stocks could be the next Amazons and Apples.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAir Products (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comHydrogen is a key part of the transition to cleaner energy. If we’re going to get to net zero by 2050 as planned, it will need to make up about 10% of the global energy mix —that’s a huge jump from the 0.1% it accounts for today. So the opportunity for growth here is massive. One of the best ESG stocks to consider here is Air Products (NYSE:APD). It is in the process of building out America’s largest green hydrogen facility and it has a few other low-carbon hydrogen projects dotted in other parts of the word. For now it’s only a small, unprofitable part of the business, though it should yield some appealing tax breaks. Story continuesThis part of Air Product’s business is its future — but the present looks pretty good as well. The group supplies industrial gas, which is a relatively insulated place to be. Customers tend to be pretty reliable with long-term contracts. Profitability looks set to improve as well following a cost cutting program that’s expected to bring operating margins in to the low 20%range.A solid business like this doesn’t come cheap, though. Shares change hands for 28 times earnings. Still with all of the potential ahead, Air Products looks like a good bet on a sustainable future. NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra (NYSE:NEE) is a utility company that both makes and distributes energy throughout Florida. On the production side you have NextEra Energy Resources (NEER). Most of the energy this part of the business produces comes from renewable sources, making it one of the world’s largest wind and solar generators. But what makes NextEra one of the best ESG stocks for investors looking to capitalize on the shift toward sustainability is the fact that NEER is responsible for about 40% of underlying profits. So it’s a meaningful part of the business.The distribution side, Florida Power and Light, is responsible for the rest. Most of the energy it distributes comes from natural gas — which is cleaner than things like coal and oil, but still a fossil fuel.

The French company offers energy management solutions for businesses around the world and it is one of the best ESG stocks for investors looking for a pure play on the transition. What sets it apart is their commitment to making the world a little bit greener. Clean energy isn’t just a meaningful part of the business — it’s almost the whole thing. At last check, revenue supporting things like the circular economy and decarbonization, dubbed “impact revenue,” made up almost three-quarters of the total. That’s expected to rise to 80% by 2025. A lot of that income is dropping through to profits — underlying margins were over 17% last year. That’s expected to continue growing in the year ahead as well. The kind of growth Schneider has on offer comes at a premium price tag, with shares trading at around 25 times earnings. However for investors that want a pure-play on sustainable energy, Schneider Electric stock is one of the best picks around. On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The good news is that volatility created many solid value stocks to buy. And, after all, a highly profitable firm bought at a sufficiently low price should reward investors with a solid margin of safety and the potential for well above-average returns. In fact, these seven value stocks to buy, in particular, have promising outlooks for the rest of 2023. And, as of this writing, all are selling for less than 15 times forward earnings meaning they are selling at valuations much below the S&amp;P 500 as a whole.GSGoldman Sachs$316.57VZVerizon$38.02AAPAdvance Auto Parts$116.01GPNGlobal Payments$98.95TSNTyson Foods$57.85BPBP.$37.38SQMSociedad Química y Minera de Chile$82.02Value Stocks to Buy: Goldman Sachs (GS)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comBank stocks were slammed over the past month. And with understandable reason. Several prominent banks failed, and more are struggling to adapt to the rapidly-changing interest rate environment.That said, investors shouldn’t give up on the whole sector. Banks are often among the best value stocks to buy, and the current industry consolidation will favor the industry leaders. That includes Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman is known for its skilled trading. The firm made profits in the 2008 financial crisis betting against failing mortgages, for example, while most other banks were caught horribly on the wrong side of the market. Goldman, with its world-class trading team and institutional banking chops, is in a great position to ride out the current volatility and make the most of shifting market opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsShares have pulled back nearly 15% from their recent highs. This puts GS stock at less than 10 times forward earnings. It also trades at just 1.0x book value which has been an excellent entry point for Goldman Sachs shares historically. While weak banks may continue to flounder, leaders like Goldman Sachs are set to take advantage and the current price marks a value opportunity.Story continuesValue Stocks to Buy: Verizon (VZ)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockTelecom stocks are usually viewed as stable blue-chip stocks. Unfortunately, the past year damaged that idea. Rival AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) slashed its dividend following some ill-advised acquisitions which left it in an excessive amount of debt. However, I believe investors unfairly punished Verizon (NYSE:VZ) for other firms’ problems. Yes, it’s true that the telecom industry has faced heavy costs to roll out 5G and other new infrastructure. And competition from cable companies has pressured margins to an extent.That said, telecom firms still retain their defensive traits. They offer gushers of cash flow and are recession-proof; people will keep paying the phone bill regardless of what is going on in the broader economy. VZ stock has fallen 25 percent over the past year. That’s a remarkable amount for a firm that is typically such a low-volatility stock. And with shares at today’s price, Verizon goes for just 8 times forward earnings while offering a 6.9% dividend yield.Value Stocks to Buy: Advance Auto Parts (AAP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comThe used automobile industry had an incredible couple of years. In 2021 and 2022, used car prices went up sharply. In fact, cars were an appreciating asset during the pandemic, which is in stark contrast to the usual rapid depreciation seen for aging vehicles.This came about due to the shortage of semiconductors and other inputs needed to manufacture new cars. In this environment, people were willing to spend more on used vehicle repair and maintenance, and it led to great times for car parts retailers. This period has now ended, and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) stock took a hit because of it. Shares are down a shocking 46% over the past year. And yet, operating results aren’t anywhere near bad enough to justify that fact. Indeed, in the most recent earnings report, Advanced Auto Parts topped earnings expectations while growing revenues by 3% year-over-year.These aren’t amazing results by any means, but hardly the ones you’d expect from a company that has lost nearly half its value, either. At the current price, AAP stock goes for just 10 times forward earnings while giving off a generous 5.17% dividend yield.Global Payments (GPN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) is a merchant acquirer company focused on small to mid-sized merchants. Merchant acquirers function as an intermediary between retailers and credit card companies, offering payment terminals, back office support, software, fraud prevention services, and so on needed to ensure swift and seamless transactions.Global Payments made a huge move a few years ago completing a merger of equals with Total System Services. This gave Global Payments the size and scale to compete with the largest firms in the industry. However, the benefits of this merger got lost amid a huge downturn in the payments industry. As rivals like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have seen their share prices collapse, investors have sold off GPN stock as well.But that’s a mistake. Global Payments has a track record of double-digit annualized earnings and revenue growth and it continues to post healthy numbers now. To that point, the stock now sells for less than 10 times forward earnings and analysts continue to expect double-digit earnings growth in 2023 and beyond. Even with all the problems other weaker peers are having within the industry, Global Payments is simply too cheap to make sense.Tyson Foods (TSN)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is a leading food company whose main product lines include beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods. Tyson is a commodity producer, meaning that most of its product sales are tied to cyclical market prices rather than having much pricing power. That’s a negative for Tyson compared to other packaged foods companies. However, TSN stock has sold off 34% over the past year. This more than makes up for the lower margins inherent in Tyson’s business model.Why have shares dropped so far? That’s related to high animal prices, which are in turn driven by high grain prices which resulted in part from the war in Ukraine. Fortunately for Tyson and for meat eaters more generally, this inflationary problem won’t last forever. Farmers and ranchers address higher prices by raising more crops and cattle which will normalize market conditions in due time.In the meanwhile, investors can get a bargain in TSN stock today. Even with earnings in a dip, shares are still going for just 13 times this year’s estimates. Tyson stock traded for nearly $100 per share in both 2019 and 2022, making today’s sub-$60 level an attractive one for investors with the patience to wait for a few quarters as the meat cycle resolves itself.BP (BP)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comMany investors have written off BP (NYSE:BP) after its years in the wilderness. Between the Deepwater Horizon disaster and BP’s rushed and poorly executed transition into the renewable energy space, BP stock has certainly failed to keep up with peers in recent years. However, it’s time to give BP stock a second look. That’s because the firm’s CEO, Bernard Looney, announced earlier this year that BP will be trimming its renewable energy investments while focusing more on traditional oil and gas. This should be just what BP investors were looking for. After all, the firm’s core energy assets remain highly profitable. To that point, shares are trading for less than 6x forward earnings at the moment.Now that BP will spend less of those earnings on green energy while returning more to shareholders, BP can become a true gusher of profits once again. Shares yield 4.4% and there should be a sizable share buyback program adding to appeal as well.Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comSociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is one of the world’s largest lithium companies. Hailing from Chile, it operates in one of the more stable and reliable low-cost mining countries in the world. Lithium is a promising metal going forward. As the world continues to adopt electric vehicles and other high-intensity battery applications, the demand for lithium should skyrocket.Major vehicle makers such as Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) have started trying to acquire their own lithium supplies to ensure against potential shortages. This gives investors a sense of the strategic importance of lithium supplies in the coming years. And SQM has tremendous reserves and current production capabilities.SQM is also highly profitable. Shares are going for less than 7 times forward earnings while offering a 9% dividend yield. Shares have dipped thanks to fears of an economic slowdown. And while that is a legitimate risk for 2023, over the longer haul, lithium should remain in high demand.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BP, GPN, VZ, and GS stock.

Freeport LNG shut in June 2022 after a fire. The quarterly price drop came on rising output and mostly mild weather so far this winter that kept heating demand low and allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage than usual. Front-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) rose 11.2 cents, or 5.3%, to settle at $2.216 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest close since March 24. Despite Friday's gain, the front-month was flat for the week, down 19% for the month and 50% for the quarter. That would be the contract's biggest quarterly drop on record, topping the current record loss of 49% during the first quarter of 2001. The market has been extremely volatile this month, with the front-month gaining or losing more than 5% on 11 of the past 23 trading days. With gas market volatility rising in recent weeks, open interest in gas futures on the NYMEX rose to 1.32 million contracts on Thursday, the highest since October 2021. Open interest in the front-month contract alone rose to over 380,200 contracts on Thursday, the most since March 2020. Freeport LNG's export plant was on track to pull in about 2.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas on Friday, up from 1.5 bcfd on Thursday, according to data provider Refinitiv. Energy traders said that was a sure sign that Freeport LNG was back near full power since the plant can turn about 2.1 bcfd of gas into LNG for export when operating at full power. Another U.S. LNG company, Venture Global LNG, meanwhile, told federal energy regulators this week that it would continue to work on its 1.6-bcfd Calcasieu Pass export plant in Louisiana before it enters full commercial operations. Analysts, however, noted the work at Calcasieu will likely not have much impact on total U.S. LNG exports since the plant was already conducting some of the work and gas flows have averaged about 1.4 bcfd so far in March. Total gas flows to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants, including Freeport LNG and Calcasieu, rose to an average of 13.2 bcfd so far in March, up from 12.8 bcfd in February. That would top the monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022, before Freeport LNG shut. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 98.6 bcfd so far in March, up from 98.1 bcfd in February. The monthly record is 99.9 bcfd in November 2022. Meteorologists projected the weather in the Lower 48 states would remain mostly near normal through April 13. With warmer spring-like weather expected to keep reducing the amount of gas burned to heat homes and businesses, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would drop from 110.6 bcfd this week to 104.1 bcfd next week and 103.8 bcfd in two weeks. The forecast for next week was higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday. Mild winter weather allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage so far this year and should let them start injecting fuel into inventories at the beginning of April. Gas stockpiles were about 21% above their five-year average (2018-2022) during the week ended March 24 and were expected to end about 20% above normal during the colder-than-normal week ended March 31, according to federal data and analysts' estimates.

Worst was the quarter, where it tumbled 50%.The selloff in gas came amid weaker-than-usual demand for heating that has left 1.853 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, of gas in U.S. storage, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said in its latest inventory reading for the week ended March 24.The current U.S. gas storage is 31% higher from the balance at the same time a year ago and 21% up versus the five-year average for storage, the EIA said.The gas balance for 2023 is the highest in recent memory and remains the bane of bulls in the market who’ve been trying to restart a spectacular rally they enjoyed just months ago, before an unusually warm winter season led to less heating demand, sending excess gas supply into storage.The path forward for gas bulls would be to hope for outsized summer demand that would lead to higher-than-usual storage draws of the fuel for cooling, said analysts.Barring a scorching and long summer, “we still need a decent supply move downward this summer to facilitate balancing this market,” Eric McGuire, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in comments carried by naturalgasintel.com.Related ArticlesNatural gas posts worst quarterly drop of 50%; Bulls count on summer demand nextOil has good week but poor month; Even poorer quarterGold up 9% for 2 quarters in row as safe haven and risk both shine]"

Per the deal, AG will also receive up to $13.5 million as three milestone payments in either cash or shares in Golden Tag.First Majestic currently owns the San Dimas Silver/Gold Mine, the Santa Elena Silver/Gold Mine, the La Encantada Silver Mine and the Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine. The company recently announced its decision to temporarily suspend all mining operations and lower its workforce at Jerritt Canyon Mine (which generated about 21% of AG's 2022 revenues). This is due to several ongoing challenges, including inflationary cost pressures, contractor inefficiencies, lower-than-expected head grades and multiple extreme weather events. The decision is in sync with the company’s aim to produce profitable ounces across all businesses.Since acquiring the Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine in 2021, AG has attempted to raise underground mining rates to sustainably feed the processing plant at a minimum of 3,000 tons per day in order to generate a free cash flow. However, mining rates remained below the target, while cash costs per ounce remained higher than anticipated. This was mainly driven by ongoing challenges like contractor inefficiencies and high costs, inflationary cost pressures and extreme weather conditions in northern Nevada.Even though mining operations are being ceased, effective immediately, the remaining surface stockpiles will be processed over the next few months. First Majestic will keep exploring near-mine and potential regional greenfield targets to expand Jerritt Canyon's resources and potentially improve the economics for the eventual restart of operations. The company expects to continue exploration activities throughout 2023.During the suspension, First Majestic intends to explore new regional finds and increase known reserves and resources. It plans to further analyze the optimization of bulk mining and cost-effective mining techniques.In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported an adjusted loss per share of 7 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents, mainly due to lower prices. Revenues plunged 28% year over year to $148 million in the quarter.Shares of the company have fallen 46.9% in the past year compared with the industry's 27.7% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderFirst Majestic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Olympic Steel, Inc.  ZEUS, Steel Dynamics, Inc.

Freeport LNG exited that outage in February and returned to near full power this week.Total gas flows to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose to an average of 13.2 bcfd so far in March, up from 12.8 bcfd in February. That would top the monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022, before Freeport LNG shut.The seven big U.S. LNG export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.Venture Global said Calcasieu had ""failures in the five horizontal heat recovery steam generator (HRSGs) units that facilitate combined-cycle power generation.""The company said employees ""observed water loss from HRSG units 2 and 3"" due to ""leaks in the welds between the upper carbon steel header and finned tubes of the HRSG units.""Venture Global asked the supplier, General Electric Co , ""to investigate the cause of the leaks"" and noted the ""units will require extensive repairs and replacements before the power island can function reliably.""Venture Global said it would provide updates in the future on the timing of the repairs and start of commercial operations.

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $179 million, the contract is projected to be completed by December 2024. The latest modification has increased the ceiling for Lockheed to offer ongoing development, installation, integration, testing, training, and delivery of Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) and Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN) for F-35 jets.The latest contract also enables Lockheed to support the ALIS-to-ODIN re-architecture endeavor with the aim to modernize ALIS in accordance with information technology and software development best practices. The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Foreign Military Sales customers and non-U.S. Department of Defense participants.The work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs, boost demand significantly.This, in turn, results in a solid contract flow from Pentagon and other U.S. allies for production and other associated support for modernizing and upgradation of the F-35 jets. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Impressively, the F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022. Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in the backlog till December 2022.Looking ahead, LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster the company’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft field.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to reap the benefits of the abovementioned market’s expansion.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT, which are also expected to gain from the global military aircraft market’s growth opportunities.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft. From fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare, it has been providing manned solutions to customers worldwide. The company has built some of the world’s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.Its Aeronautics Systems unit is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems.

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.NiSource and WEC Energy Group are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that NI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than WEC has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.NI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.79, while WEC has a forward P/E of 20.55. We also note that NI has a PEG ratio of 2.62. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.52.Another notable valuation metric for NI is its P/B ratio of 1.78. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WEC has a P/B of 2.57.Based on these metrics and many more, NI holds a Value grade of B, while WEC has a Value grade of D.Story continuesNI sticks out from WEC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that NI is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

J&amp;J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and asbestos-free.The bankruptcy strategy stumbled in January, when the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Philadelphia ruled that neither LTL nor J&amp;J had a legitimate need for bankruptcy protection because they were not in ""financial distress.""LTL asked the 3rd Circuit to delay its ruling from taking effect and give the company time to pursue a U.S. Supreme Court appeal.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Johnson &amp; Johnson in FocusHeadquartered in New Brunswick, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of -13.15% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.13 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.95%. In comparison, the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield is 2.56%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.73%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.52 is up 1.6% from last year. Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.91%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Johnson &amp; Johnson's current payout ratio is 44%, meaning it paid out 44% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for JNJ for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $10.50 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 3.45%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that JNJ is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

144,c5d1fad8-e10d-30d9-b901-870f788ed4a4,SO,2023-04-01,Vogtle 3 & 4 nuclear units take significant steps toward operations,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vogtle-3-4-nuclear-units-114500143.html,1680349500,STORY,['SO'],"[Unit 3 successfully generates electricity, connects to grid for the first timeUnit 4 Hot Functional Testing began last monthATLANTA, April 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Georgia Power announced today it has achieved another important milestone for the new nuclear units under construction at its Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 nuclear expansion project near Waynesboro, Ga. The generator at Vogtle Unit 3 has generated electricity for the first time, and the unit has successfully synchronized and connected to the electric grid. Meanwhile, at Vogtle Unit 4, nuclear operators began hot functional testing last month. Both achievements represent significant steps toward operations.""What an incredibly inspiring time to join Georgia Power as we celebrate this milestone that marks the first day of generating clean, reliable power at this new nuclear unit, which will serve our customers over the next 60 to 80 years,"" said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""I consider myself very fortunate to have worked onsite at Vogtle 1 &amp; 2 early in my career as an engineer, learning so much that I have carried with me over the years while also gaining an appreciation of the value of nuclear energy as a critical, long-term investment for our state. As we approach commercial operation for Unit 3, I know that every professional who has been involved in this project or worked at Plant Vogtle is proud of the role they have played in helping build a clean energy future for Georgia.""Connecting to the electric grid is part of ongoing startup testing for Vogtle Unit 3, and operators will continue to raise reactor power for electricity generation while performing tests at various power levels. This Unit 3 milestone follows initial criticality, reached on March 6, when operators safely started the nuclear reaction inside the reactor, generating nuclear heat to produce steam. Once all startup testing is successfully completed and the unit is available for reliable dispatch, the unit will enter commercial operation.Story continuesAt Unit 4, hot functional testing, which began last month, marks the last series of major tests underway for the new nuclear unit ahead of initial fuel load. The testing is being conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together and confirm the reactor is ready for fuel load. As part of the testing, the site team will begin running Unit 4 plant systems, without nuclear fuel in the reactor, and advance through the testing process towards reaching normal operating pressure and temperature. Nuclear operators will use the heat generated by the unit's four reactor coolant pumps to raise the temperature and pressure of plant systems to normal operating levels. Once normal operating temperature and pressure levels are achieved and sustained, the unit's main turbine will be raised to normal operating speed using steam from the plant. During these series of tests, nuclear operators will be able to exercise and validate procedures as required ahead of fuel load.The in-service date for Unit 3 is projected during May or June 2023. Vogtle Unit 4 is projected to enter service in late fourth quarter 2023 or first quarter 2024.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero emissions, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses. Southern Nuclear will operate the new units on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.About Georgia PowerGeorgia Power is the largest electric subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO), America's premier energy company.

Overall, the S&amp;P 500 finished the first quarter up 7% and rose for the second-straight quarter, which Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees as the start of something bigger for markets.Former President Donald Trump's indictment late Thursday also didn't move markets, but will be carefully watched for implications on the looming debt ceiling debate this summer and 2024 election, pros say.""At this point, the view that Trump could benefit from his legal troubles has almost become conventional wisdom, to the extent that 'actually it is bad to be indicted' is now a contrarian take,"" said Evercore ISI strategist Tobin Marcus.""But we have been making this argument since last summer, and we still believe it. We maintain our view that Trump is a strong frontrunner for the GOP nomination.""But with first quarter earnings season right around the corner and the start of the second quarter coming up on Monday, let's set 2024 aside for now and go through a few other key items that caught Yahoo Finance's attention this week.1. Foot Locker runs into its futureSome seven months into the CEO job at Foot Locker (FL), Mary Dillon told me at Shoptalk in Las Vegas this week she is trying to ensure the company is around for the next 50 years to serve sneakerheads.""We are the OG of sneakers and are really refocusing on all things sneakers,"" Dillon said.The Foot Locker store in Broomfield, Colorado is seen November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Rick Wilking (Rick Wilking / reuters)Dillon has wasted no time in outlining her goals to Wall Street and repairing a damaged relationship with Nike (NKE), as we noted earlier this week. Given Dillon's impressive eight-year track track record as CEO of Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker investors should rest assured they have a top flight leader.Story continuesYou can read more on what we learned at Shoptalk here.Stat Share: Foot Locker shares are up 8% since Dillon was announced as CEO in late August 2022, out-performing the S&amp;P 500's 2.1% drop.2. Lyft hails a new CEOAfter a series of bad quarters amid market share losses to larger rival Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) has ordered a new leader for its corner office.With the stock down 77% in the past year, the move to replace co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer operationally at least wasn't a total shock to Wall Street (both will stay on the board).Enter Amazon- and Microsoft-trained David Risher, who has also been a Lyft board member for about 18 months. Risher told Yahoo Finance Live he is focused on getting back to basics at Lyft, which may include further expense cuts.Risher also didn't rule out a sale of Lyft at some point.""We always look at options and people approach us from time to time. Right now our focus is on creating such a great service that in whatever configuration, we are going to be relevant — valuable — either as a standalone company or something else,"" Risher said.Stat Share: Lyft investors will have to wait to for Risher's operational magic honed at Amazon and Microsoft — he doesn't officially start as Lyft's CEO until April 17.3. FAANG shows its teeth, finallyOmnipresent tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush tells me big-cap tech stocks are the new safety trade among investors seeking shelter during the bank crisis. He looks to be on the mark, at the moment.The first quarter saw the return of rabid buying interest in the FAANG complex — more formally known as Meta Platforms (META) (née Facebook), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOGL) (née Google). The best-performing FAANG stock in the quarter was Meta, which saw shares rise more than 70% as investors warmed up to the profit potential this year from major cost-cuts.The worst-performing FAANG stock in the quarter was Netflix, which rose a mere 15% with some subscriber unhappiness fueled by a password crackdown reports Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Since last May, however, Netflix stock has doubled.All FAANG stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500's 7% increase in the quarter.Stat Share: All of the FAANG stocks fell by double-digit percentages in 2022, led by a 64% plunge in Meta.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The Timberland x CNSTNT:DVLPMNT Youth Design Workshop tour will launch and conclude in New York City with stops in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charlotte this spring and summer.Timberland and CNSTNT:DVLPMNT hosted their first one day workshop in New York in collaboration with youth development nonprofit Youth INC and footwear and apparel store Up NYC earlier this year. The collaboration gave 25 students the opportunity to learn about design as a potential career and introduced them to the fundamentals of footwear design, sketching, and exploring creative concepts and color first hand from design professionals at Timberland. During the event, the young creatives had the chance to design their own version of the Original Timberland® Boot. After the design session, NYC fashion and lifestyle authenticators alongside special celebrity guest Fat Joe reviewed the sketches. The leading design will be brought to life, offsite in Timberland's prototyping lab, The Shed.""There are less than 7% Black and Brown creatives in the design industry,"" said Dixon. ""We want to grow that number by introducing design as a career option early in the kids' academic journeys, so they can consider building their skills now. In the workshop environment, I can see the kids latch on quick to the joys of design and that feels good. Using the iconic Timberland boot as a launchpad for their creativity really engages them, and it is so exciting to see the heights of their imagination.""Story continuesAs part of Timberland's 50-anniversary celebration of the Original Timberland® Boot, a staple in New York and hip-hop culture, the brand has introduced its Timberland® Hip Hop Royalty Boot, designed by Dixon himself. This version of the emblematic boot has been reimagined with intricate design details that speak to and incorporate elements of Hip Hop- from a bold purple and regal gold colorway to a graffiti logo treatment to mini-microphone capping the laces and a boom box hang tag.While Black and Brown designers are under-represented in the design industry, the communities of color and Hip Hop have been instrumental in cultivating footwear culture. Timberland and Dixon plan to increase that statistic through the workshops that help students hone their creativity and open their eyes to new potential career paths. The Hip Hop Royalty Boots were designed to honor Timberland's roots and celebrate the community that has been so important to the brand's journey.Timberland, Friday, March 31, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Timberland on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: TimberlandWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/timberlandEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: TimberlandView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746997/Timberland-Supports-Communities-of-Color-and-Releases-the-Hip-Hop-Royalty-Boot-To-Commemorate-50th-Anniversary]"

Let's take a closer look at some of the best and worst performers, starting with the S&amp;P 500. So as we're looking here, we've got Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, Warner Brothers, Discovery. I thought Nvidia was an interesting one.A lot of people looking at it as a real strong AI player especially. We saw from Stacey Rasgon at Bernstein, he reiterated his outperform rating, raised his price target forecast to $300 from $265. And this really is based on this need, this expected need, for these Nvidia chips to train the AI models that are going to be running this generative AI that's clearly in demand at the moment. And we saw that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced a wide-ranging set of partnerships for the products as well. So this really does seem like a long term play that Nvidia is really capitalizing on.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and a few things within the best performers. I mean, you also look at the environment that they're waiting through right now, whether that's on still the fundamentals, not really having clear sight going ahead. You don't know when the digital advertising market is going to resume the type of spending that we had seen in 2021 or even 2020 as everybody was spending more time on their devices and everybody wanted to get some of their attention and get some of the dollars that consumers were still willing to spend to whatever extent. So there's the digital advertising market. And even with that, there is still a buoy that companies like Facebook and Google could benefit from because they're typically seen as the two behemoths, the duopoly, that's been able to drive that narrative for so long.Story continuesHowever, that is getting a little bit more different because of the type of devices that end users have in their hands on a daily basis. All that considered, though, on how we go forward from here-- semiconductors, even the rebound there, you could really kind of sum it up in some of the worst performers of last year being some of the early year best performers here in 2023. And if you look at some of the worst performers as of right now, it's the names that should have beware-- or should have-- what is the adage? Beware the ides of March, right?Banking sector probably could have benefited from that because of the turmoil that we've seen take place there. Some of the biggest decliners there, you're seeing regional banks. First Republic, of course, the most outsized there. And that has been down by about 89%, but much of that move significantly coming, of course, during March given the fallout and given some of the different stressors that have impacted and the missteps that management has made within some of the regional banks there that have resulted in the injections of cash and capital that they've needed to take on just to stay or try to stay afloat right now, too.RACHELLE AKUFO: That's true. I mean, and speaking of some of these worst performers in the S&amp;P, you also have in their Dish Network, one of the few pure streaming plays still left. And they're really trying to find its place in this market. You have Amazon, Apple, all the other sort of getting into this space. Dish Network still searching for some direction there. And even as we look at some of the best performers in the NASDAQ 100, Nvidia again making another appearance, but also Meta, Tesla, you have CGen as well. A lot of people wondering what's going to be happening with Tesla. A lot of headlines obviously surrounding Elon Musk. But we saw what their production targets look like. And apparently investors do believe that Tesla is actually going to make those.BRAD SMITH: And so what does this all come back to as well? It still comes back to the Fed-- and I know we're going to talk about this more in a second-- but it comes back to the policy pathway and the tenor that this Fed has signaled. If they have this signal and given language to the markets that perhaps the worst of the rate hiking is behind us, and now we are getting to more of a stable period where the markets can anticipate what the Fed may do without having to fight the Fed, then you're going to see a continued rally in some of the very names that have really led the way thus far in 2023. Tech stocks, most importantly, because they were some of the most battered as the Fed was initiating the end of their easy money policies as well.RACHELLE AKUFO: I mean, you have to wonder when it comes to some of these tightening conditions for small businesses, where we're going to start seeing people pulling back. It might show up. I mean, maybe you won't-- again, going for that more expensive car, if you have to sort of tighten the purse strings. And Teslas aren't cheap. That's for sure.BRAD SMITH: I have to get a car first, Rachelle, thank you.RACHELLE AKUFO: That's all right.BRAD SMITH: That MTA subway pass works real well.]"

The ruling puts the high-profile case in the hands of a jury that will determine whether Fox acted with actual malice and whether Dominion suffered any damages.The trial, to be held in Wilmington, is expected to last roughly four weeks. It is possible the parties could still settle the case. Davis heard arguments from both sides during a two-day pretrial hearing on March 21 and 22.“This case is and always has been about the First Amendment protections of the media’s absolute right to cover the news,"" Fox said in a statement. ""Fox will continue to fiercely advocate for the rights of free speech and a free press as we move into the next phase of these proceedings.”Dominion said it was gratified by the ruling and looked forward to the trial.This is one of the most closely watched U.S. defamation lawsuits in years and involves one of America's largest cable networks, home to many prominent conservative commentators.Denver-based Dominion sued New York-based Fox Corp and Fox News in 2021, accusing them of ruining its reputation by airing false claims by former President Donald Trump and his lawyers that its voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.Dominion has said in court filings that internal emails, texts and deposition testimony demonstrate that Fox personnel at every level - from producers to hosts, all the way up to Chairman Rupert Murdoch - knew the election-rigging claims were false and aired them anyway in pursuit of ratings as they lost viewers to far-right outlets that embraced Trump's claims.Story continuesDominion argued this met the ""actual malice"" standard to win a defamation case under which a plaintiff must prove a defendant knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.Davis, however, said actual malice will be determined by the jury.The judge ruled in Dominion's favor on some elements of defamation including that the allegedly defamatory statements by Fox concerned Dominion, that the statements had been published by Fox and were false.""The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that (it) is CRYSTAL clear that none of the statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,"" wrote Davis, using all capital letters for emphasis.Fox has argued that its coverage of the election claims was protected by press freedoms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment because it was newsworthy and properly framed as opinion or unproven allegations. Fox also has argued that Dominion's suit advances an overly broad interpretation of U.S. defamation law and is a threat to freedom of the press.Lawyers for Fox also have invoked the legal doctrine of ""neutral reportage,"" which holds that the press cannot be held liable for publishing newsworthy allegations in a neutral way.Davis, however, said in his ruling the doctrine would not shield Fox from liability, because the network did not conduct disinterested reporting.Fox faces a similar lawsuit by voting-technology company Smartmatic, which is seeking $2.7 billion in damages from Fox Corp, the cable network, Fox hosts and guests.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 0%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.46 points to a change of +3.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.92 indicates a change of +4.8% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.09 billion and $64.58 billion estimates indicate +2.6% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $16.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of 0%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.34%. The EPS surprise was -0.28%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He also has a soft spot for Swedish Fish.(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)So you’re writing an Ethereum book?I’m getting there. I started in December. I wrote like 10 chapters, and it was really, really tough. And now, there’s, like, six chapters left? The format of the book is how Ethereum works and why—why public blockchains are so important for business—specifically why they’re more important than private blockchains—business use cases, procurement, supply chain management, tokenization, carbon footprint, and why it takes so long for enterprises to adopt technology.When you were at IBM you did some Internet of Things stuff, and some other projects that were cutting edge. Is this sort of a pattern for you, where you want to do the “cool new thing”? Is that just what’s most appealing to you?The thing is, I am very driven by intellectual curiosity. I don’t necessarily go after every single new thing, but when I find a thing that’s really, really important, I go after it. When I was in college—I’m dating myself here—I was like, “Wireless! Wireless is the thing!” I went to work as a summer job at the first mobile network operator in Africa, in Nigeria, and I took an entire year off to work for them before I came back and went to work at McKinsey, where I can remember just telling colleagues, “Mobile data, you’ve got to invest in mobile data.”The best perk of being a VP at IBM was you had access to IBM research. And I had a couple of amazing products, and before I did the one that got me into crypto, I did another one, which was immensely fun, around 3D printing. A lot of people do these corporate white papers—they just do a survey, they present it like it’s subjective data that nine out of 10 executives think that not burning down the planet is a good idea—they present it as if it’s factual data, and it’s not really. What I love to do is get a couple layers below that, and what's really fun is, for instance, we’d ask, “Okay, 3D printing will transform manufacturing, but how will it transform manufacturing?”Story continuesWhat happened with that—the 3D printing?We picked three products—a smartphone, an electric razor, and a washing machine—and we tore them down, literally one piece at a time, evaluated every single component, scanned them in 3D, and then tried to remanufacture as much of the product as possible using a 3D printer. And that was amazing. We came back with specific data on the carbon footprint of 3D printing, the cycle time with 3D printing, we built the economic model of what your manufacturing scales—it's quite transformational. And the next project I did after that was IoT.How did that lead you to Ethereum?So I'm out at Samsung, talking to the head of the multimedia solution center, and he’s like, “Paul, we are going to go broke, the cloud is going to bankrupt us…you’ve got to come up with a better plan.” I thought to myself, this is really bizarre. Imagine a really smart light bulb with the brains of an iPhone, and it’s connected to WiFi. What is your iPhone processor doing? Like nothing, 99% of the time! So why on earth are we paying all this money to maintain massive cloud data centers, when your refrigerator could be providing cloud services, or your phone? So I called a bunch of guys and was like, “We should be able to make a cloud of computing devices that manage themselves, right?” The cloud should be in the devices.Halfway through this project, colleagues were like, “I want you to think about using this thing called Bitcoin, because it’s distributed computing. And we’ve had lots of debates—on the one hand, it’s very computationally intensive, but then on the other hand, it’s not like these machines are doing anything else. So John Cohn, an IBM distinguished engineer, comes and says, “Paul, I’ve met this guy, I think you’d really like him. His name is Vitalik [Buterin]. And he wants to do Bitcoin, but instead of for money, for computing. So we built this thing called ADEPT–Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry, sort of this decentralized cloud infrastructure—for Samsung, with help from Vitalik. And we showed it at CES in January 2015. That’s how I got into Ethereum. That’s how I got into blockchain. And at that point, I was like, this is going to be absolutely revolutionary.What important lessons or ideas from other projects or jobs have you applied to ones on the blockchain?We're heading toward this world where the marginal cost of almost everything is zero. One of the most brilliant things that I heard when I worked at McKinsey was if you want to think about the future, try to imagine some important process or input is free. Just imagine, like, what if electricity was free? What if airfare was free? What if phone calls were free? Like 25 or 30 years ago, this idea that phone calls would be free, it was ridiculous. And yet, we sort of forget. One of the reasons we liked Ethereum was it comes with account payments and smart contracts. And we used to joke that we don’t know what anybody will actually pay for in the Internet of Things, but, eventually, someone will figure out how to monetize it. And when they do, they’ll be so glad this architecture has payments and contracts built in.Has embracing the blockchain helped EY from a competitive standpoint?In the world of audit, we only have three competitors. So my “fair share” of any sort of global audit market is 25%, but it's actually been better than that because I don't think any of our peers have taken this space quite as seriously as we have.So where is this leading? Can you tell me more about plans for the blockchain?A lot of tech systems are natural monopolies. That's just how they are in a world where the marginal cost is zero for products. And then with Metcalfe’s law—the value of a network grows along with the number of participants—at a certain inflection point, your network becomes so valuable you’re effectively a natural monopoly. And that’s hugely shaped our strategy here because it led me down the path to believe there can be only one winning blockchain. There can’t be 50, can’t be 100, and it almost certainly will be a public blockchain. All paths lead to a dominant chain. And when you look at the history of computing platforms, that dominant chain usually becomes clearly visible within a decade of an ecosystem starting.And Ethereum’s that winner?Ethereum was really the only programmable smart contract chain out there that was really dominant. So I said, “Okay, we're making a play.” It's a theory, a bit of the GE mentality where if I have a limited budget, am I going to spread it around, am I going to be okay with a bunch of different blockchains? Or am I going with the best?What prevents the rest of the Big Four from just copying what you’re doing at some point?Obviously, in a decentralized system, you can't do that. And that’s really tough. I've long accepted that. Even if we win this race, there will be no moment where we can just put our feet up and say, “Well, we're a monopolist now. Great.” We will have to keep running hard.When clients come to EY, is it more often, “Oh, hey, by the way, we hear you have this blockchain guy”? or do they walk in like, “We’re here because of the blockchain guy”?It comes in both forms. All the time, I’ll sit down with clients, and they’ll come over, like, “We had no idea you guys knew how to do this stuff.” And that's great. I love that. And it makes me very happy. And, absolutely, you know, our senior people, it's great when somebody writes to the chairman and says, “I just had this guy, Paul Brody, come in and talk to my clients—totally blew their minds. Like now they think of UI differently.”So what’s next—both on your end, and more generally when it comes to the future of finance?If you were to boil down all of our aspirations into a single sentence, it would be this: We believe that blockchain will do for networks and enterprises what ERP did for organizations. It was transformational. Before ERP, the left hand and the right hand didn't really know what was going on.With smart contracts on the public blockchain, I can create tokens that represent all the assets, that connect the buyers and the sellers—and that automatically enforce the processes. Like if you have a volume discount rule, when you achieve your targeted volumes, it automatically gives you a discount. This sounds like a small thing, but, actually, it just happens. No one has to remember. And think about an insurance contract, like in health care, and how after your deductible expires you’ll be referred to specialists, and then the logic just gets more complicated, more challenging. So my goal is to get to the point where we can take any arbitrarily complex business agreement and run it on the public blockchain.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

The license allowed the company to expand oil production there and export it. Refiners, including Valero, have bought cargoes from Chevron.However, Chevron’s resumption of Venezuela crude imports has not led to an increase in the country’s overall exports this year. In February, the company exported some 86,000 barrels per day of Venezuela crude oil.The U.S. trading sanctions were first imposed on Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA in 2019. Before this, Valero was among the top receivers of the South American country’s crude through long-term supply contracts.Valero is seeking the Treasury Department’s permission for sanctions relief, allowing it to directly purchase crude oil from PDVSA. However, no decision is likely to occur soon, implying that the U.S. does not want further easing of Venezuela sanctions until president Nicolas Maduro makes political concessions to Venezuela’s opposition.Price PerformanceShares of Valero have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

164,c82b558c-dc1b-3ca1-9b44-938e89fd131a,MPC,2023-04-01,Marathon (MPC) Benefits From Strong Margins & Fundamentals,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-mpc-benefits-strong-margins-143502329.html,1680273302,STORY,"['MPC', 'MRO', 'SUN', 'CVI']","[Marathon Petroleum MPC — a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products — offers an opportunity for investors interested in the energy sector. The company also has strong earnings trends to back up its future performance.This Findlay, OH-based MPC, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity. It operates primarily in two segments: Refining and Marketing, and Pipeline Transportation (or Midstream).Let’s discuss the reasons that make Marathon Petroleum an attractive pick:Macro TailwindsEven as fears related to high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector over the past year. The space has generated a total return of around 6.2% in the trailing 12 months compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 11.6%. Apart from a relatively constructive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March 2022, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Agreed, oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, However, the commodity still has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile. While the banking sector turmoil did affect the sector temporarily, the crisis seems to have eased now. Crude also got a leg up and is now trading around $75 after U.S. Federal Reserve signaled an imminent end to interest rate increases.Solid Rank and VGM ScoreMarathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry, which carries a Zacks Industry Rank #54 — placing it in the top 22% of around 250 Zacks industries. In addition to the favorable rank, MPC enjoys a Value as well as a Growth Score of A, helping it round out with a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best upside potential.Story continuesQ4 OutperformanceMPC posted robust Q4 results on Jan 31, with earnings per share of $6.65, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 and increased from a profit of merely $1.30 per share in the year-ago period. The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. The operating income of the segment totaled $3.9 billion, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38%. To go with the earnings beat, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares during the fourth quarter.Buying Opportunity Still ExistsAfter bottoming out (in the mid-to-high teens) during the start of the pandemic, MPC shares have turned it around in style. MPC peaked in January this year at over $136 and has held up reasonably well even as most energy scrips faced significant downward momentum. In fact, Marathon Petroleum is up 56.7% in a year while the markets have gone lower. This powerful uptrend during a down market indicates that investors should start looking at the name to see if its right for their portfolio. With the company still experiencing good market conditions, we believe that Marathon Petroleum stock has enough firepower left to keep chugging along. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalyst Estimates RaisedMPC’s earnings revisions have also trended in the right direction over the past 60 days, as analysts have consistently taken up their numbers. As a matter of fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marathon Petroleum’s 2023 bottom line has gone up from a profit of $16.50 to $20.31 over the past 60 days, while next year’s number indicates a rise from $9.29 per share to $12.08.Fundamental StrengthMarathon Petroleum's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, the company’s access to lower-cost crude in the Permian, Bakken and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials. MPC’s portfolio of midstream operations bodes well too, somewhat reducing its exposure to volatile commodity price fluctuations.The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand for refined products like gasoline have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. As a reflection of this, Marathon Petroleum’s fourth-quarter refining margin of $28.82 per barrel improved significantly from $15.88 a year ago.In 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings — owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion. Apart from providing Marathon Petroleum with a much-needed cash infusion, the disposal of its Speedway-branded gas stations came with a supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will provide about 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.Bottom LineGiven this backdrop, the time seems right to consider buying Marathon Petroleum. While there are some apprehensions that the company may have gotten too far ahead of itself, especially with the inflation-triggered cost increases, the tightness in product demand should keep refining margins elevated moving forward. All these suggest strong long-term cash flows that should support higher price points for its shares.Other Energy Stocks to BuyAlong with Marathon Petroleum, investors interested in the energy sector might look at operators like NOW Inc.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Marathon Petroleum (MPC). MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.MPC is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.26. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MPC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.57. Over the past 52 weeks, MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.19, with a median of 0.31.Finally, our model also underscores that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.53. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. MPC's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 4.21. Over the past 52 weeks, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 2.91, with a median of 3.68.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Marathon Petroleum is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, MPC feels like a great value stock at the moment.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And that's GM and Apple. GM reportedly planning to phase out Apple CarPlay and teaming up with Google instead starting with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer. The automaker is going to use its own infotainment system that is developing with Google for future EVs.Why are they doing it? Well, they-- the thought here is that they are going to have access to more data. More data in terms of where you're driving. And also, some of that charging data for the EVs.Now this is a big reversal for GM, who went all in on Apple CarPlay just a few years ago. Right now, Apple CarPlay as well as Android Auto, really lets drivers bypass their car's infotainment system. Potential backlash here. What's going to be discussed is that maybe it could alienate some iPhone users because people who have used CarPlay absolutely love it.ALLIE GARFINKLE: So I've got to tell you, Seana. What I'm hearing here is, on one hand, Apple's ecosystem. That ecosystem is expanding. I feel the tentacles of it reaching out far and wide, right. And that's what the street wants.That's what Apple wants. It's why people, for instance, think they're going to be successful in VR. However, as an Apple user, as an iPhone user, I'm like, what am I going to do with CarPlay? Right? What do I-- you're having a thought drop.- I'm just-- what do I shop around more for? My phone or a car? And I just buy an iPhone every time I'm going to get a new phone, right, versus cars. I don't know about you guys. You should go and drive a couple of models from a couple of different brands and try them out.CarPlay, to me, and Apple CarPlay, to match up with my phone, is an added bonus when I'm driving around those cars. I'm wondering if GM is putting itself in a corner here that maybe it didn't intend to. And if some Apple users are going to say, you know, I can get CarPlay with a Ford, or whatever the other brands are that would offer that. And if it actually hurts GM in a way.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Yeah. And I don't know what really is going to be special about Apple CarPlay, really. I think we'll have to see.]"

The deal is in line with the objective to reduce carbon emissions. In yet another show of the environmentally friendly attitude of airlines, Hawaiian Holdings’ HA subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, entered into a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sales agreement with biofuel company, Gevo.Hawaiian Airlines was also in the news recently, courtesy of its decision to adjust its schedule to match the anticipated demand swell during summer. That story was covered in details in the previous write-up.Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines SAVE also hogged the limelight in the past week owing to its plan to significantly boost its workforce during the current year.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 United Airlines’ decision to invest $15 million in Svante is in line with its plan to go 100% green by 2050. This is the latest environmentally friendly investment from the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund. Svante provides materials and technology as part of the value chain that has the ability to transform CO2 removed from the atmosphere and industrial emission sources into SAF.UAL’s investment will fund and support Svante’s commercial-scale filter manufacturing facility in Vancouver.This move is in line with the airline’s aim to go 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. UAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has so far invested in the future production of more than three billion gallons of SAF, the most by any airline in the world.United Airlines was also in the news when it reportedly reached two-year tentative agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union representing nearly 30,000 ground workers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here2. Per Hawaiian Airlines’ environmentally-friendly deal with Gevo, the former will purchase 50 million gallons of SAF over five years. Gevo is anticipated to supply SAF from a facility to be constructed in the Midwestern United States and start deliveries to Hawaiian Holdings’ gateway cities in California in 2029. This deal is subject to certain conditions, which include Gevo developing, financing and constructing the facility to produce SAF.Story continues3. Spirit Airlines intends to hire 4000 plus employees across various roles (pilots, flight attendants, aviation maintenance technicians and other support center staff) in 2023. Per Linde Grindle, senior vice president and chief human resources officer at Spirit Airlines, ""We're welcoming thousands of new Spirit Family Members across our network this year and have a broad range of positions available for people with all different interests, talents and experience levels."" Given the carrier’s plans to expand its fleet and buoyant air-travel demand, the decision to go on a hiring spree seems to be a prudent one.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that all airline stocks have traded in the green over the past five trading days.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock is down 82% year-to-date.The company's last few years have been chaotic, amid a dwindling footprint of stores, which sell everything from kitchenware to linens.Here’s a look at how the stock got here:In January, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it had defaulted on its loans and didn’t have the funds to pay its debt. Its liquidity issues have made it difficult for the company to keep up with vendor relations and retain talent.The company has been shutting down more and more stores, shrinking its footprint to 360 locations, down from more than 1,550 open in 2017.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has made attempts to turn itself around, but to no avail. In 2019, the company brought in Mark Tritton, a former Target (TGT) executive. His tenure lasted until June 2022, when board member and retail veteran Sue Gove was tapped to lead the company, after quarterly sales had collapsed a whopping 27%.In August, when the stock was trading at $10 per share, Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba told Yahoo Finance Live that BBBY was only worth $1 and that the company is in a ""death spiral"" and may go out of business in under a year.BBBY had been a meme stock favorite since 2021. When activist investor Ryan Cohen's RC Ventures took a 9.8% stake in company in March of 2022, the stock shot up 86%, hovering around $22. Cohen was nicknamed ""Papa John"" after his involvement in GameStop (GME), eventually becoming chairperson of the company.However Cohen's push for strategic changes at BBBY was short lived. In August of last year he dumped his entire stake in the retailer, cashing out 9.45 million shares and call options for a profit of $68 million. The stock declined about 40% in one day following his exit.Story continuesA Hail Mary pass to stay in business came in February of this year, when Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced a deal with hedge fund Hudson Bay Capital to secure $1.025 billion in funding via an equity offering. That day shares declined more than 40% to about $3 each.The stock spiraled down even more since then, and Hudson Bay abandoned its agreement. On Thursday March 30, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would tap the public markets in an equity offering worth up to $300 million, otherwise it could face bankruptcy.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

But shoppers are finding that Dollar Tree sells some of the same shelf-stable merchandise as supercenters like Target and Walmart — often for half the price.TikTok account Dollar Tree Dinners, which shows people how to cook healthy and filling meals with ingredients from Dollar Tree, recently revealed some incredible bargains.1. Sunkist Orange Peach Mango Drink PowderFor those looking to reduce carbs or calories and want to flavor their water, drink powders are a hot (or cold!) trend. Dollar Tree has the Sunkist brand for just $1.25. Target, meanwhile, sells the Crystal Light variety for $2.59. The Sunkist brand is actually better for many people, since Crystal Light contains aspartame, which may cause allergic reactions in some people.Even Target’s store brand water flavoring costs more, with a 30-pack going for $4.99, compared to $1.25 for a 10-pack at Dollar Tree.Hidden Gems: Affordable Luxury Goods at Aldi2. Stove Top StuffingName-brand Stove Top stuffing is a steal for $1.25 at Dollar Tree. The same product is $2.49 at Target.3. Chicken of the Sea CrabmeatArtificial crabmeat is perfect for homemade sushi, easy crab bisque soup or crab dip. You can find name brand Chicken of the Sea Crabmeat, the same company known for canned tuna, in pouches for just $1.25 at Dollar Tree.Target doesn’t seem to carry the exact same product, but imitation crab meat ranges from $3.19 for 6 oz. to $3.69 for 8 oz. at Target. Dollar Tree’s $1 pouch is 2.5 oz., so it’s still the better deal.Story continuesWhen you comparison shop, you always want to check package sizes to ensure you’re really saving money. In the case of artificial crab meat, Dollar Tree prices beat out competitors.4. SeaweedDried and roasted seaweed is a fantastic, low-calorie and low-carb snack. Dollar Tree has snack packages available for just $1.25, while Target sells a similar snack for $2.19 per package. Even if you compare the 4-pack in Target for $4.69, you’ll still save money at Dollar Tree.5. Splenda Coffee CreamerFind Splenda Coffee Creamer in your choice of Sweet Cream or French Vanilla at Dollar Tree for $1.25 for an 8 oz. bottle. Target sells the 32 oz. size of Coffee Mate brand for $4.49 or the International Delight for $3.99. That means you can actually get a better deal at Target, but if you don’t need 32 oz. of coffee creamer, Dollar Tree still offers a pretty good price.More From GOBankingRatesJaspreet Singh Shares 5 Ways To Grow $10k to $100k in Three YearsThe Nuclear Savings Rule: 10 Frugal Living Tips from the 1950s Era3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Brand-New Items at Dollar Tree That Cost Way More at Target]"

VSH is making strong efforts toward bolstering its thick-film resistor offerings, evident from the latest enhancement of its Draloric RCS0805 e3 resistor in the 0805 case size with a higher power rating of 0.5 W.Notably, RCS0805 e3 comes with a resistance range from 1 Ω to 10 MΩ with tolerances of ± 0.5 %, ± 1 % and ± 5 %.Further, it provides an operating voltage of 150 V and an operating temperature range of -55 °C to +155 °C.Additionally, the increased power rating makes the underlined resistor capable of being used in place of four standard parallel resistors in the 0805 case size, two parallel devices in the larger 1206 case size and one resistor in the 1210 case size.Hence, Vishay is likely to gain strong momentum across the automotive, industrial, telecommunications and medical applications as the increased power rating of RCS0805 e3 enables the designers to save board space in these applications.Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Price and Consensus Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Price and ConsensusVishay Intertechnology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Quote Resistor Market Holds PromiseThe thick-film resistor market is riding on the growing proliferation of consumer electronic devices globally. Further, increasing the usage of thick-film resistors in automotive components remains a positive.Also, the emergence of hybrid electric vehicles remains a key catalyst in the thick-film resistor market.Additionally, the rapid deployment of 5G is further accelerating the need for these resistors.We believe the latest move makes Vishay well poised to capitalize on these opportunities.According to a report from Verified Market Research, the global market for thick-film resistors is expected to reach $666.6 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 4.9% between 2023 and 2030.Expanding Product PortfolioThe latest move aligns with the company’s growing efforts toward expanding its overall product portfolio.Apart from the latest move, Vishay recently rolled out a new series of automotive-grade thick film chip resistors called Vishay Techno CDMA.Further, it upgraded its TSOP2xxx, TSOP4xxx, TSOP57xxx, TSOP6xxx and TSOP77xxx series of Infrared Receiver (IR) modules with the new Cyllene 2 IC.Vishay unveiled three new series of automotive-grade surface-mount standard rectifiers, 2 A SE20Nx, 3 A SE30Nx and 4 A SE40Nx. Further, these devices offer improved reverse recovery energy and fast recovery time and can also be utilized as high-frequency rectifiers for bootstrapping driver functionality.Additionally, it rolled out two new 30 V symmetric dual n-channel power MOSFETs, SiZF5300DT and SiZF5302DT, which can be used in place of two discrete devices in the PowerPAK 1212 package.We believe that the above-mentioned endeavors will continue to shape the company’s growth trajectory and sustain momentum in various end markets, which in turn will aid it in winning investors’ confidence further.Shares of Vishay have gained 16.1% in the past year against the industry’s loss of 33.8%.However, Vishay is currently suffering from coronavirus-led supply-chain constraints, consumer market softness and the impacts of geo-political tensions.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Vishay carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Salesforce CRM and Analog Devices ADI.

185,bd16b692-f1d3-3e2a-9749-8b519532ac2c,ADI,2023-04-01,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Analog Devices Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-analog-123012104.html,1680265812,STORY,['ADI'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Analog Devices (ADI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ADI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Analog Devices' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Analog Devices' main business drivers.Analog Devices, Inc. is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts. The company is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.The product line is composed of amplifiers and comparators; analog to digital converters; digital to analog converters; video encoders and decoders; embedded processing products and DSPs; MEMS and temperature sensors; RF/IF components and converters; power and thermal management ICs, audio/video converters, amplifiers, CODECs, filters and processors.The company also offers analog, digital and RF switches and multiplexers; analog microcontrollers; clock and timing products; voltage references; interface products such as isolators, translators and transceivers; wireless products and converters; broadband products including amplifiers, CODECs, chipsets, splitters.Analog Devices has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Ireland, and Southeast Asia. The company also uses outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Notably, the company generated $12.01 billion revenues in fiscal 2022.The company generates revenues from four organized end-markets – Industrial, Consumer, Communications and Automotive.In Industrial market (50.5% of fiscal 2022 revenues), Analog Devices caters to the needs of industrial and instrumentation, defense/aerospace, energy management and healthcare sectors.In Communications market (15.7%), Analog Devices offers products required in internet infrastructures, broadband and wireless applications.For Automotive market (20.9%), the company offers products that are utilized in infotainment, electrification, autonomous, ADAS and safety applications.Further, the company takes care of the requirements in feature-rich, high-performance products such as portable devices and prosumer video/audio equipment in the Consumer market (12.9%).The company caters to the growing demand for its products in these afore mentioned markets via its strong sales channels. We note that it has direct sales offices, sales representatives and distributors in more than 50 countries.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Analog Devices, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in March 2013 would be worth $4,177.46, or a gain of 317.75%, as of March 31, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 158.15% and the price of gold went up 19.23% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ADI too.Analog Devices posted fiscal first quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues grew year over year. Strength across communication, consumer, industrial and automotive end-markets drove the results. Solid demand for high-performance analog as well as mixed signal solutions was a tailwind. Strong momentum across the electric vehicle space on the back of robust Battery Management System solutions remains a positive. Further, growing power design wins are other positives. Solid momentum of HEV platform across cabin electronics ecosystem remains a tailwind. Considering the abovementioned factors, we expect second-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue to rise 4.9% year over year. However, pandemic induced supply-chain constraints are concerns. Further, geopolitical tensions led by Russia-Ukraine war are major overhangs.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.21%, and there have been 13 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Snap-On in FocusSnap-On (SNA) is headquartered in Kenosha, and is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The stock has seen a price change of 5.87% since the start of the year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is paying out a dividend of $1.62 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.68% compared to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.21% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.73%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.61%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Snap-On's current payout ratio is 39%, meaning it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $17.10 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 1.66%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, SNA presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Verizon Communications Inc.

See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Although the share price is down over three years, Verizon Communications actually managed to grow EPS by 2.8% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.It looks to us like the market was probably too optimistic around growth three years ago. However, taking a look at other business metrics might shed a bit more light on the share price action.We note that the dividend seems healthy enough, so that probably doesn't explain the share price drop. Revenue has been pretty flat over three years, so that isn't an obvious reason shareholders would sell. A closer look at revenue and profit trends might yield insights.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthVerizon Communications is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Verizon Communications stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Verizon Communications the TSR over the last 3 years was -19%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Verizon Communications shareholders are down 20% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 11%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 0.2%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Verizon Communications .Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Nobody is better prepared to provide a secure and reliable network of this scale. With Saab’s FAA, air traffic management, and system wide information management (SWIM) experience, our team is ready to help the FAA evolve toward their information-centric operations vision.”Story continues“Frequentis is proud to partner with Verizon on the FENS program with our high-availability network equipment. We are looking forward to supporting Verizon’s FENS team in its evolution of the FAA’s network infrastructure,” said Dieter Eier, President of Frequentis USA.Verizon's network solution is designed for the future with an array of new capabilities to meet the next generation of applications with greater bandwidth requirements. The communications infrastructure supports air and ground safety for passenger, freight and selected Department of Defense flights via three separate networks, one for NAS, one for administrative and one for research and development.FENS is the successor to the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) contract, which was implemented in 2002 to provide consolidated telecom services for the 5,000 facilities and 30,000 circuits in the NAS. By extension, FENS will serve as the primary means for FAA's telecommunications services and forms the basic infrastructure for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen.Additionally, the new enterprise platform managed by Verizon will provide the FAA with features such as dynamic service provisioning and reconfiguration, survivability, on-demand Service Flow routing to deliver higher security, faster performance and a flexible, more seamless user experience. Verizon also will provide an extensive set of support services including program management, network engineering, configuration management, test and evaluation (T&amp;E), service ordering and provisioning, network and security management and operations.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $136.8 billion in 2022. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.Media contact: Geoff Basye202-748-1882geoffrey.basye@verizon.com]"
196,c77668e8-819b-326a-b7c9-1d413ff3bdc7,VZ,2023-04-01,Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-attracting-130001356.html,1680267601,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +0.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 points to a change of -9.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.78 indicates a change of +2.3% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $137.85 billion and $139.63 billion estimates indicate +0.7% and +1.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $35.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was -0.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""You also have a smart kid in your house, but instead of supporting his study, you asked him to make quick money while he was still able to perform manual labour.""Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Many netizens find the metaphor apt in describing the root of China's technological shortcomings. Despite strong policy and financial support by the state, as well as ample private investment, the country has been unable to beat the US to the punch in creating a cutting-edge AI chatbot like ChatGPT.In 2018, President Xi Jinping conducted a special study session with the Politburo. It concluded that AI was strategically important, and could lead to a technological revolution and industrial changes with ""profound impact on economic development, social progress, and the pattern of the international political economy"".With the blessing of China's top leadership, government and private funding poured into domestic AI start-ups.Chinese AI start-up launched a household robot in 2022, designed to play Chinese chess with humans. Photo: Handout alt=Chinese AI start-up launched a household robot in 2022, designed to play Chinese chess with humans. Photo: Handout&gt;Story continuesIn the ensuing years, the country saw the emergence of the ""four little dragons"" - Cloudwalk Technology, Megvii, SenseTime, and Yitu - all focused on the AI field of visual recognition.Meanwhile, commercial products bearing the AI label have flooded the Chinese market. SenseTime, for instance, launched a robot designed solely for teaching kids how to play chess.By 2021, Chinese firms claimed to have produced 21 large language models, up from just two in 2020, putting them on a par with the United States. A large language model, according to AI chip designer Nvidia, represents a deep-learning algorithm that can recognise, summarise, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive data sets.But the arrival of ChatGPT shattered the illusion that China and the US were competing neck and neck in AI.Zhou Hongyi, founder of 360 Security Technology, says China's AI development lags behind the level of OpenAI. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Zhou Hongyi, founder of 360 Security Technology, says China's AI development lags behind the level of OpenAI. Photo: Shutterstock&gt;China's knowledge level in AI is two to three years behind OpenAI, the San Francisco-based start-up that created ChatGPT, said Zhou Hongyi, founder of cybersecurity firm 360 Security Technology and an industry veteran with close ties to Chinese authorities, at the China Development Forum last weekend.That technological gap, however, has not deterred Chinese companies and entrepreneurs from touting their own plans to launch their own ChatGPT rivals in the country, where the chatbot is not officially available, because of the government's attitude towards uncensored content.In March, internet search giant Baidu launched Ernie Bot, becoming the first major tech company in China to launch its own GPT-like service. Wang Huiwen, co-founder of on-demand services giant Meituan, and Lee Kai-fu, former China head of Google, have both started new ventures to explore the business potential of generative AI.But analysts caution that this gold rush could be short-lived owing to lack of technical expertise and experience, compounded by US export restrictions on AI chips, which would hinder the development of a true ChatGPT-equivalent in China.Lee Kai-fu, former head of Google China, has launched a new venture looking into the business potential of ChatGPT-like technologies. Photo: Edmond So alt=Lee Kai-fu, former head of Google China, has launched a new venture looking into the business potential of ChatGPT-like technologies. Photo: Edmond So&gt;The fanfare around ChatGPT only shows how much the market is craving for a new investment narrative, according to Bo Pei, an equity analyst at Tiger Securities. ""After so many years of development, both the Western and Chinese internet industries are saturated and thirsting for a new direction.""""It is questionable how soon ChatGPT-like tools will actually make an impact or produce meaningful revenue,"" Bo said.One big obstacle is China's walled internet. With the Chinese government prohibiting the country's more than 1 billion internet users from accessing uncensored content, the materials that researchers can use to train AI engines are more limited than in the West.A random test conducted by the Post last month, for example, found that Baidu's Ernie Bot was unable to answer questions related to topics deemed politically sensitive by Beijing. When asked if China was a democratic nation, the chatbot ducked the question, simply replying that it ""hasn't learned how to answer this question yet"".Baidu CEO Robin Li Yanhong introduces the functions of Ernie Bot during a launch event in Beijing on March 16.

Photo: AP Photo&gt;""Censorship could certainly hinder China's ability to develop a local equivalent to ChatGPT,"" Dahlia Peterson, a research analyst at Georgetown University's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology, said in February.""Even if [Chinese] AI companies are able to access and utilise global data and research resources to train their AI models, it is unlikely Chinese authorities will allow them to use any material deemed as politically sensitive in their replies,"" she added.While censorship will not stop China from coming up with its own answers to ChatGPT, much in the same way that the country developed its own search engines after Google pulled out of the market, it could take two to three years for Chinese industry players to develop models that are at least 80 per cent as powerful as ChatGPT, according to research company Third Bridge.And as China continues to fence off its internet, its gap with global AI leaders, such as the US, could widen. Within just four months after the public launch of ChatGPT in November, OpenAI released its next-generation language prediction model GPT-4, which has more sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to analyse images.A sign at the Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California.

Photo: Getty Images via AFP&gt;China's lack of access to the best chips for AI training could further delay its efforts to catch up with the US, according to Phelix Lee, an equity analyst at Morningstar Asia.American semiconductor giant Nvidia, which holds a virtual monopoly over high-end AI chips, is restricted by Washington from exporting its H100 and A100 chips to clients in China. The company now produces tailor-made chips, which are of lower performance, for the Chinese market.Chinese AI ""development may be bottlenecked by US restrictions if China is unable to increase hardware sufficiency, and the severity of the bottleneck depends on how sophisticated AI systems become"", Lee said.The immensity of that challenge may well be illustrated by the reluctance of Chinese tech giants, save for Baidu, to show off any ChatGPT-like services to the public.Alibaba Group Holding, which has invested in large language models, has not said when it will roll out its own ChatGPT rival. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Alibaba Group Holding, which has invested in large language models, has not said when it will roll out its own ChatGPT rival. Photo: Bloomberg&gt;Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post, has yet to provide a timetable for the launch of a commercial product based on its large language models, despite having invested in AI for years.Tencent Holdings has not provided any launch plans either, only saying it ""will keep investing in cutting-edge technologies"", such as machine learning.Baidu, meanwhile, finds its Ernie Bot being constantly compared to ChatGPT. While the company's shares gained 14 per cent on the February day that it announced plans to launch an intelligent chatbot, they lost 10 per cent on Ernie Bot's launch day, when founder Robin Li Yanhong showed the technology with pre-recorded videos rather than a live demonstration.Last month, Li admitted that Ernie Bot lagged behind ChatGPT for about ""one or two months"". But he also played down the geopolitical implications of Ernie Bot, saying that it ""isn't a tool for China to compete against the United States"".Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of Open AI, speaks during an event at the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington in February. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of Open AI, speaks during an event at the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington in February. Photo: Bloomberg&gt;It is too early to predict how much revenue or profit companies can generate from the likes of ChatGPT, as businesses are still exploring real-life applications of these chat bots, according to Wang Kai, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar Asia.""We are encouraged by the possibilities, but we still need to figure out how exactly [chatbots] will be monetised,"" he said.Baidu has said it wants to integrate Ernie Bot across all its existing businesses, starting with its search engine, to ""reshape the way information is generated and presented"". The technology will eventually be used to support Baidu's smart speaker Xiaodu, self-driving unit Apollo, and video platform iQiyi, the company said.Over 650 Chinese organisations have announced partnerships with Ernie Bot, including smartphone brand Honor, travel-booking site Ctrip, carmaker Geely Auto, and electronics giants Lenovo Group and TCL, according to Baidu.Still, even as more Chinese tech firms jump on the chatbot bandwagon, many might see their costly bets failing to pan out, according to Lu Yanxia, research director at information technology consultancy IDC.Solely relying on large language models will not provide a sustained edge for any firm, Lu wrote in a research note in February. ChatGPT-like technologies will also have a limited impact on the market at the moment, while many related AI models might even become irrelevant in the long run, she said.""The true revelation [of ChatGPT] is that these language models will evolve and contribute to the advent of general AI, and that the application of these language models will push for a paradigm shift in AI development and narrow down the industry chain,"" the research concluded.Some experts have gone as far as calling for tech companies and researchers around the world to pause the training of AI models more powerful than GPT-4.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is among dozens of tech industry veterans who have signed an open letter calling for a halt in the training of AI models more intelligent than GPT-4. Photo: Getty Images/TNS alt=Tesla CEO Elon Musk is among dozens of tech industry veterans who have signed an open letter calling for a halt in the training of AI models more intelligent than GPT-4. Photo: Getty Images/TNS&gt;""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity,"" the Future of Life Institute wrote in an open letter this week, signed by Tesla founder Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and dozens of other tech veterans.""Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, make us obsolete and replace us?"" it asked.""Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable,"" it said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

And Paramount Global (PARA) says investment in its streaming service Paramount+ is at a high — meaning that investors can expect it will spend less in the future.All of that could bode well for profitability, which is increasingly a focus for investors. The stock market wiped a whopping $500 billion-plus in market capitalization from the world's biggest media, cable, and entertainment giants in 2022. Meantime, interest rates have gone up, making borrowing more expensive.“As we now painfully know, money is no longer cheap,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said in a recent note. ""Wall Street’s attitude towards streaming has now largely reversed course as more skeptics raise the question of whether streaming is a good business (a question we have long been asking). In turn, companies are no longer willing to spend whatever it takes, in part because attitudes and strategies have shifted and rationalized, but also because their balance sheets no longer have what it takes.”'Peak losses' in sight? Comcast's fledgling streaming service Peacock saw its operating loss increase 47% to $2.5 billion in 2022 from the prior year, the company revealed in its latest earnings report. Comcast president Michael Cavanagh told investors on the earnings call in January, ""We believe 2023 will be peak losses for Peacock and from there, steadily improve."" He estimated losses will total about $3 billion this year.""We spend quite a bit of money creating content so migrating some of that content as eyeballs move to a more streaming universe — we like what we're doing,"" Cavanagh said. ""We think Peacock is absolutely the right strategy for our company.""Meanwhile, Disney's direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022 ended on Oct. 1, after it spent an estimated $33 billion on content last year. On the company's earnings call in November, Disney's CFO Christine McCarthy said that ""peak losses are now behind us.""Story continuesOther companies have emphasized that they are cutting costs. Paramount Global (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish said in February that “we are at peak investment in 2023” in Paramount+.Paramount reported a direct-to-consumer loss of roughly $1.82 billion in 2022 — slightly above previous guidance of $1.8 billion.Streaming-facing companies grappled with heavy losses last year — but media executives, like Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish, have preached brighter days are aheadAnd Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has dealt with a slew of merger-induced challenges, reported a direct-to-consumer loss of $217 million in the fourth quarter — a $511 million improvement over last year. CEO David Zaslav told investors during the company's Q4 earnings call, ""The bulk of our restructuring is behind us. ...We are one company now.""The embattled media giant also announced it will be raising its $3.5 billion cost-savings target to $4 billion over the next two years.Strategy shifts &amp; restructuring playsExpectations that streaming losses will ease come amid a backdrop of cost-cutting in the industry.As media executives look to pare losses and cut down on costs, many have committed to sizable restructuring efforts — like Disney, which reorganized the business into three separate units and recently began the process of laying off 7,000 workers in an effort to slash $5.5 billion in costs.In his prepared remarks during the company's first quarter earnings report on Feb. 8, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the new strategic organization, ""will result in a more cost-effective coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations, and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment.""Iger has also hinted Hulu could be on the chopping block as the deadline approaches for Disney to buy out Comcast's 33% stake in the streaming business.""I’ve talked about general entertainment being undifferentiated. I'm not going to speculate if we're a buyer or a seller of it,"" Iger said during an interview with CNBC last month. ""But I'm concerned about undifferentiated general entertainment. We're going to look at it very objectively.""The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attends the Nominees Luncheon for the 95th Oscars in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniParamount has also taken steps to restructure its business, unveiling a reorganization that combines Showtime with MTV Entertainment Studios. The move comes after the company announced it will be merging its Paramount+ and Showtime streaming services into one offering dubbed ""Paramount+ with Showtime.""As a result, Paramount said it will take a content impairment charge between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, but expects $700 million in future annual savings.More price hikes, revenue initiativesPrice hikes and other profitability measures, such as ad-supported tiers and password-sharing crackdowns, have also emerged as top priorities for 2023.Disney's Iger admitted the company was ""off"" on pricing for its Disney+ streaming service, suggesting there's room to raise prices after it debuted an ad-supported offering late last year. Current Disney+ pricing stands at $7.99 for the ad tier and $10.99 for the ad-free version.Paramount, meanwhile, said price hikes will come later this year in an effort to stem losses. The new monthly price for the premium Paramount+/Showtime tier will jump to $11.99 — up from $9.99. The essential Paramount+ tier with ads will rise by just $1 to $5.99.""Paramount+ is far from the industry price leader,"" CEO Bakish said on the earnings call. ""We're on the value end of the pricing spectrum.""Although Netflix (NFLX) has not yet raised prices this year, the streamer has committed to a sweeping password sharing crackdown even as intense backlash from users builds.So far, the streamer has broadened the crackdown to include countries like Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain, in addition to the test countries like Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru. So far, there has been no announcement regarding U.S. users.Netflix has also leaned on differentiated content like live comedy specials, in addition to advertising.According to Bloomberg, Netflix's ad-supported service reached roughly 1 million monthly active users in the U.S. after its second month on the market—bucking earlier reports the ad tier was off to a slow start.Alexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

REUTERS/Henry NichollsIn his prepared remarks during the company's first quarter earnings report on Feb. 8, Iger said the new strategic organization ""will result in a more cost-effective coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations, and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment.""Amid that challenging environment, Iger has stressed a direct link between content decisions and financial performance — stressing his preference of differentiated content over general entertainment.""Disney is facing some big decisions on its streaming services, and we wonder if the fates of ESPN and Hulu could be intertwined,"" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note published on Wednesday.Nollen suggested Disney might sell its majority stake in Hulu in order to fund ESPN's over-the-top network initiatives as Iger remains bullish on the sports behemoth.Story continuesIger, who described ESPN as ""a differentiator"" for Disney, said the biggest challenge centered around monetization but that the ESPN brand was ""very healthy.""Iger's ESPN comments very much differ what he told CNBC about Hulu in February, revealing ""everything was on the table"" in regards to Hulu’s future.""I’ve talked about general entertainment being undifferentiated. I'm not going to speculate if we're a buyer or a seller of it,"" Iger said. ""But I'm concerned about undifferentiated general entertainment. We're going to look at it very objectively.""Disney currently owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast’s Universal (CMCSA) controlling the rest.Under the terms of the joint ownership agreement, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake in Hulu as early as January 2024 at a guaranteed minimum equity value of $27.5 billion (or about $9.2 billion for the 33% stake.)Some analysts have suggested Disney could sell its majority stake to help offset streaming losses in an ultra-competitive landscape.Citi analyst Jason Bazinet previously estimated Hulu's price tag could be valued anywhere from $19.8 billion to $27.5 billion.""Selling Hulu for &gt;$18bn could go a long way for the rest of Disney,"" Macquarie's Nollen wrote. ""CEO Bob Iger has indicated ESPN remains a core business but needs to figure out a streaming future. Iger has sounded less sure on Hulu.""""Selling 2/3 of Hulu for a minimum of $18 billion equates to nearly 40% of Disney’s current debt, or it could be reinvested into the core Disney and ESPN,"" the analyst suggested.Disney vs. DeSantisIger may also face questions from shareholders regarding Disney's long-standing special tax district after the new oversight board, appointed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, accused the previous board (controlled by Disney) of passing a last minute agreement to essentially render them powerless.According to the agreement, published by the Orlando Sentinel, Disney can veto any major changes to the parks to ""ensure consistency with the overall design and theming."" It also prohibits the board from using Disney's name or characters like Mickey Mouse without the corporation's approval first.The agreement also invokes something called a ""royal lives"" clause, which says the declaration is valid until ""21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, king of England living as of the date of this declaration,"" if it is deemed to violate rules against perpetuity, according to the document.A Walt Disney World photographer holds a Pride rainbow-coloured Mickey Mouse cutout before the ""Festival of Fantasy"" parade at the Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida, U.S. July 30, 2022.

It completely circumvents the authority of this board to govern,"" according to the Orlando Sentinel.The board has hired conservative D.C. law firm Cooper &amp; Kirk to challenge the agreement.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned -0.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has gained 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Disney is expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 points to a change of +12.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.42 indicates a change of +36.2% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Disney is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.1 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $90.27 billion and $96.72 billion estimates indicate +9.1% and +7.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $23.51 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.8%. EPS of $0.99 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.76%. The EPS surprise was +43.48%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(OKE) closed at $63.54, marking a +1.62% move from the previous day. This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.44%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.26%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 5.21%.Heading into today, shares of the natural gas company had lost 6.21% over the past month, lagging the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 2.11% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.28% in that time.Oneok Inc. will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Oneok Inc. to post earnings of $1.81 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 108.05%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.56 billion, up 2.13% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.40 per share and revenue of $22.3 billion. These totals would mark changes of +40.63% and -0.37%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Oneok Inc. should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

And Paramount Global (PARA) says investment in its streaming service Paramount+ is at a high — meaning that investors can expect it will spend less in the future.All of that could bode well for profitability, which is increasingly a focus for investors. The stock market wiped a whopping $500 billion-plus in market capitalization from the world's biggest media, cable, and entertainment giants in 2022. Meantime, interest rates have gone up, making borrowing more expensive.“As we now painfully know, money is no longer cheap,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said in a recent note. ""Wall Street’s attitude towards streaming has now largely reversed course as more skeptics raise the question of whether streaming is a good business (a question we have long been asking). In turn, companies are no longer willing to spend whatever it takes, in part because attitudes and strategies have shifted and rationalized, but also because their balance sheets no longer have what it takes.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.'Peak losses' in sight? Comcast's fledgling streaming service Peacock saw its operating loss increase 47% to $2.5 billion in 2022 from the prior year, the company revealed in its latest earnings report. Comcast president Michael Cavanagh told investors on the earnings call in January, ""We believe 2023 will be peak losses for Peacock and from there, steadily improve."" He estimated losses will total about $3 billion this year.""We spend quite a bit of money creating content so migrating some of that content as eyeballs move to a more streaming universe — we like what we're doing,"" Cavanagh said. ""We think Peacock is absolutely the right strategy for our company.""Meanwhile, Disney's direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022 ended on Oct. 1, after it spent an estimated $33 billion on content last year. On the company's earnings call in November, Disney's CFO Christine McCarthy said that ""peak losses are now behind us.""Story continuesOther companies have emphasized that they are cutting costs. Paramount Global (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish said in February that “we are at peak investment in 2023” in Paramount+.Paramount reported a direct-to-consumer loss of roughly $1.82 billion in 2022 — slightly above previous guidance of $1.8 billion.Streaming-facing companies grappled with heavy losses last year — but media executives, like Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish, have preached brighter days are aheadAnd Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which has dealt with a slew of merger-induced challenges, reported a direct-to-consumer loss of $217 million in the fourth quarter — a $511 million improvement over last year. CEO David Zaslav told investors during the company's Q4 earnings call, ""The bulk of our restructuring is behind us. ...We are one company now.""The embattled media giant also announced it will be raising its $3.5 billion cost-savings target to $4 billion over the next two years.Strategy shifts &amp; restructuring playsExpectations that streaming losses will ease come amid a backdrop of cost-cutting in the industry.As media executives look to pare losses and cut down on costs, many have committed to sizable restructuring efforts — like Disney, which reorganized the business into three separate units and recently began the process of laying off 7,000 workers in an effort to slash $5.5 billion in costs.In his prepared remarks during the company's first quarter earnings report on Feb. 8, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the new strategic organization, ""will result in a more cost-effective coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations, and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment.""Iger has also hinted Hulu could be on the chopping block as the deadline approaches for Disney to buy out Comcast's 33% stake in the streaming business.""I’ve talked about general entertainment being undifferentiated. I'm not going to speculate if we're a buyer or a seller of it,"" Iger said during an interview with CNBC last month. ""But I'm concerned about undifferentiated general entertainment. We're going to look at it very objectively.""The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attends the Nominees Luncheon for the 95th Oscars in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniParamount has also taken steps to restructure its business, unveiling a reorganization that combines Showtime with MTV Entertainment Studios. The move comes after the company announced it will be merging its Paramount+ and Showtime streaming services into one offering dubbed ""Paramount+ with Showtime.""As a result, Paramount said it will take a content impairment charge between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, but expects $700 million in future annual savings.More price hikes, revenue initiativesPrice hikes and other profitability measures, such as ad-supported tiers and password-sharing crackdowns, have also emerged as top priorities for 2023.Disney's Iger admitted the company was ""off"" on pricing for its Disney+ streaming service, suggesting there's room to raise prices after it debuted an ad-supported offering late last year. Current Disney+ pricing stands at $7.99 for the ad tier and $10.99 for the ad-free version.Paramount, meanwhile, said price hikes will come later this year in an effort to stem losses. The new monthly price for the premium Paramount+/Showtime tier will jump to $11.99 — up from $9.99. The essential Paramount+ tier with ads will rise by just $1 to $5.99.""Paramount+ is far from the industry price leader,"" CEO Bakish said on the earnings call. ""We're on the value end of the pricing spectrum.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Although Netflix (NFLX) has not yet raised prices this year, the streamer has committed to a sweeping password sharing crackdown even as intense backlash from users builds.So far, the streamer has broadened the crackdown to include countries like Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain, in addition to the test countries like Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru. So far, there has been no announcement regarding U.S. users.Netflix has also leaned on differentiated content like live comedy specials, in addition to advertising.According to Bloomberg, Netflix's ad-supported service reached roughly 1 million monthly active users in the U.S. after its second month on the market—bucking earlier reports the ad tier was off to a slow start.Alexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(AP) — Under intense scrutiny from Washington that could lead to a potential ban, the top attorney for TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance defended the social media platform’s plan to safeguard U.S. user data from China.“The basic approach that we’re following is to make it physically impossible for any government, including the Chinese government, to get access to U.S. user data,"" said general counsel Erich Andersen during a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press at a cybersecurity conference in Sausalito, California, on Friday sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation and Aspen Digital and featuring top government officials, tech executives and journalists.ByteDance will continue to develop its new app called Lemon8, Andersen said.“We’re obviously going to do our best with the Lemon8 app to comply with U.S. law and to make sure we do the right thing here,"" Andersen said, referring to the new social app developed by ByteDance that resembles Instagram and Pinterest. “But I think we got a long way to go with that application — it's pretty much a startup phase.”ByteDance’s most known app, TikTok, is under intense scrutiny over concerns it could hand over user data to the Chinese government or push pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation on its behalf. Lemon8 was introduced across app stores in Japan in April 2020 and has been rolled out in more countries since then. It's available for download in the U.S. and could face similar scrutiny to TikTok.Leaders at the FBI, CIA and officials at other government agencies have warned that ByteDance could be forced to give user data — such as browsing history, IP addresses and biometric identifiers — to Beijing under a 2017 law that compels companies to cooperate with the government for matters involving China’s national security. Another Chinese law, implemented in 2014, has similar mandates.To assuage concerns from U.S. officials, TikTok has been emphasizing a $1.5 billion proposal, called Project Texas, to store all U.S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle. Under the plan, access to U.S. data would be managed by U.S. employees through a separate entity called TikTok U.S. Data Security, which is run independently of ByteDance and monitored by outside observers.Story continuesSome lawmakers have said that’s not enough. But despite skepticism about the project, TikTok says it is moving forward anyway.“We’re investing in a system where people don’t have to believe the Chinese government and they don’t have to believe us,” Andersen said.He also wondered if the skepticism was being driven by something else.“Where are we falling short here?” he said. “At some point you get beyond the cybersecurity risk assessment, etcetera, and you get to ‘We don’t like your nationality.’”TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has said the company started deleting all historic U.S. user data from non-Oracle servers this month and expects that process to be completed this year. During a congressional hearing held last week, Chew said migrating the data to Oracle will keep it out of China’s hands, but also acknowledged China-based employees may still have access to it before the process wraps up.TikTok maintains it has never been requested to turn over any kind of data and won’t do so if asked. But whether those promises, or Project Texas, will allow it to stay operating in the U.S. remains to be seen.The U.S., as well as Britain, the European Union and others, have banned TikTok on government devices. And the Biden administration is reportedly threatening a U.S. ban on the app unless its Chinese owners divest their stakes in the company.On Friday, Andersen said a ban would be ""basically giving up"".“Banning a platform like TikTok is a defeat, it’s a statement that we aren’t creative enough to find another way,” he said.China has said it would oppose a possible sale, a declaration that makes it more difficult for TikTok to position itself and ByteDance as a global enterprise instead of a Chinese company. In 2020, the country had also come out in fierce opposition to executive orders by then President Donald Trump that sought to ban TikTok and the messaging app WeChat.""They were clear about their point of view back in 2020 timeframe when we faced an existential challenge from executive orders under the Trump administration,” Andersen said.Courts blocked Trump’s efforts, and President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s orders after taking office. The company has since been in talks about privacy concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multi-agency panel that sits under the Treasury department.Meanwhile, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been pushing bills that would effectively ban TikTok or give the administration more authority to do so. One bill by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley was blocked this week by Sen. Rand Paul, the only Republican who has come out in opposition to a TikTok ban. A small number of progressive lawmakers have also said they would oppose a ban, and argued the U.S. should implement a national privacy law to curtail the problem.Andersen said Friday TikTok would support broad-based privacy legislation.""Our view is that we would really welcome broad-based legislation that applies broadly and evenly,” he said. “What we don’t like, frankly, is legislation that is sort of targeted at one company.”TikTok could also be banned through another bill, called the RESTRICT Act, that has garnered broad bipartisan support in the Senate and backing from the White House. The legislation does not call out TikTok but would give the Commerce Department power to review and potentially restrict foreign threats to technology platforms.___This story has been updated to change Hewlett-Packard Foundation to Hewlett Foundation.]"

Shares of Micron, which counts on mainland China for about 11% of its sales, fell 4.4% in New York to $60.34. It was their worst one-day decline in more than three months.Boise, Idaho-based Micron said in a statement that it was in communication with the Cyberspace Administration of China concerning the inquiry and that the company is “cooperating fully. Micron is committed to conducting all business with uncompromising integrity, and we stand by the security of our products and our commitments to customers.”The world’s biggest economies increasingly see each other’s tech sectors as risks to national security. That has sent Washington rushing to secure its global supply chains and seeking to fence off advanced technology.The US has already blacklisted Chinese tech firms, sought to cut the flow of sophisticated processors and banned its citizens from providing certain help to the country’s chip industry.Washington has also enlisted allies, with Japan saying earlier on Friday that it will expand restrictions on exporting leading-edge chipmaking technology, joining similar US-led restrictions by another key supplier, the Netherlands. The move also comes as the US tries to play down the visit this week of Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, which Beijing has protested.Story continuesRead More: Japan Tightens Chip Gear Exports as US Seeks to Contain China“It’s possible that the investigation of Micron is intended to pressure the US and its allies to tread lightly on export controls,” said Gerard DiPippo, senior fellow with the Economics Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s even more likely that Beijing is legitimately worried about China’s reliance on Micron chips, or really any US technology. Expect more actions like this going forward.”The US State Department and Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment on the Chinese action.Tech BattleWashington last year unleashed strict export controls on semiconductor technologies to China, and has spent years targeting Huawei Technologies Co., a leader in telecommunications infrastructure that the US has deemed a national security threat with ties to the Chinese government.As well, US authorities have alleged that Micron was the victim of economic espionage by Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., which was blacklisted by Washington more than four years ago amid the accusations, which include it conspired to steal trade secrets from the American firm. A trial is expected later this year.“This seems more political in nature than anything, a rebuttal to recent US actions. In terms of specific security risks for the products sold by Micron, I’m skeptical there’s anything there,” said Abhinav Davuluri, equity strategist at Morningstar. “China has been investing aggressively to build out its own semiconductor ecosystem, and where we think about areas where they can be most successful, memory is one of them.”The Biden administration has been wielding the export control power of the Commerce Department, headed by Gina Raimondo, as one of its main tools to stifle China’s technological ambitions and bolster national security. The US includes more than 600 Chinese establishments on the Entity List, which blocks them from buying technology from US suppliers unless they get a special export license from Commerce.China’s review also comes as US lawmakers are weighing a ban on TikTok, the social-media platform owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., over fears of China’s ability to access the data of million of Americans and influence users. TikTok’s chief executive officer testified before Congress last week but failed to alleviate concerns.Industry SurvivorChina’s probe could threaten a potential comeback for Micron and other memory chipmakers after a rough stretch. Over the past year, a steep drop in consumer demand spurred Micron’s customers to slash orders. China’s exit from Covid-related restrictions was seen as one catalyst to help the industry, as gadget makers would be able to bring manufacturing plants back to normal rhythm.Earlier this week, Micron issued a better-than-expected outlook for the quarter, forecasting sales of as much as $3.9 billion in the fiscal third quarter compared with an average of analysts’ estimates of $3.75 billion. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra cited expectations for improvements in the balance of supply and demand in the industry.The company is the last remaining maker of computer memory based in the US, having survived brutal industry downturns that forced larger companies such as Intel Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. to bow out. The company has relatively little exposure to China compared with its peers, and it doesn’t use the country as a major manufacturing base.Micron’s revenue share from China is less than half that of Korean rival SK Hynix Inc. While the limited footprint stands to cushion Micron against any fallout, it could still exacerbate supply chain woes. Much of the world’s electronics and component systems come through factories in the world’s second-largest economy.“The biggest issue for Micron has been the global softness in consumer device sales,” said James Kelleher, analyst at Argus Research. “As that market recovers, it’s conceivable, if Micron were proscribed from selling to China, that they could make up lost sales in other markets. But it would affect them.”--With assistance from Gao Yuan, Eric Martin, Lucy Papachristou, Iain Marlow and Joel Rosenblatt.(Updates Micron shares in third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsXi Jinping Launches a Charm Offensive to Repair China’s Tattered ImageThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsA Giant Rail Merger Escapes Washington’s Big Deal Crackdown©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

It's not worth the risk of further destabilization to the banking system.""Traders' bets of a 25-basis-point rate hike in May stand at 53.8%, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool, with rate cuts also expected this year.Story continuesBoston Fed PresidentSusan Collinsnoted that it was still early for the central bank to assess whether its rate hikes have gone far enough to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target.As U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dipped following the inflation data, major growth names like Apple Inc, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Tesla gained between 0.5% and 4% on Friday.Limiting gains, Micron Technology dropped 2.7% after news that China was set to review the chipmaker's products sold in the country.The broader Philadelphia semiconductor index fell marginally on Friday but is up 27% on the quarter, with Nvidia as the top boost after gaining 87%.At 11:57 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 244.35 points, or 0.74%, at 33,103.38, the S&amp;P 500 was up 34.46 points, or 0.85%, at 4,085.29, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 131.40 points, or 1.09%, at 12,144.87.Companies linked to Donald Trump such as Digital World Acquisition Corp and Phunware Inc jumped 6.6% and 9.8% respectively, amid retail investor interest, a day after the former president was indicted in a historic first.Shares of Nikola Corp tumbled 11.0% after the electric truck maker said it plans to sell shares and raise $100 million. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.73-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.76-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&amp;P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 57 new highs and 98 new lows.(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Ankika Biswas; additional reporting by Johann M Cherian Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Maju Samuel)]"

If you want to see more best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years, go directly to 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years.There are different definitions for growth stocks. For this article, we define high growth as a stock with an EPS next 5 year ratio of over 10%.Considering a stock can have a high EPS next 5 year ratio by starting off with a small profit base, the best growth stocks also have other compelling characteristics such as competitive advantages, long term growth potential, and ideally a history of profitability. For those of you interested, check out 12 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable.In terms of the next 5 years, one of the biggest growth sectors will likely be AI given how transformative the technology could be.According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI alone could eventually increase global GDP by 7%. Specifically, analysts at the investment bank said, ""The boost to global labor productivity could also be economically significant, and we estimate that AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%"" although the exact timing and the exact effect size could be difficult to estimate according to the analysts.To put the 7% number into perspective, global GDP was $96.53 trillion in 2021 according to The World Bank. According to Statista, the global economy had a GDP of $101.6 trillion in 2022, the first time it surpassed $100 trillion. 7% of $101.6 trillion would be $7.11 trillion, larger than the nominal GDP of Japan. For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.While the vast majority of the increase in global GDP will benefit various firms throughout the global economy by allowing them to create more goods and services, the leading tech companies that have invested tens of billions into AI and that have one of the three largest cloud computing businesses could also benefit from more demand as well.Story continuesGiven how fast the AI sector is developing, it is very difficult to pick exact stocks that will do well. One company can lag behind others for a variety of reasons. If the sector is winner take all, there could really only be one or a few companies that do well.Given the sector is so uncertain, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Computer, memory, processorPhoto by Liam Briese on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years, we chose 12 stocks with competitive advantages that have an EPS next 5 year ratios of over 10% according to FINVIZ.com.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.We also included Amazon.com, Inc.

In January 2023, it increased the annual dividend by 4% to $1.04 per share from $1, marking the utility’s 312th consecutive quarterly and 56th consecutive annual dividend hike. This resulted in a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share.HeadwindsThe utility operates in a highly regulated environment and any changes in existing laws and conditions could increase the operating costs. Also, there’s no assurance that the commission would approve rate increases to enable the recovery of these additional compliance costs. These factors, in unison, can have an adverse impact on the company’s business.The aging water infrastructure is another concern for California Water. Any addition or improvement in the existing water infrastructure requires huge capital investments. If the company fails to procure the required capital at a desirable rate, it could hamper its operations.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the same sector are Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, NiSource, Inc.

ANGO reported an adjusted loss per share of 3 cents for third-quarter fiscal 2023 against the year-ago earnings per share (EPS) of 3 cents. The loss per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny per share.Our projection of adjusted loss per share was also a penny, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.GAAP loss per share came in at 24 cents, wider than the year-over-year loss of 13 cents per share.Revenue DetailsRevenues in the fiscal third quarter totaled $80.7 million, up 9.1% year over year on a reported basis (up 9.4% at constant exchange rate or CER). The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.The fiscal third-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $82.3 million.The company continued to see strong contributions from its Med Tech (which include the Auryon peripheral atherectomy platform, the thrombus management platform and the NanoKnife irreversible electroporation platform) and Med Device businesses during the quarter.Geographical AnalysisIn the quarter under review, U.S. net revenues totaled $67.6 million, up 8.3% year over year.This figure compares to our U.S. net revenues’ fiscal third-quarter projection of $69.5 million.International revenues came in at $13.1 million, up 13.6% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and up 15.2% at CER.This figure compares to our fiscal third-quarter International revenues’ projection of $12.8 million.Segmental AnalysisAngioDynamics derives revenues from two businesses — Med Tech and Med Device.The Med Tech business’ net sales in the fiscal third quarter were $ 22.9 million, reflecting an uptick of 16.6% year over year. This was primarily on the back of increased net sales of Auryon amounting to $10.4 million (up 42.8%), NanoKnife sales of $4.1 million (up 5.4%) and NanoKnife disposable sales of $3.5 million (up 22.2%) compared with the prior-year quarter. AlphaVac sales in the reported quarter were $2 million. However, the improvement in the Med Tech segment was partially offset by a decline of 15.7% in AngioVac sales which amounted to $5.5 million in the quarter.Story continuesThis figure compares to our fiscal third quarter’s Med Tech business’ net sales projection of $24.5 million.Med Device revenues in the fiscal third quarter grossed $57.8 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago period. This was primarily driven by growth in angiographic catheters, ports, dialysis catheters and microwave products.This figure compares to our fiscal third quarter’s Med Device business’ net sales projection of $57.8 million, which matched the company-reported figures.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAngioDynamics, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | AngioDynamics, Inc. Quote Margin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AngioDynamics’ gross profit rose 4.9% to $40.5 million. However, the gross margin contracted 198 basis points to 50.2%.We had projected 52.6% of gross margin for third-quarter fiscal 2023.Sales and marketing expenses rose 24.4% to $25.4 million year over year. Research and development expenses decreased 5.9% year over year to $6.9 million, whereas general and administrative expenses rose 1.3% year over year to $8.8 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $41.1 million increased 12.8% year over year.The adjusted operating loss totaled $0.6 million against the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating profit of $2.2 million.Cash PositionAngioDynamics exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $30.1 million compared with $29.9 million at the end of the fiscal second quarter. The long-term debt (net of current portion) at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023 was $49.8 million, flat compared with that at the end of the fiscal second quarter.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities came in at $ 15.9 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $15.8 million a year ago.FY23 GuidanceAngioDynamics has lowered its guidance for fiscal 2023 due to its lower-than-expected AngioVac sales.The company now expects its net sales in the range of $338 million-$342 million, lowered from its earlier projection of $342-$348 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $342.9 million.The adjusted loss per share is now projected to be between 6 cents and a penny, against its earlier projections of adjusted EPS of a penny and 6 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is currently pegged at EPS of a penny.Our TakeAngioDynamics registered a solid year-over-year uptick in its overall top line and domestic and international revenues, which are impressive. The company continued gaining from its Med Tech and Med Device businesses, which is promising. Robust sales of Auryon and NanoKnife look encouraging. Positive physician feedback for AlphaVac products, including the F22 and F18 versions, raises optimism.During the fiscal third quarter, AngioDynamics confirmed that it continues to execute its clinical trials, including three investigational device exemption studies — the PRESERVE study for the treatment of prostate cancer with NanoKnife, the APEX study for the treatment of pulmonary embolism with its AlphaVac F18 and the DIRECT study for the treatment of pancreatic cancer with NanoKnife. This raises optimism regarding the stock.However, AngioDynamics’ lower-than-expected results and dismal bottom-line performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 are disappointing. Lower revenues from AngioVac sales and a decline in the company’s EVLT business of the Med Device segment during the quarter were also concerning.The gross margin contraction does not bode well for the stock. AngioDynamics lowering its financial outlook due to lower-than-anticipated AngioVac sales and higher inflationary pressure than previously expected also raises apprehension.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that are supposed to report earnings soon are Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

The research involves collaboration among PPL Corporation subsidiaries Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company (LG&amp;E and KU); independent, non-profit energy R&amp;D institute EPRI; and the University of Kentucky (UK). Engineering, construction and project management company Bechtel and the University of Michigan are also participating.The carbon capture research project, funded primarily by a $5.8 million grant from the Department of Energy in 2022, involves LG&amp;E and KU's natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) facility, located at Cane Run Generating Station in Louisville, Ky. The NGCC, known as CR7, has been in operation since 2015 and is one of just two NGCCs in the country awarded DOE research funding. The project entails a front-end engineering design (FEED) study to evaluate the feasibility and approximate cost to pilot and deploy the University of Kentucky-developed carbon-capture technology on CR7 to capture at least 95% of carbon dioxide from gases exiting the unit's stacks.CR7 is representative of NGCC power plants in the Midwest and Midsouth where geographical storage for carbon dioxide is limited. The results of the CR7 project are expected to yield valuable information relevant to retrofitting a carbon-capture process on other NGCC units.The study will lay the groundwork for a full-scale, 10-to-20-megawatt carbon capture sequestration pilot unit at Cane Run. If the unit is deployed as proposed by the group's FEED study, it would be the first of its kind in the world.""As part of our commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, decarbonization technology is a key focus area for our utilities and others across the energy industry with similar goals,"" said LG&amp;E and KU President John R. Crockett. ""We've been involved in leading carbon capture research for nearly 20 years and believe the experience we bring, along with our partners' innovation, will play a critical role in advancing this technology.""Story continues""Demonstrating emerging technology at scale is a critical step in the journey from concept to commercialization,"" said Neva Espinoza, vice president, Energy Supply and Low-Carbon Resources at EPRI. ""This foundational research has the potential to shed new light on the potential for carbon capture technology in Kentucky and help inform clean energy development around the world.""""This research will ultimately enable us to complete all of the assessments needed, scale up our existing carbon capture technology and move to a fully-functioning, utility-scale operation that would be able to sell the carbon captured to one or more local businesses for their needs, or permanently store it underground,"" said Kunlei Liu, associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UK.The FEED study will take place from now through mid-2024 and involves pre-FEED research by the University of Kentucky focused on the project scope and design among other factors; the FEED itself conducted by Bechtel; commercial, environmental and economic assessments performed by EPRI; and a life-cycle assessment performed by the University of Michigan.This federal award for the study is the largest won by LG&amp;E and KU since 2011, when the same team — UK, EPRI, and LG&amp;E and KU — won an award for a carbon capture pilot at the utilities' E.W. Brown Generating Station.The research is also another milestone in the longtime partnership between UK, and LG&amp;E and KU. The two have partnered on carbon capture research since 2005; built and operate Kentucky's largest carbon capture system at E.W. Brown since 2014; and, in partnership with the utilities' parent company, PPL, and the PPL Research and Development Center based out of KU headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky, continue to innovate in decarbonization, hydrogen and other technologies.Learn more about LG&amp;E and KU's innovative projects at lge-ku.com/research.About LG&amp;E and KU:Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, part of the PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) family of companies, are regulated utilities that serve more than 1.3 million customers and have consistently ranked among the best companies for customer service in the United States.

The company's Neighbor's Club membership program and strong demand for its products bode well. It is also focusing on expanding its store base and distribution center by incorporating technological advancements to increase traffic and drive top-line growth.Neighbor's Club Program: Key FactorTractor Supply relaunched its Neighbor's Club program in April 2021 to improve its operating capabilities. Since its relaunch, the company has added about 50% more high-value clients. These valuable clients spend more money and shop more frequently, which boost sales of the company.TSCO announced its fiscal 2022 results, wherein net sales increased 11.6% to $14.2 billion. According to the company, the Neighbor's Club Program contributed 75% of sales in the fiscal year and the program’s membership exceeded 28 million members.The company also announced the expansion of the Neighbor's Club program with Petsense, one of the brands under TSCO. This expansion will deepen the relationship with existing customers and help attract new pet customers. The company noted that the Neighbor's Club membership represented approximately 50% of sales at Petsense. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What Else is Driving Growth?Tractor Supply is on track to build a distribution center in Arkansas to support its expansion of the supply chain and higher volumes in its existing stores. Post completion of its new distribution center in late 2023, management expects to generate 500 full-time jobs and service about 300 stores at full capacity. On Jan 18, 2023, management also launched its largest and ninth distribution center in Navarre, OH.Earlier, the company launched the field activity support team (FAST) and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise. FAST has made powerful contributions in the company’s in-stock performance and execution of its sales-driving initiatives.Given the changing consumer trends, Tractor Supply is focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience.The company is on track with the ONETractor strategy to connect stores and online shopping. Its e-commerce business witnessed mid-single-digit growth from the prior year. As of the year-end, the Tractor Supply app has had more than 4.4 million downloads since its launch.TSCO’s store expansion initiatives bode well. It is well-positioned to expand its store base. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company opened 39 Tractor Supply stores and six Petsense stores. In the said quarter, the company acquired 81 stores from Orscheln Farm and Home that will be rebranded to Tractor Supply by the end of 2023. Management is on track with its store-opening initiatives. It plans to open 70 Tractor Supply stores and 10-15 Petsense stores in 2023.Driven by these factors, management announced a compelling guidance for fiscal 2023. The view reflects the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, and the cost for new distribution center. The company expects net sales of $15.0-$15.3 billion, up from the $14.20 billion reported in the prior period. Comps are likely to grow 3.5-5.5% on a year-over-year basis. The operating margin is anticipated to be 10.1%-10.3%. Earnings per share are likely to be $10.30-$10.60, up from the $9.71 reported in the previous period.Story continuesWrapping upTractor Supply has been facing challenging macro environment factors for a while now. Additionally, the company has noticed cost pressures throughout the supply chain. Management anticipates transportation costs to continue to rise year over year in the first quarter of 2023, with a recovery in the second half of 2023.Nonetheless, the advantages mentioned above will most likely assist Tractor Supply in overcoming such obstacles.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 7.7% in the past three months compared with the industry's 2.5% growth.3 Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks are Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc.

Overall, the S&amp;P 500 finished the first quarter up 7% and rose for the second-straight quarter, which Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees as the start of something bigger for markets.Former President Donald Trump's indictment late Thursday also didn't move markets, but will be carefully watched for implications on the looming debt ceiling debate this summer and 2024 election, pros say.""At this point, the view that Trump could benefit from his legal troubles has almost become conventional wisdom, to the extent that 'actually it is bad to be indicted' is now a contrarian take,"" said Evercore ISI strategist Tobin Marcus.""But we have been making this argument since last summer, and we still believe it. We maintain our view that Trump is a strong frontrunner for the GOP nomination.""But with first quarter earnings season right around the corner and the start of the second quarter coming up on Monday, let's set 2024 aside for now and go through a few other key items that caught Yahoo Finance's attention this week.1. Foot Locker runs into its futureSome seven months into the CEO job at Foot Locker (FL), Mary Dillon told me at Shoptalk in Las Vegas this week she is trying to ensure the company is around for the next 50 years to serve sneakerheads.""We are the OG of sneakers and are really refocusing on all things sneakers,"" Dillon said.The Foot Locker store in Broomfield, Colorado is seen November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Rick WilkingDillon has wasted no time in outlining her goals to Wall Street and repairing a damaged relationship with Nike (NKE), as we noted earlier this week. Given Dillon's impressive eight-year track track record as CEO of Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker investors should rest assured they have a top flight leader.Story continuesYou can read more on what we learned at Shoptalk here.Stat Share: Foot Locker shares are up 8% since Dillon was announced as CEO in late August 2022, out-performing the S&amp;P 500's 2.1% drop.2. Lyft hails a new CEOAfter a series of bad quarters amid market share losses to larger rival Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) has ordered a new leader for its corner office.With the stock down 77% in the past year, the move to replace co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer operationally at least wasn't a total shock to Wall Street (both will stay on the board).Enter Amazon- and Microsoft-trained David Risher, who has also been a Lyft board member for about 18 months. Risher told Yahoo Finance Live he is focused on getting back to basics at Lyft, which may include further expense cuts.Risher also didn't rule out a sale of Lyft at some point.""We always look at options and people approach us from time to time. Right now our focus is on creating such a great service that in whatever configuration, we are going to be relevant — valuable — either as a standalone company or something else,"" Risher said.Stat Share: Lyft investors will have to wait to for Risher's operational magic honed at Amazon and Microsoft — he doesn't officially start as Lyft's CEO until April 17.3.

257,fc298b22-90a1-38a1-a019-a74aa0cc0a79,ULTA,2023-04-01,"Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-soars-131501100.html,1680268501,STORY,"['ULTA', 'BBW']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2.9% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $538.3 in the previous session. Ulta Beauty has gained 14.4% since the start of the year compared to the 6.6% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 8.4% return for the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on March 9, 2023, Ulta reported EPS of $6.68 versus consensus estimate of $5.69.For the current fiscal year, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $25.21 per share on $11.07 billion in revenues. This represents a 5% change in EPS on an 8.46% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $27.22 per share on $11.66 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 7.97% and 5.32%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUlta may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Ulta has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 12.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.4X versus its peer group's average of 6.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.73. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ulta currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ulta fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Ulta shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does ULTA Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ULTA have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (BBW). BBW has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 16.07%, and for the current fiscal year, BBW is expected to post earnings of $3.46 per share on revenue of $497.12 million.Shares of Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. have gained 10.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 6.57X and a P/CF of 7.34X.The Retail - Miscellaneous industry is in the top 22% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ULTA and BBW, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in the backlog till December 2022.Looking ahead, LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond.

So far, more than 9 million gallons (34 million liters) of wastewater have been removed from the site and hauled to hazardous waste storage sites in Ohio and other states, according to the state officials.Government officials say tests haven’t found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area, but many residents remain concerned about their long-term health.The Ohio Department of Natural Resources said three weeks after the disaster that the spilled contaminants killed an estimated 44,000 fish, mostly small ones such as minnows.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw has repeatedly apologized for the impact the derailment and the company has pledged to pay for the cleanup. The railroad has promised so far to spend close to $28 million to help the Ohio community recover while also announcing several voluntary safety upgrades.Connor Spielmaker, a spokesperson for Norfolk Southern, said the company is focused on the cleanup and working at the direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.“Our job right now is to make progress every day cleaning up the site, assisting residents whose lives were impacted by the derailment, and investing in the future of East Palestine and the surrounding areas,” he said in a statement.Ohio filed a lawsuit against Norfolk Southern just over two weeks ago to make sure it pays for the cleanup and environmental damage, and pays for groundwater and soil monitoring in the years ahead.]"

268,8e707728-966e-3522-9bd2-708745f2ec08,KO,2023-04-01,Returns On Capital At Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Have Hit The Brakes,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-coca-cola-nyse-110032169.html,1680346832,STORY,['KO'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$12b ÷ (US$93b - US$20b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 17%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Beverage industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Coca-Cola compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Coca-Cola's ROCE Trend?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 17% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 20% in that time. Since 17% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.What We Can Learn From Coca-Cola's ROCEThe main thing to remember is that Coca-Cola has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 65% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesLike most companies, Coca-Cola does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.While Coca-Cola isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Its shares plummeted more than 20% on the news, bottoming at $162.71 in mid-May. In the 10 and a half months since, the stock has nearly doubled in price as the company saw subscriber growth resume.Higher share prices tend to follow subscriber growth. The trick is finding companies whose subscriber growth is consistently higher. They don’t have to be higher 100% of the time, but they should be up on a year-over-year basis and sequentially most of the time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo help me choose three growth stocks with loyal customer bases, I’ll lean on the Fount Subscription Economy ETF (NYSEARCA:SUBS), a collection of approximately 50 stocks that benefit from the subscription economy. To be included in the fund, at least half of a company’s revenue must come from subscription-related services or products.My selections are in the ETF’s top holdings, ranking 9th, 11th and 13th, respectively. They’re all large-capitalization growth stocks. TMUST-Mobile$142.79ADBEAdobe$373.40INTUIntuit$419.33T-Mobile (TMUS)the exterior of a T-Mobile (TMUS) branded storeSource: Tupungato / Shutterstock.comT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) made headlines recently when it announced that it would pay up to $1.35 billion in cash and stock for the parent company of Mint Mobile, the discount wireless brand that actor Ryan Reynolds invested in during 2019. Lending his handsome face and charm to Mint Mobile’s ads, Reynolds helped grow its subscriber base. In the 12 months after Reynolds bought in, downloads of the Mint Mobile app increased by 34%, Fortune reports. The same analyst said the app’s monthly active users were up 82% year over year in February and 254% over February 2021.Wisely, T-Mobile will continue to use Reynolds as a brand ambassador for Mint Mobile. The celebrity is expected to make as much as $300 million from the sale. Story continuesT-Mobile is currently the third-largest mobile carrier in the United States after Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). In April 2022, I argued that T-Mobile had the right stuff to take market share from the other major wireless carriers. The latest deal certainly accelerates the company’s efforts to do so.  “Mint has built an incredibly successful digital direct-to-consumer business that continues to deliver for customers on the Un-carrier’s leading 5G network and now we are excited to use our scale and owners’ economics to help supercharge it — and Ultra Mobile — into the future,” said T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mike Sievert.T-Mobile added 6.4 million postpaid customers in 2022, its eighth consecutive year leading the industry in growth. With the purchase of Mint Mobile, T-Mobile is getting a business that provides discount pricing to its customer base while managing to generate profits. As it applies its marketing muscle to all three brands acquired, T-Mobile ought to be able to challenge AT&amp;T and Verizon for the top carrier crown.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.comWho knows how long Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) can go without laying off employees when it seems more tech companies are cutting their workforces every week. A recent article in Fortune shines some light on the situation: So, how did Adobe avoid mass layoffs? A pivot to remote and hybrid work environments during the pandemic created a “robust demand” for technology solutions and digital capabilities, [Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Dan] Durn explains. “But we didn’t get out over our skis in terms of hiring an unusual amount of people,” he says. So, in this now “true demand environment,” Adobe doesn’t have more talent than it ultimately needs, he says.Adobe reported earnings in mid-March that beat analyst estimates and raised its full-year outlook, citing strong demand for digital content creation tools. In 2022, it grew its Creative Cloud subscribers by nearly 30 million, with a run rate of approximately 1 million new subscriptions per quarter. Of course, the hottest thing since sliced bread right now is artificial intelligence (AI) tools. To that end, the company recently released an AI beta version of its Firefly art generator. The editing software’s AI tools allow content creators to improve photos and videos more easily. Interestingly, a vital feature of the generative AI software is the “Do Not Train” tag that allows content creators to tag projects so Adobe can’t use the content for model training. The use of AI-generated images has been rife with copyright issues since AI art models appeared on the scene in recent years. Finally, Adobe continues to work with regulators to get approval for its $20 billion acquisition of Figma, which provides a collaborative prototype design tool.  Intuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.Source: Julio Ricco / ShutterstockIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) provides financial management and compliance products and services to more than 100 million customers worldwide. These include popular tax preparation software TurboTax and accounting software QuickBooks.The company reported its latest quarterly results on Feb. 23. Revenue was up 14% year over year to $3.04 billion while operating income rose 40% to $856 million. In particular, Intuit’s small business and self-employed segment saw revenue jump 20% to $1.9 billion. This is Intuit’s largest segment, accounting for 62.5% of revenue and 68% of its operating profit.  For fiscal 2023, ending April 30, Intuit expects the small business and self-employed segment to see revenue growth of 19% to 20%, helping boost overall revenue by 8% to 9%.Contributing to the company’s recent growth are its live versions of TurboTax and QuickBooks, which it developed to increase customer engagement. They allow consumers and small-business owners to connect with financial professionals immediately to get their questions answered. And on Feb. 23, Intuit launched live services for TurboTax’s Spanish-speaking customers, providing another avenue for growth. “The U.S. Latino population has become the largest growth minority group in the nation and there is no doubt of their influence on today’s economy,” said Cathleen Ryan, senior vice president of marketing for Intuit TurboTax. “TurboTax is committed to understanding their needs and providing in-language and in-culture products and resources that can guide Latino taxpayers through their tax filing experience with confidence and with the support they deserve.”Given that Hispanic entrepreneurs are starting small businesses at a much faster rate than non-Hispanic entrepreneurs, Intuit is wise to focus on this demographic.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance, along with the acquisition of dialysis centers, is expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding the dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 30.5% compared with the 20.1% decline of the industry and an 11.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $7.18 billion. The company projects 8.4% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, the average surprise being 2.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Dec 31, 2022, the company had approximately 42,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing $3.5 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses, which own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary services, is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.As of Dec 31, 2022, DaVita provided dialysis services at 3,074 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,724 were U.S. centers, while 350 were located across 11 other countries. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company opened six dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired three and opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: DaVita’s solid fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its Other revenues during the period. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and the opening of others, within the United States and overseas, were also recorded.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 8.2% south to $5.93.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.83 billion, suggesting a 0.4% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our first-quarter revenue estimate of $2.83 billion, which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Henry Schein, Inc. HSIC and Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Trane Technologies basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Trane Technologies, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Trane TechnologiesThis manufacturer is expected to earn $8.23 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 11.8%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Trane Technologies. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.9%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Trane Technologies to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The LOI includes exploring a potential long-term strategic partnership to extract and recycle plastics out of incineration waste streams. This proposed collaboration would potentially include construction of waste pre-sorting facilities at or near EEW incineration plants to remove plastics from waste streams bound for incineration, and investment in advanced sorting facilities to further sort and refine the plastic that has been removed. This collaboration supports the new LyondellBasell strategy to invest in advanced sorting infrastructure to produce plastic waste-based feedstocks, grow its Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business, and deliver on its value creation ambitions.""Collaborations across the value chain are part of our strategy and are increasingly necessary to free up plastic waste from sources that today do not end up in recycling,"" says Yvonne van der Laan, LyondellBasell executive vice president, Circular and Low Carbon Solutions. ""The materials from these sorting facilities would not only support our existing mechanical recycling facilities in the Netherlands and a potential advanced recycling unit in Germany, but also allows us to optimize waste streams and drive additional value.""This collaboration would close the loop on plastics that are today sent for incineration, by sorting them out for use as feedstock in mechanical and advance recycling processes. By removing these materials from the incineration waste stream, the fossil CO2 emissions associated with combusting the materials are also avoided.""With this cooperation, we are creating a convincing solution for plastic waste for which recycling is still ruled out today,"" says Bernard M. Kemper, chief executive officer EEW Energy from Waste. ""EEW will first build a sorting facility and sort out plastics to recover them for the raw material cycle.""Story continuesThe intended cooperation represents an advancement in recycling opportunities, using the sites and technical know-how of LyondellBasell and EEW to enable a sustainable circular economy.About LyondellBasellAs a leader in the global chemical industry, LyondellBasell strives every day to be the safest, best operated and most valued company in our industry.

279,5d63ccb5-bcf0-30da-9a57-6c2038e4a55b,LYB,2023-04-01,5 High-Yield Stocks for March 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-high-yield-stocks-march-191900113.html,1680031140,STORY,"['VZ', 'BBY', 'AROW', 'BKH', 'LYB']","[An old proverb states, “Mach comes in like a lion, out like a lamb.” It refers to the weather. But it can be applied to the stock market in March 2023.The failure of two regional banks related to tech and cryptocurrency startups has caused turmoil. The government took over SVB Financial’s Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) when it could not raise capital to cover a balance sheet deficit. The firm had greater exposure to people working in startups and venture capital. They withdrew cash from accounts, and SVB sold bonds at a loss to cover the outflows. Signature Bank was also shuttered because of its exposure to cryptocurrencies and withdrawal of deposits.Because of contagion fears, investors have sold bank stocks and bank exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially regional banks. At the same time, they have sold the broader market. But the selling is probably overdone, and many companies do not have the same exposure to riskier assets. So this indiscriminate selling presents an opportunity for brave investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBelow, we discuss five high-yield dividend growth stocks with solid dividend safety for March 2023.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockI have written about Verizon (NYSE:VZ) before, but market action has again driven the stock price down and dividend yield up over 7%. Few stocks offer this high dividend combined with dividend growth, safety and undervaluation. That said, Verizon has its challenges with retail cellular subscriber dividend growth.But statements by the CEO imply the trend may have started to reverse the trend in 2023. In addition, Verizon is reducing capital spending and cutting expenses after two years of elevated levels.Market action has caused the dividend yield to reach 7.1%, just shy of the highest in the past decade and about 2.5% more than the five-year average. Verizon is a Dividend Contender, with 19 years of increases. The growth is remarkably consistent at about 2% annually. The dividend is supported by a payout ratio of only about 50%. Moreover, it receives a dividend quality grade of B+ and a stable investment-grade credit rating.Story continuesVerizon is undervalued based on historical metrics. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only about 7.9x, well beneath the five-year and 10-year ranges. Hence, Verizon is an excellent choice for investors seeking income.Best Buy (BBY)The front view of a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) retail location in Indianapolis, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) earns an unlikely place on this list. But the stock is a dividend growth one with a nice yield and excellent dividend safety.The company is one of North America’s largest electronics and services retailers. Best Buy sells consumer electronics, personal computers, software, mobile devices and appliances and provides services through its 1,100+ stores. In addition, the firm acquired YardBird, expanding into outdoor furniture. The company’s annual sales exceeded $46.3 billion in fiscal 2023.Best Buy has increased its dividend for 20 years. The declining stock price has increased the dividend yield to nearly 5%. Moreover, dividend safety is excellent, with a payout ratio of about 50% and a net cash position on the balance sheet.The company trades at a P/E ratio of around 8x, below the five-year range. In addition, investors expect little from the company because of the downturn in electronics spending after the pandemic. But we view Best Buy as an acceptable choice for investors seeking a retailer to add to their passive income portfolio.Black Hills (BKH)multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skyline. AQN stockSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.comBlack Hills Corporation (NYSE:BKH) is a diversified utility. It transmits and distributes electricity to roughly 220,000 customers and natural gas to about 1,107,000 customers. The firm generates approximately 1,482 megawatts of power and has several natural gas storage sites. The utility company had revenue of about $2,552 million in 2022.The company is a Dividend King and has raised the dividend for 53 years, making it only one of three electric and natural gas utilities on the list. The dividend yield is now over 4% and growing at about 5% annually. The dividend safety is excellent, with a payout ratio of only about 61%, low for a utility. Also, the dividend quality grade is an A, meaning it is in the 90th percentile.The stock market decline has made Black Hills’ stock undervalued. The forward P/E ratio is now approximately 15x, below the five-year and 10-year ranges. Investors seeking a high-yield utility stock should consider Black Hills.LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB)A LyondellBasell production plant in Wesseling, Germany is seen at dusk.Source: Flagmania / Shutterstock.comLyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) is a global chemical and refining company. It has six business units: Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas; Olefins and Polyolefins – Europe, Asia, International; Intermediates and Derivatives; Advanced Polymer Solutions; Refining; and Technology.The company operates in a cyclical industry. But on average, revenue and earnings per share (EPS) have grown over the past decade. However, the firm now faces headwinds from higher input costs and lower demand.That said, the firm is conservative, with its dividend payout at 38%. The balance sheet is strong, too, with a leverage ratio of about 1.7x and interest coverage of 17x. This safety combined with a dividend yield of nearly 5.5% makes the stock interesting for those seeking income. In addition, the dividend has been increased for 12 straight years at an annualized rate of about 5.8%.LyndellBasell is probably fairly valued at the moment. But investors seeking to diversify their dividend growth stock portfolio with a higher-yielding stock should consider LyondellBasell.Arrow Financial Corporation (AROW)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it.Source: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockThe last stock on this list is Arrow Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:AROW), a small community bank founded in 1851. With a market capitalization of only $419 million, the bank is too small to be considered a regional bank. Furthermore, the bank operates in upstate New York and is not focused on tech startups and cryptocurrency.Instead, Arrow Financial is a holding company providing consumer and commercial banking, insurance and wealth management.Arrow Financial is a Dividend Champion with a 30-year streak of dividend increases. The almost 21% decline in the stock price has pushed the dividend yield to over 4%. The payout ratio is modest at about 36%. The bank increases the dividend at a mid-single-digit rate.The bank is trading below its trailing five-year and 10-year P/E ratio range at about 8.5x. As a result, investors seeking some diversification may want to examine Arrow Financial.On the date of publication, Prakash Kolli held a LONG position in VZ.

The license allowed the company to expand oil production there and export it. Refiners, including Valero, have bought cargoes from Chevron.However, Chevron’s resumption of Venezuela crude imports has not led to an increase in the country’s overall exports this year. In February, the company exported some 86,000 barrels per day of Venezuela crude oil.The U.S. trading sanctions were first imposed on Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA in 2019. Before this, Valero was among the top receivers of the South American country’s crude through long-term supply contracts.Valero is seeking the Treasury Department’s permission for sanctions relief, allowing it to directly purchase crude oil from PDVSA. However, no decision is likely to occur soon, implying that the U.S. does not want further easing of Venezuela sanctions until president Nicolas Maduro makes political concessions to Venezuela’s opposition.Price PerformanceShares of Valero have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

The employee must possess the legal authority to represent the deceased person and the close one can either be the Beneficiary, Executor of the Estate or Beneficiary Representative.The other benefits of the service include  assistance in getting hold of death certificate copies and round-the-clock information as well as guidance from dedicated Beneficiary Assistance Coordinators. Meanwhile, the coordinators will inform the Social Security Administration, credit reporting agencies, credit card companies and other financial institutions about the passing away of the loved one.The Beneficiary Companion facility that Aflac has integrated within its product aims to provide personalized service and attempts to reduce the stress that individuals inevitably undergo in case of the death of a loved one. Several intricate administrative details requiring extensive paperwork and chances of identity theft often crop up in the case of deceased Americans. Amid a pensive scenario, getting access to the highly useful Beneficiary Companion service is expected to ease the decision-making process of employees while settling the final affairs post the death of a loved one.The recent tie-up seems to be a timely move on part of Aflac, considering the workplace costs arising after the death of an employee’s loved one that have to be borne by employers. Per the Grief Recovery Institute, the cost of workplace grief following an employee’s close one’s death is anticipated at $37.5 billion per year.  The need for a facility to address the problem of identity theft of deceased people is dire since the identity information of around 2.5 million deceased Americans is compromised every year (according to AARP). Story continuesThe recent product enhancement bears testament to Aflac’s consistent efforts to boost its supplemental health insurance offerings. It also reflects AFL’s sincere endeavor to impart physical, financial and mental well-being to its policyholders and beneficiaries. Integrating lucrative features, such as the Beneficiary Companion service, within its product offerings might lure more employers to opt for AFL’s products and extend them to their workforce. This, in turn, might solidify the insurer’s presence across the United States.Shares of Aflac have gained 11.1% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 7% growth.

291,62f176dc-accd-3758-838e-72d84bad0828,AFL,2023-04-01,7 Quirky Companies That Consistently Beat The Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-quirky-companies-consistently-beat-151756321.html,1680016676,STORY,"['CROX', 'SAIC', 'WWE', 'AFL', 'DDS']","[Not every publicly traded company is straight-laced and easy to understand. Many companies have taken an unorthodox approach on the road to success. Whether it is a niche business, a strange origin story, or an odd founder, some of the best-performing stocks in the world have been issued by organizations that can best be described as “quirky.” And different doesn’t necessarily equate to bad when it comes to founding and running a company. Many of the most successful companies in history were started by people who consider themselves to be oddballs and outsiders, from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to Elon Musk and Richard Branson. Taking a quirky or different approach to running a business often leads to disruption, outperformance, and, ultimately, dominance. In this article, we celebrate the offbeat by looking at seven quirky stocks that beat the market.AFLAflac$64.34DDSDillard’s$301BRK.A/BRK.BBerkshire Hathaway$460,000/$304CROXCrocs$123.40WWEWorld Wrestling Entertainment$91.60SAICScience Applications International$107BRCCBlack Rifle Coffee$5.08Quirky Companies: AFLAC (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comSupplemental insurance company AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) is about as quirky as insurance companies get. The company’s mascot is a quaking duck, and, like a 1980s era rock band, the firm is huge in Japan. Currently, about 70% of Georgia-based AFLAC’s annual revenue comes from the Japanese market.Why? It turns out that Japan’s employer-sponsored insurance benefits are not as robust as in the U.S., nor is the government-funded healthcare system as comprehensive as in countries such as Canada. As a result, many Japanese citizens buy supplemental health-and-life insurance policies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhat’s fascinating is how AFLAC grew its business in Japan. Entering the market in 1974, AFLAC employed what it called “insurance ladies” that were modeled on Avon’s “cosmetic ladies.” These were women who literally knocked on people’s doors, selling supplemental insurance policies. In the 1990s, AFLAC further grew its market share in Japan by selling insurance policies via the mail and was one of the first insurers to go online in the country. The result is that today, the majority of AFLAC’s revenue is generated in Japan.Story continuesAFL stock has been a consistent outperformer over the years. Since the 2008-09 financial crisis, the company’s share price has risen more than 650%.Dillard’s (DDS)A photo of the exterior of a Dillard's DDS store with the company logo above the entrance.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comThe Wall Street Journal recently profiled  Dillard’s (NYSE:DDS), a department-store chain, highlighting its many eccentricities and noting that its stock has outperformed many popular tech companies, including both Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) since the pandemic occurred in 2020.One of the things that sets Dillard’s apart from other department stores is the fact that its daily operations continue to be run by the original Dillard family. The company currently has about 280 stores, most of which are concentrated in the southern U.S., primarily in Texas and Florida.Brothers William and Alex Dillard continue to run the company and preach old-fashioned values that include careful debt management, measured growth, and employee loyalty. The brothers reportedly still visit stores on a weekly basis to see which products are selling well.Many of the staff at the department stores have worked for the company for decades. And, unlike most other retailers, Dillard’s has not focused on bolstering its online sales. Instead, the company prioritizes giving shoppers in-person attention. While this approach may seem to go against the grain, there’s no arguing with the results.DDS stock has gained more than 1,500% since April 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. The company’s market value is now on par with that of Macy’s (NYSE:M), although Dillard’s has less than a third of Macy’s annual revenue. The brothers’ prudent approach led Dillard’s to avoid the inventory glut that has plagued many other retailers over the last year.Quirky Companies: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A / BRK.B)Warren Buffet Stocks: a picture of warren buffett smiling.Source: Kent Sievers / Shutterstock.comI’m focusing on Warren Buffett’s entire company, not just its stock portfolio. And as a company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A / BRK.B) is pretty quirky. For starters, it’s based in Omaha, Nebraska, far from any financial hub. The company’s website is about as basic as a website can get, and it has no human resources department or marketing team. The firm’s  headquarters where Warren Buffett works employs fewer than 50 people, and, by most accounts, he has employed the same, small team for more than 30 years.Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway’s two senior leaders, Buffett and Charlie Munger, are both in their 90s now and still running the firm’s day-to-day operations. And Berkshire’s holdings include an eclectic mix of companies ranging from the Acme Brick Company and Benjamin Moore, a paint supplier, to the Dairy Queen fast food chain and Fruit of the Loom underwear. Both Buffett and Munger frequently discuss publicly their contempt for Wall Street, with Munger likening bankers to “heroin addicts.”Yet the company inspires a cult-like devotion among its shareholders, some 40,000 of whom descend on Omaha for Berkshire’s annual meeting, nicknamed “Woodstock for capitalists.”If you took Warren Buffett out of the picture and looked at Berkshire Hathaway on its own, it would seem like a very odd company. Yet the stock has been a juggernaut, delivering a 225% return over the past decade.However, the stock is also quirky. Specifically, Buffett refuses to pay dividends to Berkshire’s shareholders, and the Class A stock has never split, resulting in it currently trading at more than $450,000 for a single share.Stock indexes regularly have to make technical adjustments just to continue trading BRK.A stock. That’s weird.Crocs (CROX)The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.Source: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.comAmerican footwear company Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) has taken its novelty foam clogs mainstream. Before the pandemic, Crocs were largely sold in surf shops and along boardwalks at the beach. However, thanks to a clever and persistent, viral marketing strategy undertaken during the pandemic, Crocs can now be found in shoe stores across North America, and they are a hot item online.Key to Crocs’ success is that the firm invests 8% of its revenue in marketing, spending more than $200 million annually on internet influencers, brand partnerships, and digital ad campaigns. Celebrities who have endorsed Crocs in recent years include actress Drew Barrymore and the rock band KISS.In one of its quirkier promotions, Crocs ran an online-branding campaign comprised entirely of emojis. It has also promoted its foam clogs using online memes rather than traditional advertisements.The results have been impressive, with the company’s sales up 200% since 2019. In the last five years, CROX stock has gained 615%.Many people discovered the casual shoes while working and learning from home during the pandemic. But unlike other companies that thrived during the pandemic only to crash in the past year, Crocs’ sales gains have stuck. In February of this year, the company forecast another record year of growth in 2023.World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)wwe stock WWE Monday Night Raw at 02 Arena. LondonSource: Tom Rose / Shutterstock.comWrestling isn’t everybody’s cup of tea. But it sure is a successful business. World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE:WWE) has succeeded as both a company and a stock by fully embracing all the quirks of professional wrestling — from the spandex pants and body slams to broken tables and smack talk.Few, if any, entertainment stocks have outperformed WWE. In the last five years, the company’s share price has grown nearly 150%, including a 30% gain so far in 2023. The success comes despite a lot of drama behind the scenes that includes sexual misconduct allegations, executive departures, disputes with top performers, and a rumored sale of the company that has yet to materialize.Ironically, none of the behind-the-scenes drama has hurt WWE stock. If anything, it seems to have bolstered the share price.Most recently, Vince McMahon, who grew the company into the juggernaut it is today, returned to lead World Wrestling Entertainment after taking time away following allegations of sexual misdeeds. McMahon’s return led to his own daughter, Stephanie, resigning as co-CEO and chairwoman. It’s her second time leaving WWE. Now McMahon says he is preparing to sell World Wrestling, with possible suitors including Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). How it all plays out remains to be seen. But it’s sure to be dramatic.Quirky Companies: Science Applications International (SAIC)Science Applications International (NYSE:SAIC) is often referred to as the “Pentagon’s IT help desk.” In actual fact, Science Applications provides information technology support to the U.S. federal government in Washington, D.C. A niche business, Science Application International is not very well-known outside of the DC area. Yet, owing to SAIC’s lucrative government contracts, it is an extremely successful company whose stock has been an exceptional performer. Since its IPO a decade ago, SAIC stock has increased 255%.Due to the sensitive nature of its work with the government and the data that it has access to, Science Applications purposely keeps a low profile. Over the years, it has spun off and split its business several times to ensure that it can continue bidding on government contracts without running afoul of federal conflict-of-interest regulations.It has also invested nearly $800 million to expand its presence in the intelligence industry through classified contracts, obtaining security clearances, and building internal security infrastructure. This may sound too cloak-and-dagger for some. But Science Applications has grown into a company with a $6 billion market cap.Black Rifle Coffee (BRCC)Photo of exterior of a Black Rifle Coffee locationSource: Black Rifle Coffee CompanyLastly, we come to Black Rifle Coffee (NYSE:BRCC), or BRC as it is commonly known. This is not your typical coffee company. It was founded by a former Green Beret soldier and is operated by ex-members of the U.S. military. It also has a unique business model compared to more conventional coffee chains such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin’ Donuts. Rather than focus on a traditional retail network of coffee shops, Black Rifle Coffee primarily mails its coffee to consumers through a monthly subscription service.And, despite its military connection, Black Rifle Coffee is known for its humor. The company publishes an online magazine called “Coffee or Die” that focuses on military and law enforcement issues, with a big helping of humor.Its jokes also frequently trend on Twitter and other social media platforms. And the company makes regular, charitable donations to veteran organizations. These quirks have led Black Rifle Coffee to attract more than 100,000 subscribers who pay a monthly fee to have its coffee shipped to them.Black Rifle Coffee had the misfortune to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in February 2022 as the market was tanking. As a result, BRCC stock has declined 48% since it went public. However, the company’s future looks bright as it estimates its total addressable market at $4 billion annually. Black Rifle Coffee is also building a retail coffee shop network beyond its home base in Utah.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in CSU, AAPL and DIS.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams Sherwin-Williams' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Sherwin-Williams managed to grow EPS by 12% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Sherwin-Williams remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 11% to US$22b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Sherwin-Williams.Story continuesAre Sherwin-Williams Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$56b company like Sherwin-Williams. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$173m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Sherwin-Williams but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Sherwin-Williams To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Sherwin-Williams is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Sherwin-Williams (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

The expansion project is a critical component for future water supplies for the Monterey Peninsula, along with desalination and an Aquifer Storage and Recovery system that stores excess winter river flows for use during dry months. The announcement comes in response to the Order issued yesterday by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regarding California-American Water Company’s Application for Rehearing of Decision 22-12-001. The order denies a rehearing but modifies several critical portions of the decision.""Since 1995, residents of the Monterey Peninsula have faced an uncertain future for their water supply,"" said Kevin Tilden, president of California American Water. ""Today, with desalination and water reuse in process, and aquifer storage and recovery on line, the Peninsula now has a secure water future. This will protect the Carmel River while providing water needed for the community. I want to thank everyone who worked hard on each of these projects to bring them to fruition.""In its original PWMe decision, issued in December 2022, the Commission delayed recovery of infrastructure investments made by the company to support the project, denied recovery of the company’s actual financing costs, and contradicted CPUC precedent and practice. The decision as originally written would have had substantial negative impacts on the company, its customers and the region. California American Water requested the CPUC review the decision.In yesterday’s order, the CPUC has corrected factual errors to its original decision. California American Water will be allowed standard ratemaking treatment for the construction funding of the pumps and pipes that were built to support the expansion. The company is also required to file additional information about proposed extraction wells that parties agree are needed to deliver PWMe water from the Seaside Aquifer to customers across the service area.Story continuesTogether, the recently approved desalination plant and the Pure Water Monterey Expansion will allow the community to replace water no longer available from the Carmel River and comply with the orders of the State Water Resources Control Board.About California American Water:California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 700,000 people.

""We also remain steadfastly committed to addressing the needs of our most vulnerable customers and have included components in our request to keep their rates affordable.""In today’s filing, Indiana American Water is seeking to increase revenues over a phased, three step process through May 2025 that would result in $86.7 million of additional annual revenue when fully implemented. If the company’s proposed rates are approved as requested, the bill for a typical residential customer using 4,000 gallons per month would increase approximately $14 per month when rates are fully implemented in 2025. The company last filed for new rates through a general rate filing in September 2018 and last implemented new rates in 2019.The increases for residential wastewater customers will vary depending on the community served. Additional information on current rates is available on the company’s website at https://www.amwater.com/inaw/customer-service-billing/your-water-rates.Results of a customer affordability study conducted as part of the filing demonstrate that the affordability of the company’s water and wastewater services as a comparison of monthly bills to monthly household income has steadily improved over the past decade and will remain affordable under the company’s proposed rates.Story continuesRecognizing that affordability may still be an issue for some customers, the company is proposing a new rate design that provides 1,500 gallons of water usage at no additional cost above the fixed monthly customer charge for all water customers. The proposed change would provide relatively low-cost basic water service for customers on fixed incomes that use a lower volume of water than the typical residential customer.The filing also includes a proposed Universal Affordability Tariff to provide multiple tiers of discounts to address the affordability needs of different levels of household income. Under the new rate structure, eligible households would receive monthly bill discounts of between 30 and 80 percent for water service.The IURC’s rate review process offers multiple opportunities for customer involvement. Customers can participate through written comments, attendance at public input hearings, and consumer advocacy organizations that participate in the proceedings.

Chapter two, can we please do that?[MUSIC PLAYING]- Bro, you're actually funny.- I knew that. A lot of people know that. I'm-- OK, what's getting me is the actually.- Go ahead.- Let's light this can.SEANA SMITH: Those are some TikToks there from energy drink company, Celsius Holdings, which recently crossed 2 million followers on the TikTok app. And their popularity there is one of the reasons why we have seen that stock soar, outperforming here up nearly 70% in just the past year. But after lawmakers grilled TikToks CEO on Capitol Hill last week, there's lots of talk about a potential ban. And a new Pew Research poll showing that half of americans would actually support a ban of the apps.So let's talk about the potential business impact of that possible ban. For that, we want to bring in John Fieldly, Celsius Holdings CEO. And John, it's great to speak with you here, lots of talk about-- the ban on TikTok, the business implications there. You obviously have a massive presence on TikTok. So what would that mean for your business?JOHN FIELDLY: Yeah. I mean, TikTok has been a great platform for us to really connect with consumers and a specific audience in a really relatable way. And as you mentioned, we just achieved 2 million followers, which is a great accomplishment. Actually, I've only been on the platform for about a year, a little over a year now.So you know, it's a great marketing vehicle for us. Social media continues to evolve and adapt. And on TikTok specifically, a lot of great creators as well. So there's a lot of people making a living on that platform, and you know, which is key to them. In regards to our marketing and initiatives and the way we connect with consumers, we see a lot of opportunities, you know, further expanding on TikTok, also YouTube, with YouTube Shorts being added, also on Snapchat taking opportunity, getting into the short video.Story continuesSo you know, it's there's a variety of different platforms. We kind of stay ahead of the trends and where the consumers and the communities are moving to and where they're going. So the key would marketing brands is being agile. So you know, with Celsius here, we're very agile. And it'll be, you know, it would be disappointing if it is taken down. But we'll be agile and move on. But it is a key component. And getting 2 million followers with a core community is really-- is, you know, something we're really proud of.SEANA SMITH: John, you mentioned the fact, YouTube Shorts and Snap to other social media platforms, where you are seeing a lot of traction. Is that where you are going to go and focus on if TikTok is banned?JOHN FIELDLY: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, consumers are spending more time on their phones within these social platforms than ever before. I think some of the latest data that just came out, it's over almost two hours a day, two to three hours a day, I believe the latest data, is consumers are spending on these social media platforms, which is substantial, longer times engaging in social platforms than on TV these days.So it is a definitely way brands are connecting with consumers. You've got to be on the social media. I always say, on the phone is really critical. So we are engaging on YouTube. YouTube Shorts, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram has been key to get the brand out, and really connect with more consumers, and connect with their communities. And brands are all about community building. And that's where these platforms allow you to really get close to your consumer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, John, national security risk, obviously, some social impacts of-- from TikTok was kind of the one side that was portrayed while TikTok CEO was on Capitol Hill last week. Is that consistent with what you see? Or what is your view of TikTok?JOHN FIELDLY: Yeah. I know there's a there's a lot of questions about it and controversy. You know, we see it as a really a great way to connect with consumers on a creative way. A lot of creativity, a lot of creative users, and a lot of great fun dancing out there with some short videos. So we have a lot of fun with it. We see it as a great way to engage with consumers. On our platform, we have 2 million followers. We do a lot of great content around the office as well and show people behind the scenes.So we have a great-- a lot of fun with it, a lot of exciting times. And you know, we'll move and be agile, which is key. But as it is today, we're having fun with it every day.SEANA SMITH: Certainly, it's very easy to get lost in that feed. John, I mentioned your stock performance in the intro there. It has been really performing extremely well over the past year up just about 70%. You've seen some of those gains slip a little bit since the start of the year. What is it that you think is really driving that momentum? And what is it going to keep investors excited about Celsius?JOHN FIELDLY: We're really excited now, we just put up a record year in 2022, really drove great revenues. We also just partnered with PepsiCo last year, which really started off our distribution partnership in October of last year. We're now the number three energy drink in the category. And we're in about 90% of all stores around the US and growing exponentially.So really, gaining more consumers each day, we have a great product, great innovative products. I'm drinking a brand new lemon lime flavor we just launched, one of the most refreshing energy drinks on the market that we're told. So taste great. We're ahead of the trends. We have over seven essential vitamins with green tea, ginger, and guarana. We taste great. We offer a function, clinically proven functionality. And we're fitness forward position. And all about living fit and living healthy and bring it living life to its fullest. So Celsius live fit, essential energy for life. And exciting, it's exciting time for the company, and all of our employees, and our fans, and our followers as well.SEANA SMITH: And John, I wish I had a Celsius here on set. It will really help me get through on this Friday afternoon. You mentioned that partnership here with Pepsi. Any thought just in terms of would you ever be open to a potential acquisition, given the fact that your industry is so competitive, and you're up against a lot of those larger players?JOHN FIELDLY: It is really tough. I mean, we're up against two of the largest brands in all of CPG. And there are truly two monsters ahead of us to say. But it's exciting right now, you know, with a brand is. We're publicly traded, so I guess we're for sale every day of the week. But at this point, you know, we're working hard. We have a great team behind us.We have over 350 employees growing every day. We have new retailers coming on board. And you know, it's just a really exciting prime. The brand, that flavors taste great. It's exciting. I'm just glad to be here with the team. And our team is working hard. So we're excited for the future.SEANA SMITH: All right. Celsius shares, like I said, up just about 70% in the last year. John Fieldly, CEO of Celsius, thanks so much.JOHN FIELDLY: Thank you.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 81% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would appreciate the 6.5% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 26%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Union Pacific, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Union Pacific does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Union Pacific's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Union Pacific. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.9%. With 6.9% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Union PacificThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Union Pacific Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$231m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Union Pacific. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Union Pacific better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Union Pacific that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

307,60f55d49-553c-343f-9563-80b05bfa3d85,AMP,2023-04-01,4 GARP Stocks to Scoop Up for Maximum Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-garp-stocks-scoop-maximum-133601906.html,1680269761,STORY,"['GWW', 'AMP', 'A']","[Growth at a reasonable price, or GARP, is an excellent strategy to earn quick investment profits. The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.Therefore, a portfolio based on the GARP strategy contains stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. W.W. Grainger GWW, Ameriprise Financial AMP, Agilent Technologies A and Bloomin’ Brands BLMN are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects regarding cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Story continuesScreening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS &amp; projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared with the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four of the six stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.
