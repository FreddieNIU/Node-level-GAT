1,4ec93372-0a86-304b-91bc-398a0bc2345c,SCHW,2022-11-11,"With 69% institutional ownership, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/69-institutional-ownership-charles-schwab-120039009.html,1668168039,STORY,['SCHW'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 69% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Charles Schwab. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Charles Schwab?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Charles Schwab already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Charles Schwab's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Charles Schwab. Our data shows that The Toronto-Dominion Bank is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 6.2% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Charles Schwab are the second and third largest shareholders. Charles Schwab, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Co-Chairman of the Board.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Charles SchwabWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$9.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 12% of Charles Schwab. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

It has amassed assets over $14.75 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap BlendWith more potential comes more risk, and small cap companies, with market capitalization below $2 billion, epitomizes this way of thinking.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.39%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 18.70% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Lpl Financial Holdings Inc (LPLA) accounts for about 0.49% of total assets, followed by Zoominfo Technologies Inc (ZI) and Eqt Corp (EQT).The top 10 holdings account for about 3.49% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHA seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index includes the small-cap portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index actually available to investors in the marketplace.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -16.88% so far this year and is down about -20.07% in the last one year (as of 11/11/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $37.65 and $54.57.The ETF has a beta of 1.16 and standard deviation of 30.95% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1797 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. SmallCap ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHA is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares Core S&amp;P SmallCap ETF (IJR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 ETF has $53.77 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P SmallCap ETF has $68.20 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon.A stock split is when a company increases its number of outstanding shares in an effort to boost its stock's liquidity and make it more affordable for investors. The underlying value of the business does not change, since the price of each share decreases in proportion to the increase in the number of outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 100,000 shares outstanding at a price of $10 per share, its market cap would be $1 million. If the company decides to go for a 2-for-1 stock split, the company will then have 200,000 shares outstanding at a price of $5 per share, and the market cap will stay the same at $1 million. Stock splits are usually carried out on a regular basis, such as every quarter or every year. They are often seen as a sign of a company's health and growth potential. Stock splits can also be beneficial for companies as they can repurchase their shares at a lower price. Typically, stock splits are indicative of a company's health and growth and are also indicative of management's confidence in their business.Mega Caps That Split In 2022Stock splits have been all the rage in 2022, with mega caps like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the way. On February 1, Alphabet Inc.

Fortunately for existing homeowners, most of whom own their houses outright or have locked in low, fixed mortgage rates, rising rates have not directly impacted their finances unless they have an outstanding variable-rate home equity line of credit.Homebuilders, who rely on incremental demand for housing, have seen demand dry up in response to declining affordability. Single-family home building permits have plummeted in recent months back to pre-pandemic levels.That’s the bad news. On the bright side, the building materials supply chain, which delayed construction and increased the cost to build a home, is rapidly improving. This bodes well for homebuilders like NVR with a track record of cost discipline. In other words, even if NVR’s average selling price declines, it can maintain attractive gross margins if they simultaneously control costs…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. As per Bank of America, a new bull market could emerge in 2023 after the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates in 2022 in a bid to control inflation. While most investors are focused on the Fed's continuous rate hikes, they fail to observe that the central bank is shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet by means of monthly roll-offs of its treasury and mortgage debt worth $95 billion. Paired with rising rates, this move will make the global market illiquid, which can trigger a reversal in the Fed’s policy making next year. BofA's investment strategist Michael Hartnett said that central banks are ""petrified of market consequences of liquidity withdrawal.” The US dollar climbing new highs is another signal that the Fed could potentially press pause on its fiscal tightening. Any shift from the Fed, whether it chooses to halt future interest rate hikes or continues its monthly balance sheet reductions, could be a positive indicator for investors and result in a significant rally. However, Hartnett observed that the market will experience more pain before a relief rally in 2023, and he expects that stocks will touch record lows soon. As stocks hurtle towards new lows, investors are taking this opportunity to pile into high-quality firms which would normally be trading at much higher multiples. Case in point, Hartnett observed on October 21 that equities experienced in flows of more than $9 billion in the past week. Some of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023 include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services for individual customers, small and mid-sized businesses, institutional investors, large enterprises, and governments worldwide. It is one of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s dividend yield on November 11 came in at 2.31%. JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) to $39 from $35.50 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to pick up for next year. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:10 Stocks That Will Make You RichGoldman Sachs Semiconductor StocksBest Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 13 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

20,cf424446-13d8-302a-8da9-0a1b0f8c7d73,UAA,2022-11-11,23 Penny Stocks to Buy for a MASSIVE Bull Market in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/23-penny-stocks-buy-massive-173636273.html,1667842596,STORY,"['BBBY', 'UAA', 'WW', 'SABR', 'SWIM', 'SOFI', 'MG', 'HTZ']","[Last week, tech stocks closed 20% above their recent lows, an astonishingly accurate indicator of new bull markets. With the exception of the 2001 crash, every 20% recovery since 1980 has been met with double-digit returns the following year. A similar boost today would add $9.2 trillion to the stock marketAs a percentage, these profits are often magnified among penny stocks. In 2020, car rental firm Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) jumped 1,100% after recovering car prices and a takeover bid from Knighthead Capital Management sent shares soaring.“Hertz could become the top penny stock of 2021,” I wrote a month before the deal. “Bankruptcy proceedings usually leave equity investors with nothing… [but] Hertz might join American Airlines as an exception.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPenny stocks can also do well without a potential bankruptcy on their books. Shares of Bowflex maker Nautilus (NYSE:NLS) rose 1,900% the same year.The Power of Penny StocksThese stunning returns are made possible by ultra-low valuations. At 56 cents, Hertz’s over-the-counter shares valued the car rental firm at less than $100 million — a 99.6% drop from its peak reached in 2014. And at its nadir, Nautilus traded at less than 0.075x price-to-sales (P/S) at its $1.20 price.Penny stocks are also particularly sensitive to the economic climate. In 2020, shares of companies trading for less than $5 dropped an average of 37%, underperforming companies over $100 by 700 basis points.That’s why penny stocks are so rewarding in recovering markets. Rising investor confidence, improving financial liquidity and higher risk appetites tend to impact shares of higher-risk stocks more than they do with lower-risk ones. As Federal Reserve policy begins to loosen in 2023 as markets expect, many penny stocks will rebound.A Word of Warning on Penny StocksThe massive upside, however, also comes with equally large risks. Many stocks under $1 trade on the OTC (over-the-counter) markets, where reporting standards are more relaxed. Pink sheet companies are not required to provide audited financial reports, and many “shell” companies exist only as financial tools for their owners.Story continuesSmall market capitalizations can also make these penny stocks a target for market manipulation. In 2020, the former CEO of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) settled with the SEC for “lucrative market manipulation,” after running a “classic pump-and-dump scheme” on his company’s shares. And even well-meaning management teams can have their stocks hijacked by market promoters or social media influencers if the company’s float is small enough.Finally, low trading volume can limit the size of any given investment, even for ordinary investors. Buying up $1,000 of a $1 stock would take two business weeks (10 days) or more if sellers are only parting with 100 shares each day.Nevertheless, studies have long shown that penny stocks provide abnormal returns beyond what traditional models predict. And for investors looking to ride a wave of investor optimism, penny stocks are one of the best places to put fundamental and quantitative research to work.A Quantitative Approach to Penny Stock InvestingI’ve written at length on fundamental approaches to penny stock investing. By taking fewer shots on goal, investors can maximize their returns if any single winner emerges.The strategy does come with significant risks. My No. 1 penny stock pick for 2022, for instance, is down 62% for the year, while my No. 2 pick gained 103%. Investors with insufficient diversification could have lost money this year.To counter that, my list of 23 penny stocks to buy includes a wide range of companies chosen by my Profit &amp; Protection system. It’s a proven method that has analyzed years of past data to find what works in the markets, and grades companies based on their ability to generate returns over the following 12 months.The system often picks unintuitive candidates. In May, the system named the struggling Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) as a “growth” stock for its turnaround potential. BBBY shares would rise 150% soon after. And even near-bankrupt firms like Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) can earn A+ scores for their potential as a short-squeeze candidate. When a stock borders on zero, the only way it can often go is up.As markets prepare for a 2023 rebound, here are 23 top penny stocks to buy.23 Penny Stocks to Buy Before the Market RecoversVelodyne Lidar (VLDR)Image of the Velodyne Lidar (VLDR) sign outside the company's headquarters.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: B| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: ATopping my quantitative Profit &amp; Protection list of penny stocks is Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR), a promising San Jose-based autonomous vehicle firm. Shares now trade for under $1 after a brutal selloff in the first half 2022, pricing the company at 1x forward book value.Analysts are now projecting a stunning 62% growth rate in 2023 and 94% in 2024, pushing Velodyne’s growth score into the A+ range and its average score to an A.There are some issues, of course, with the company at the fundamental level. Firstly, the company lags behind rival Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) in R&amp;D. Penny stock investors are banking on a No. 2 player. Secondly, my quantitative “quality” score overstates Velodyne’s intrinsic quality; rapid operating earnings growth will still leave the company in the red until at least 2025. And finally, its upcoming merger with rival Ouster (NYSE:OUST) creates near-term M&amp;A risk for investors.Nevertheless, Velodyne is a promising bet on the future of autonomous driving. If its high quantitative scores are any indication, it’s picks like these that tend to outperform over the next 12 months.Skillz (SKLZ)Skillz (SKLZ) company logo on a websiteSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A| Value: A| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: ASkillz (NYSE:SKLZ), the mobile e-sports platform, saw revenues drop 18% in Q2 2022. Shares are down 86% year to date to $1.“Positioning the company for profitability had a real cost,” admitted co-founder and CEO Andrew Paradise in the company’s Q2 call. “Revenue after engagement marketing, paying monthly active users, all fell sequentially quarter-over-quarter.”But the company’s renewed focus on profitability has helped the firm in other ways. The company reduced its net loss by almost $90 million that quarter, and closed loopholes of user cheating. Wall Street analysts now expect that revenues at the San Francisco-based firm will stabilize at $262 million in 2023 and rise above $300 million the following year.These factors have helped push Skillz’s Profit &amp; Protection scores solidly into the A range. Seven of the 11 analysts covering Skillz now have target prices that imply potential gains of 40% or higher. Though Skillz’ share price has turned the promising gaming firm into a penny stock, quantitative research has shown that such firms can come roaring back.RealReal (REAL)The RealReal website on a smartphone representing REAL stock.Source: Ascannio/Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A+| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+The discount e-commerce firm RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) has one of the highest Profit &amp; Protection scores possible. And not without good reason.“The luxury apparel resale space has been chronically underserved,” notes Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop. “The RealReal’s business model exists to serve this end market more efficiently… We view the firm’s strategy as sound and believe that ongoing investments in fulfillment efficiency, brick-and-mortar stores, and diversified supply sourcing represent a solid roadmap toward profitability and (potentially) excess returns.”Analysts have good reasons to remain bullish. RealReal follows in the footsteps of other successful discounters (Gilt Groupe, RueLaLa) and adds additional barriers to entry with a network of thousands of consignor buyers. Rapidly improving returns help drive the e-commerce’s “quality” score to an A+.RealReal also earns an A+ for growth. Analysts are expecting a 34% revenue growth rate in 2022, followed by 21% in 2023 and 26% in 2024, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.As the U.S. economy recovers from its recessionary slump, revenues and earnings at the Real Real should increase. Wall Street expects revenues to rise 20% in 2023 to $755, and for the firm to break even on an EBITDA basis the year after. And at under $1.50, the true bargain might be RealReal’s shares.AppHarvest (APPH)Rows of plants being farmed indoorsSource: Silga Bauge-Robezniece / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+AppHarvest (NASDAQ:APPH) is one of the fastest-growing food production firms in America. The company expects to have 165 acres of high-value greenhouse space by the end of 2022, which should generate almost $100 million in revenue next year. AppHarvest could earn as much as a 25% gross margin on goods, according to Wall Street analysts, earning the company a solid B+ quality score.The Appalachian-based firm is a leader in large greenhouse operations. Its 60-acre Morehead CEA greenhouse is one of the world’s largest and uses around 90% less water than traditional open-field production.Shares of the firm, however, have been battered by controversy. Activists have filed lawsuits, alleging misleading press releases and presentations; the involvement of polarizing politician J. D. Vance has further increased scrutiny of the firm.Still, these low prices award AppHarvest an A grade for value. The company now trades for book value, reducing the potential downside for investors. And an improved harvest in 2023 could surprise markets to the upside. Though AppHarvest remains a highly speculative penny stock, the Profit &amp; Protection system has flagged shares as a potential growth and turnaround firm.Aeva Technologies Inc (AEVA)Autonomous self driving electric car using lidar change the lane and overtakes city vehicleSource: temp-64GTX / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: ARumors have long swirled that the Aeva (NYSE:AEVA), a laser-sensor startup, could eventually help Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) create its first Apple car. The small firm was founded by two ex-Apple engineers, one of which helped develop the Apple Watch.Aeva has already received strategic investments from Porsche (OTCMKTS:POAHY) and management believes they could generate revenue from series production by 2024. Wall Street analysts agree, giving Aeva a $215 million revenue target for that year. Its growth score stands at an excellent A+.The Mountain View, California-based firm has plenty of hurdles. Its sagging share price and a $235 million cash burn in the past year give it limited scope to fundraise. And its $380 million cash pile could run out by mid-2024 if the firm misses revenue projections. The firm only earns a B+ in quality for these reasons and more.Still, penny stock investors have good reason to expect Aeva to succeed, or at least get acquired by a larger firm. Aeva focuses on the software end of lidar, an often overlooked area of laser sensors. And its $400 market capitalization makes it possible for would-be acquirers to swallow.Workhorse Group (WKHS)A Workhorse (WKHS) W-15 hybrid electric pickup truck on display at a branding event in Flatiron Plaza in New York.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B+| Momentum: A| Total: AIn August, California green-lighted legislation that would ban all new gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035. Many states like Massachusetts have trigger laws that will follow the Golden State’s lead.That’s creating a windfall for electric vehicle makers, including electric truck maker Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS).Since ejecting its former CEO Steve Burns in 2021, Workhorse’s management has focused on turning the company around.“We are gaining commercial momentum,” CEO Richard Dauch said in the company’s Q2 2022 earnings call. “Make no mistake, Workhorse is a fundamentally different company today than it was a year ago.” The company now has a full medium-duty EV portfolio and has secured a significant purchase order for commercial vehicles.Analysts now expect Workhorse to generate $127 million in revenue for 2023 and $325 million for 2024, up from only $18 million in 2022. These factors award Workhorse an A+ in growth and an A grade overall.The company’s beaten-down shares could be next to rise. WHKS trades at under $2.70 despite having zero debt.FuelCell Energy (FCEL)An image of the FuelCell (FCEL Stock) logo.Source: Bern James / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+In many ways, FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) was the poster child of 2021 speculation. Company shares rose from $2 to $26 in a frenzy over green technologies. For a brief moment in time, hydrogen seemed to be the next frontier in new-age energy.Shares would eventually fall back to $3 after the company failed to meet Wall Street’s lofty expectations……But look under the hood, and the firm is still growing.The company is on track to generate $134 million in revenue this year, up 93% from the year before. And at current rates, the firm could break even in 2025. The firm earns an A+ for growth from my quantitative Profit &amp; Protection system.Energy shortages in Europe have also reignited interest in green hydrogen. Multiple deals are now in the works to supply northern Europe with millions of tons of hydrogen derived from renewable energy. Rising profitability gives FCEL an A+ for quality.That puts FuelCell in a strong position. Analysts now expect the firm to grow an average of 28% through 2024. And if the company reaches these targets, investors should expect its shares to recover in short order.8×8 (EGHT)hands holding smartphone with social media icons floating above it. brick wall background.Source: ShutterstockGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+8×8 (NYSE:EGHT) is an unusual penny stock for its profitability. The provider of voice, team chat and other online communication tools has seen EBIT grow from a $60.88 million loss in 2020 to an expected $32 million this year, earning itself an A+ for quality. Wall Street analysts are expecting another 59% boost in operating profits next year as more firms adopt permanent remote work policies.The Campbell, California-based firm is also relatively established, with 2.5 million paid business customers using its services. (Though this lowers its growth score slightly to an A-). Its gross profit margin comes in at a healthy 67%.None of this has helped 8×8’s stock price. Shares have fallen from $35 into the $3.50 range, mirroring similar losses at rival cloud communication providers Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO).Nevertheless, 8×8 remains a high-potential bet on a profitable firm, according to its Profit &amp; Protection scores. Shares trade at mild 14x forward price-to-earnings (P/E), making this overall A+ penny stock one of the best values on Wall Street today.Latham Group (SWIM)Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming poolSource: ShutterstockGrowth: B+| Value: A+| Quality: B-| Momentum: A+| Total: A-Latham Group (NASDAQ:SWIM) is the largest designer, producer and marketer of in-ground residential swimming pools in North America. It’s also one of Wall Street’s cheapest deep-value stocks. At $4.50, SWIM trades at 6.2x P/E and under 5x price-to-cashflow, earning an A+ in value.These low valuations are a product of an unusually heavy debt load. The firm holds $263 million in long-term debt from a private equity deal in 2015, and interest payments have consumed at least 45% of operating income every year. No matter how much cash flow Latham Group produces, much of it goes back into creditor hands. Its quality is firmly in the B- range.That could change in 2023 and beyond as the firm continues to grow and pay down debt. In his Q2 earnings call, CFO Robert Masson gave updated guidance of 19% to 22% topline year-over-year growth. Price momentum is also working in Latham’s favor, according to the Profit &amp; Protection system. Though it won’t be a smooth ride up, Latham remains one of the system’s top penny stock picks to watch as a turnaround play.WW International (WW)Indianapolis - Circa August 2020: WW International studio, formally Weight Watchers location.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: A| Momentum: A+| Total: AShares of the New York-based wellness company WW International (NASDAQ:WW) have admittedly yo-yoed like a diet gone bad. Shares ballooned from $4 to over $100 between 2015 and 2018 after TV personality Oprah Winfrey bought a significant stake……only to drop back to $4.50 again four years later.Today, the company formerly known as Weight Watchers has become a top penny stock for its cheap share price, high quality and turnaround-like momentum.First, WW International scores an A+ in value for its absurdly low 3.2x price-to-cashflow ratio. It’s one of the cheapest companies on the stock market by that metric.Next, there’s quality, where WW scores an A. The firm has managed to remain profitable every year since 1997, an achievement that few penny stocks can claim.Finally, there’s momentum. WW shares have fallen 53% in the past six months and are down 73% year to date. The Profit &amp; Protection system has shown that such negative price momentum is often followed by a large bounce.Though WW International has allowed its overheads to bloat over the years, shares remain attractive at $4.50, especially if cost-cutting measures (belt-tightening, anyone?) begin to work.Consolidated Communications (CNSL)Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. (CNCL) logo displayed on smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A| Value: A+| Quality: B-| Momentum: C| Total: B+Consolidated Communications Holding (NASDAQ:CNSL), the broadband provider, has struggled with a high debt load. The company generated $118 million operating income in FY2021, only to post a $100 million net loss after counting interest and other non-operating charges. Company shares trade at 0.5x price-to-sales, around a less than a fifth of rival Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR).Ordinarily, most investors would pass over CNSL as a has-been player in a slow-growth market. But the quantitative Profit &amp; Protection stock-picking system is predicting a turnaround. Analysts expect that cost-cutting will help the company stem losses to $24 million this year — a marked improvement from 2021. And the firm’s $1.025 billion of net assets provides some downside; the firm could theoretically sell its assets to a larger competitor if cash gets tight.Though the company’s momentum is pointing to a tough year ahead, patient investors will find it worthwhile to keep CNSL on their radar for when prices begin to tick back up. The firm’s A+ value is too cheap to pass up.Virgin Galactic (SPCE)Virgin Galactic (SPCE) banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange building to celebrate its IPO.Source: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B- | Momentum: A+| Total: A-Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is an unusual firm to find in the penny stock bargain bin. The company went public in one of the first blockbuster SPAC deals on Wall Street, raising $674 million in the process. Shares of the space tourism company would go on to trade as high as $55 in the frothy 2021 market.Today, Virgin Galactic’s $5 price tag has made it attractive to the quantitative Profit &amp; Protection system. Analysts still believe the company could generate as much as $350 million in revenue by 2026, according to surveys by Thomson Reuters, giving the firm an A+ growth grade. And SPCE’s negative momentum indicates a firm that could rebound over a value-driven turnaround. Though SPCE remains risky for its low quality, my Profit &amp; Protection system is beginning to label the space travel firm as a potential turnaround to ride.Harsco (HSC)Bins are filled with various recyclibles, including cardboard, glass, and plasticSource: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: B| Momentum: A+| Total: A-If you’ve ever wanted to know what a Warren Buffett “cigar-butt” company looks like, Harsco (NYSE:HSC) is about as close as you can get. The waste management firm helps industrial companies recycle metal, manage scrap and process waste before it goes into landfills. Not exactly a high-growth industry at first glance.The company’s declining quality has also weighed down its quantitative scores. Pre-tax profits have fallen from a $113 million peak in 2018 to $37.5 million in 2021 on higher overhead costs and declining margins. The company only scores a moderate B in qualityBut the same forces have also pushed Harsco’s shares into deep value territory. At under $6, HSC shares now value the company at around 0.5x price-to-book and earns a solid A+ grade for value. And growth isn’t a lost cause either. Wall Street analysts are projecting a return to operating income growth by 2023 as industrial output picks back up. Harsco earns an A- for growth.Together these factors suggest that investors should still consider this beaten-down penny stock as the market rebounds.Mistras Group (MG)Pipelines in the desertSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: B+| Momentum: C| Total: A-The New Jersey-based Mistras Group (NYSE:MG) scores relatively well on the Profit &amp; Protection system, earning an A- overall for its high value and quality.The energy service company operates an asset protection system, which helps energy, manufacturing and power firms inspect pipelines and other essential assets. It’s a cyclical business that saw declines in 2016 and 2020. Its quality lags at a B+ grade for that reason.A boom in U.S. energy, however, is quickly pushing the industry back into a boom. Wall Street analysts now expect Mistras to generate $800 million in revenue by 2024, a significant increase from the $677 million generated in 2021. Earnings could double to $14.4 million next year, earning Mistras Group an A-for growth. The firm also trades at an excellent 12.8x P/E ratio, earning an A+ for value.These figures have helped award Mistras Group an overall score of A-. If energy prices rebound as many analysts expect, Mistras Group could see its momentum score follow upwards in short order.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)the Social Finance (SoFi stock) logo is displayed on a smartphone.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: B+| Quality: A+| Momentum: A| Total: AInvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango has long pounded the table on SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI), a highly promising fintech.“SoFi stock has been absolutely crushed over the past year… But as the old saying goes, it’s always darkest before the dawn. By 2030, it’ll rise around 25X from current levels.”Now, the Profit &amp; Protection system has also flagged SOFI as a top pick. Net interest income is expected to double in 2022 to $515 million, and increase to $842 million by 2024 as rates continue to rise. And analysts are now projecting positive operating income by 2024. These factors help award SoFi a solid A+ for growth.SoFi also has some surprising quality behind the numbers. The company has aggressively grown to become an “Amazon of finance” by cutting deals with existing providers of everything from financial planning to insurance products. The firm could legitimately become worth multiples of its current $5.20 penny stock price.There are some concerns, of course. The company scores an average B+ in its value score for a relatively rich price. And the quantitative Profit &amp; Protection system misses much of SoFi’s bank risk, since such figures don’t show up in financials until it’s far too late.Still, SoFi remains a top penny stock for its massive growth runway, strong turnaround momentum and the potential to bring online banking to the masses once and for all. Don’t expect SoFi to languish at $5 forever.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)bed bath &amp; beyond storefront (BBBY)Source: ShutterstockGrowth: A| Value: A+| Quality: B-| Momentum: A+| Total: A-In May, the Profit &amp; Protection system flagged home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond as a promising turnaround play. Shares had become so cheap that the only direction the meme stock could go was up.Shares would rise 150% within two months.Today, a new slump in BBBY shares provides a second chance for risk-seeking investors. Markets price the lossmaking firm at 0.2x sales, and the company’s negative momentum is setting up the stock for a short-term bounce. It’s a typical turnaround play that the Profit &amp; Protection system loves to flag.None of this means that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond will succeed in the long run. The company scores a B- in quality, and analysts expect the firm will keep generating losses through FY2025. But historically, near-bankrupt firms from Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) to JC Penney provided plenty of opportunities for speculation before they finally went under for good.Altice USA (ATUS)A blurred image of a television studioSource: chanonnat srisura / Shutterstock.comGrowth: C| Value: A+| Quality: A| Momentum: A+| Total: B+Altice USA’s (NYSE:ATUS) growth score of C should immediately warn investors. The NYC-based cable television provider is expected to see revenues decrease by 4% next year as more consumers cut cords. Net income could drop as much as 11% to $565 million, a 43% decline from 2021 levels.Yet, ATUS provides a compelling penny stock investment for its steady cash flows and low share price. Analysts expect the firm to generate almost $500 million in free cash flow next year, pricing the stock at an astonishing 5.7X price-to-free-cashflow (P/FCF). The firm earns an A+ for value.The company’s price momentum also shares elements of other turnaround plays. The stock has declined 55% over the past six months to $4.70, and stabilized in October. Such patterns are indicative of a near-term bounce.Altice is far from a growth company. But experienced investors in other deep-value penny stocks will immediately recognize the potential for making quick cash.Sabre Corp (SABR)The logo for Sabre Corporation (SABR) is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A+| Quality: A+| Momentum: B+| Total: A+Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) is one of the four major Global Distribution Systems, centralized databases of airline and hotel bookings. It’s an oligopolistic business that’s helped Sabre, Amadeus and Travelport generate years of profitable growth.The Covid-19 pandemic upended that notion. Sabre lost $1 billion in 2020 and another $677 million in 2021, sending its richly valued shares into penny stock territory. Today, shares change hands for less than $5.But the Profit &amp; Protection system is starting to see a turnaround for Sabre and its GDS peers. Wall Street analysts are now projecting a 55% increase in 2022 revenue and another 26% for next year. Operating earnings are expected to turn positive again in 2023, earning Sabre an A+ for both growth and quality.Signs are already emerging that air travel demand is back on the rise. In October, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) noted that “consumer appetite for travel is showing no signs of slowing down despite high airfares and concerns about the economy.” Shares would jump 7% on the news.As travelers take back to the skies, Sabre and other GDS firms stand to benefit. Don’t expect Sabre to remain a penny stock for long.Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI)The Sirius XM (SIRI) mobile app logo on a smartphone screen.Source: ShutterstockGrowth: B+| Value: B| Quality: A+| Momentum: B+| Total: B+The high-quality Sirius XM Holdings is a “safer” play for penny stock investors. The company earns a high A+ in quality for its abnormally large profit margins, but scores lower in growth, value and momentum.A closer look under the hood shows why. Revenues are expected to grow between 3%-4% through 2024, and net income ~5% despite its 2019 acquisition of Pandora. It’s a metronome, not a meteor, when it comes to growth thanks to management’s “slow-and-steady” approach.Similarly, Sirius XM isn’t particularly cheap. Shares trade at 20x P/E, well within striking distance of rival Apple. It’s priced as a tech company, not as a telecom.Still, the stock represents a relatively safe way for investors to buy into penny stocks. Sirius’ management has remained relatively disciplined in capital expenditure and has consistently bought back shares with free cash flow. SIRI won’t be the most exciting penny stock to buy, but it’s certainly a safer bet, according to its Profit &amp; Protection scores.Turtle Beach (HEAR)Image of a gamer with a headset facing a screenSource: Donna Lupgens / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A| Value: A+| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR), the California-based gaming headphone firm, is about as cyclical as they come. Shares peaked at over $80 in 2013 before dropping to $2 by 2017……Rose to $27 in 2018 and dropped to $5 in 2020……Rose to $33 in 2021 before…Well, you get the idea. Turtle Beach is a fashion company masquerading as a gaming firm. The company only earns a B+ for its gyrating quality.Yet, HEAR is offering another chance for investors to jump back in. Shares trade at $8, and the $100 million firm now earns an A+ for momentum after its recent stabilization.Analysts also remain bullish about this cyclical firm. Revenues are expected to recover to $325 million next year, a 19% year-over-year increase while operating income should hit $15 million. Turtle Beach consequently earns an A grade for growth.That makes Turtle Beach a solid turnaround play, according to its quantitative scores. Much like Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, this cyclical firm could still have more left to give.1-800-Flowers.Com (FLWS)1-800-flowers logo and storefrontSource: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: A-| Momentum: A+| Total: AShares of the e-commerce firm 1-800-Flowers.com (NASDAQ:FLWS) collapsed in 2022 over rising overhead costs and compressing margins. FY2022 operating earnings came in at $45 million, down from $152 million the year before. Its quality score has fallen to an A-Yet, declining stock prices have pushed the 46-year-old firm into the A+ value territory. Shares now trade at 0.21x price-to-sales (P/S), a 66% discount to its 0.6x long-run average. And a 7x EV/EBITDA ratio puts the firm in a similar league to brick-and-mortar companies like Sally Beauty Holdings (NYSE:SBH).These prices make little sense. 1-800-Flowers.com is a capital-light firm with relatively few retail locations; a 3-stage discounted cash flow model (DCF) suggests a justified value closer to $14, not $8.Markets are beginning to agree. Prices of FLWS are up almost 35% in the past month after falling 70% this year — a pattern that suggests a momentum breakout could soon follow.Under Armour (UAA)the exterior of an Under Armour storeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: AShares of Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) have been on a rollercoaster ride since 2014, reaching peaks in 2015, 2019 and 2021, while seeing troughs in 2017, 2020 and 2022. Such volatility dents the firm’s growth and quality scores. Industry-wide issues with supply chain and inventory levels have compounded UAA stock’s retreat from its $27 high this year to $8 today.Under Armour has also fallen behind its competitors in product innovation, instead choosing to pursue the lower-end market. 90% of its North American locations are off-price, according to research by Morningstar analysts.Nevertheless, shares have finally become too cheap for my quant system to ignore. UAA shares trade at 1.75x price-to-sales, less than half of Nike’s (NYSE:NKE) value. And a slight share price recovery in October after a massive H1 fall gives the firm an A+ for momentum.Analysts are also beginning to reverse course on negative estimates. Revenues are now expected to grow in the mid-single digits through 2025. All this points to a potential turnaround for the Maryland-based firm. Though Under Armour will continue on its rollercoaster ride, signs are mounting that it’s now reached a bottom.JetBlue (JBLU)jetblue (JBLU) airplane on a runwaySource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A+| Quality: A| Momentum: B+| Total: AFinally, New York-based Jet Blue (NASDAQ:JBLU) rounds out the list of well-rated stocks under the Profit &amp; Protection system.The company is a growth powerhouse, with 2022 revenues expected to rise 52% on increased travel demand and a merger with Spirit Airlines. Analysts expect operating income to move from a $913 million loss in 2021 to a $405 million gain by 2023. The airline earns a stunning A+ for growth.JetBlue’s valuation is also compelling. After falling 45% this year to $8, the airline’s shares now trade at a 0.27x price-to-sales. Of its rivals, only American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) trades cheaper by that metric.The result: a travel stock with the potential for 100% gains. In mid-October shares of rival United Airlines rose more than 7% after its CEO noted how “consumer appetite for travel is showing no signs of slowing down.” And with oil prices moderating since last summer, shares of JetBlue could have plenty of room for takeoff in the next bull market.Conclusion: When to Buy Penny Stocks?Penny stocks represent some of the highest-risk companies that investors can buy. Not only did shares of under-$5 stocks perform worse than those over $100 during the 2020 market crash. Their volatility is consistently three times higher even in good times, according to data from Thomson Reuters.That makes market timing particularly essential for these low-priced stocks.Today, signs are emerging that the U.S. stock market is beginning to bottom out. Last Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the pace of rate hikes will slow “eventually.” And a relatively tight labor market shows that the U.S. might have avoided a deep recession this time around.It’s never easy to buy penny stocks at the bottom of the market. But concentrating on stocks with certain characteristics will help set investors up for a far better chance at penny stock success.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

21,573b1d28-9ddd-3294-a7f1-32a202414f7c,MMC,2022-11-11,"Should You Be Impressed By Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.'s (NYSE:MMC) ROE?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/impressed-marsh-mclennan-companies-inc-110116246.html,1668164476,STORY,['MMC'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is:35% = US$3.4b ÷ US$9.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35.Does Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has a higher ROE than the average (10%) in the Insurance industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' Debt And Its 35% Return On EquityMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.16. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, MGIC Investment Corp. MTG and Radian Group RDN.Industry: Insurance - Multi-lineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2016864/5-multiline-insurers-to-watch-amid-high-inflation-and-rate-riseProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve the retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., MGIC Investment Corp. and Radian Group. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With five hikes in the interest rate this year so far and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al.The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified, which lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth for non-life insurance operations. Per Deloitte Insights,The Swiss Re Institute estimates an increase in demand for insurance coverage across the globe, in turn driving a 3.9% rise in premiums in 2022. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 4%, while non-life insurance premium is expected to increase 3.7% in 2022.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte.However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made five rate hikes this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. Per Deloitte, so far this year, the number of deals dropped about 30% while deal value dropped by about 25% and estimated to hit a low point. Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs. Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population.At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. Per Deloitte Insights, the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad is:30% = RM653m ÷ RM2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every MYR1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated MYR0.30 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's Earnings Growth And 30% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad over the past five years. growthStory continuesWhen you consider the fact that the industry earnings have shrunk at a rate of 12% in the same period, the company's net income growth is pretty remarkable.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 9.0% (implying that it retains 91% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.While Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 5.5% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad is predicted to decline to 12% despite the anticipated decrease in the payout ratio. We reckon that there could probably be other factors that could be driving the forseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

(NYSE:CRM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 79% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would appreciate the 6.8% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 48%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Salesforce, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Salesforce is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 7.9%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.9% and 4.7% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Marc Benioff directly holds 2.8% of the total shares outstanding.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Salesforce, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$4.9b. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Salesforce   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Agility is really built into our overall plan. On our product side, we can flex the breadth of our portfolio — this quarter to make more sports coats and fewer hoodies.”Ralph Lauren CEO Patrice Louvet.All of the firm’s regions are growing on a constant currency basis, with continued strength in China despite COVID-19 lockdowns there. And the full-price business is offsetting pressure in the company’s outlets.“We’re on offense, we’re focused on gaining share, on recruiting new consumers,” Louvet said, noting the company brought in 1.3 million new consumers in the past quarter.Still, the bottom line couldn’t quite keep up with the go-go days seen a year ago.Ralph Lauren’s net income slipped to $150.2 million, or $2.18 a share, from $193.3 million, or $2.57, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share also slipped, to $2.23 from $2.62 a year earlier, but were better than the $2.08 analysts had penciled in.Shares of the company gained in a generally up day in the market, rising 4.1 percent to $93.95 in midday trading.Story continuesRevenues for the three months ended Oct. 1 increased 5 percent to $1.58 billion from $1.5 billion, a rise of 13 percent in constant currencies.In Asia, sales were up more than 30 percent in constant currencies, while Euope was up in the midteens and North America saw a low-single-digit increase.The gains in Asia stand out as so many brands have had difficulty amid COVID-19 lockdowns in the market, which forced Ralph Lauren to close 35 percent of its stores in Greater China.The overall landscape in China is also changing, with President Xi Jinping consolidating political power and setting a new tone at the top.Louvet noted that Ralph Lauren has been in China for 40 years building deep connections there, with supply chain partners and consumers.“We are indeed excited about the short, mid and long-term opportunity in China,” he said.But China is also not the end-all, be-all of the company’s strategy and the CEO said Ralph Lauren has a “a number of geographic growth opportunities” pointing to the U.S. West Coast.“The reason we just did our show there is not pure luck,” Louvet said, referring to the brand’s first West Coast runway show in the preppy Los Angeles suburb of San Marino, California, last month.As the brand has branched out, it’s also steadily moved up — an evolution keeping with the founder’s philosophy.“Our brand has always been rooted in optimism, inspiring dreams and a sense of possibility,” said Ralph Lauren, executive chairman and chief creative officer. “For more than five decades, people all over the world have connected to these ideas in powerful ways — trusting Ralph Lauren time and again to deliver quality, timelessness and authenticity.”Those foundational traits have helped Ralph Lauren move up the fashion ladder, but Louvet called higher prices an “output” of the company’s moves to elevate, while the inputs include brand building and product offering.Average unit retail prices in the company’s direct-to-consumer network rose 18 percent in the quarter, on top of the 15 percent boost a year ago. Inflation, no doubt, accounts for some of that, and the company put the rest of it down to “a compelling product offering and promotional discipline.”“The consumer is seeing a differentiated proposition from us,” Louvet said.While the CEO said Ralph Lauren has historically been seen alongside “the PVHs and the VFs of the world….We aspire to continue to elevate the company.”“We’re going to continue to make this more of a luxury company,” he said. “That’s the journey we’re on.”(Ralph Lauren is not alone in that journey as others, such as Michael Kors parent Carpi Holdings, have also been pushing toward luxury.)While many fashion companies have significantly reduced their annual outlooks for this year given the stresses of sky-high inflation, higher interest rates and looming recession, Ralph Lauren is largely holding its ground.The company continues to expect its revenues to increase by high-single digits, although adjusted operating margins are seen coming in at the low end of the prior range of 14 to 14.5 percent.To hit those numbers, the firm will have to navigate an increasingly competitive field with more world-weary shoppers and a lot of inventory in the marketplace.“We’re seeing an environment where promotions are starting earlier and they’re heavier than they have been recently,” Louvet said. “That is not our game. We will not jump into a promotional battle just to gain short-term market share because it’s not the kind of share we want to have because it’s not sustainable. I want them to come to the brand because of what we stand for.”By Louvet’s way of thinking, if holding the line leads to a few bad quarters along the way, so be it.So what does keep the CEO up at night?“People are still going to buy clothes, it’s not like the market’s going to go to zero,” he said. “There are still such great share gain opportunities, so how do we drive brand desirability and continue to elevate that? How do we make sure we stay agile with our investments, with our inventory, with our overall resources?“I sleep quite well,” Louvet said.]"

Results have gained from brand strength, solid demand, and expansion across all channels and regions. The company also announced the next phase of its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.23 in the fiscal second quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. However, the bottom line declined 14.9% from the prior-year quarter’s $2.62.Net revenues grew 5% year over year to $1,579.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,560 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 13% from the prior-year quarter. The metric gained from solid growth across all regions. This was partly offset by the impacts of 800 basis points (bps) from adverse currency rates.The company’s global digital ecosystem witnessed year-over-year mid-teens revenue growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of RL have lost 8.2% in the past three months but came ahead of the industry’s decline of 13.5%.Segmental DetailsNorth America: In the fiscal second quarter, the segment’s revenues advanced 3% from the year-ago quarter to $727 million but lagged the consensus mark of $926.3 million. Comparable store sales (comps) for North America’s retail channel remained flat year over year, wherein brick-and-mortar stores remained stable, while digital commerce inched up 1%. Revenues from the North America wholesale business grew 8% year over year.Europe: The segment’s revenues remained flat year over year to $494 million, with a 15% improvement in currency-neutral revenues. The metric also beat the consensus mark of $436.9 million. Comps for the retail channel in Europe were up 3%, whereas brick-and-mortar stores remained flat year over year and digital sales witnessed a 15% rise. Revenues for the segment’s wholesale business rose 9% on a reported basis and 24% at cc.Asia: The segment’s revenues increased 17% year over year to $316 million on a reported and 33% on a currency-neutral basis. The metric missed the consensus mark of $354 million.

However, the metric expanded 310 bps on a three-year basis on solid AUR growth. Improved pricing and promotions were more than offset by increased product costs, higher freight and global supply-chain delays.Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% from the year-ago period to $809 million in the fiscal second quarter. The rise was driven by higher marketing investments, and compensation and selling expenses. Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 100 bps to 51.2% in the reported quarter.The company’s adjusted operating income was $211 million, down 17.6% from $256.6 million in the year-ago quarter.

This includes a 730-bps negative impact of unfavorable currency. On a 53-week comparable basis, the metric is likely to be hurt by an unfavorable currency of 100 bps.The operating margin is forecast to be at the lower end of the earlier mentioned 14-14.5% (cc), which includes a negative impact of unfavorable currency of 200 bps. Notably, it reported an operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week comparable basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis in the last year.The gross margin is envisioned to expand 30-50 bps at cc on a 52-week comparable basis, driven by solid AUR growth and positive product mix, which is expected to more than offset higher freight and product cost inflation. However, the unfavorable currency is likely to hurt the metric by 170 bps.For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits at cc. This includes a 780-bps impact of unfavorable currency.The company anticipates an operating margin of 17.3-17.8% at cc, driven by a robust gross margin. The metric is expected to be hurt by 180 bps of unfavorable currency. Unfavorable currency impacts of 170 bps are likely to dent the gross margin.The effective tax rate for both the third quarter and fiscal 2023 is expected to be 25-26%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector are lululemon athletica LULU, Boyd Gaming BYD and Crocs CROX.lululemon presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

53,ab6325f9-971c-3955-85cd-94f1a8fbc04f,MCO,2022-11-11,Musk Warns Twitter Bankruptcy Possible as Senior Executives Exit,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-warns-twitter-bankruptcy-possible-214601204.html,1668134672,STORY,['MCO'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk, in his first address to Twitter Inc. employees since purchasing the company for $44 billion, said that bankruptcy was a possibility if it doesn’t start generating more cash, according to people familiar with the matter.Most Read from BloombergUkraine Latest: Biden Says Missile Likely Not Fired From RussiaPoland Says Russian-Made Missile Hit Territory and Killed Two PeopleTrump Makes His 2024 Run Official, Defies Calls to Move OnMusk Steps Up Purge of Twitter Engineers Who Criticize HimBiden Says Unlikely Rocket That Hit Poland Was Fired From RussiaThe warning came amid a tumultuous start to Musk’s reign at the social media company -- a two-week period in which he has fired half of Twitter’s staff, ushered out most of the top executives and ordered the remaining employees to stop working from home. One executive who until Thursday had emerged as part of Musk’s new leadership team, Yoel Roth, departed, people familiar with the situation said. Another, Robin Wheeler, also resigned -- but Musk persuaded her to stay on, said some of the people, who requested anonymity to protect personal and professional relationships.While the buyout has removed Twitter from the scrutiny of public markets, Musk loaded the company with almost $13 billion of debt that’s now in the hands of seven Wall Street banks that have been unable to offload it to investors.Confidence in the company has eroded so rapidly that, even before Musk’s bankruptcy comments, some funds were offering to buy the loans for as little as 60 cents on the dollar -- a price typically reserved for companies deemed in financial distress, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.In his address to staff, Musk issued multiple dour warnings. Employees should brace for 80-hour work weeks. There will be fewer office perks like free food. And he ended the pandemic-era flexibility that allowed employees to work from home.“If you don’t want to come, resignation accepted,” he said, according to a person familiar with the matter.Story continuesWhen he was asked about the prospect of attrition, Musk said, “We all need to be more hardcore.”In discussing Twitter’s finances and future, Musk said the company needed to move with urgency to make its $8 subscription product, Twitter Blue, something users will want to pay for, given a pullback by advertisers who are concerned about harmful content.Musk has in the past used the threat of financial ruin in an attempt to motivate workers, according to a person familiar with his management style. He’s trying to convey the notion that if people don’t work hard, Twitter will be left in a very difficult spot, this person said.The Information and Platformer earlier reported Musk’s bankruptcy statement.He also hinted at products he’d like to introduce, including payments, ads that are more conversational and interest-bearing checking accounts. Onboarding to the Twitter app should be smoother, as is the case with TikTok, he said.Earlier Thursday, Twitter’s chief information security officer, chief privacy officer and chief compliance officer departed, raising concerns about the company’s ability to keep its platform secure and comply with regulations. Twitter is currently bound by a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission that regulates how the company handles user data, and could be subject to fines for violations.Roth had since taken over all of the social network’s Trust and Safety efforts, while Wheeler, a sales vice president, had recently stepped up to oversee relations with jittery advertisers. She hinted at her decision to stay in a tweet, as well as a post on an internal Slack channel.The debt Twitter took on to finance Musk’s buyout is leaving it with interest costs that, by one estimate, will surge to $1.2 billion a year.The social network has seen a pullback from some advertisers that are concerned about Musk’s plans for content moderation.Debt investors and credit raters are also showing little confidence. The company’s banks have been quietly sounding out hedge funds and other asset managers for their interest in buying a chunk of the company’s debt.Discussions so far have centered around the $6.5 billion leveraged loan portion of the financing, people with knowledge of the talks said. Banks had seemed unwilling to sell for any price below 70 cents on the dollar, according to one of the people. Even at that level, losses could run into the billions of dollars, Bloomberg calculations show.Moody’s Investors Service, meanwhile, recently cut Twitter’s credit rating deeper into junk territory. “Twitter’s governance risk is highly negative reflecting Moody’s expectation for aggressive financial policies and concentrated ownership by Elon Musk,” the ratings firm said.Musk in an email late Wednesday warned employees of “difficult times ahead,” with “no way to sugarcoat the message” about the economic outlook for the company. He ended employees’ ability to work remotely unless he personally approved it.--With assistance from Lisa Lee, Katie Roof, Davide Scigliuzzo, Gillian Tan, Claire Ruckin and Jill R.

58,1ff4c495-913b-3dc6-8e0c-52fccc5c5ff1,MSFT,2022-11-11,Growth Investors: Industry Analysts Just Upgraded Their Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Revenue Forecasts By 0.2%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/growth-investors-industry-analysts-just-123553430.html,1668170153,STORY,['MSFT'],"[Celebrations may be in order for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders, with the analysts delivering a significant upgrade to their statutory estimates for the company. The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose, with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects. The market may be pricing in some blue sky too, with the share price gaining 13% to US$243 in the last 7 days. We'll be curious to see if these new estimates convince the market to lift the stock price higher still.Following the upgrade, the most recent consensus for Microsoft from its 44 analysts is for revenues of US$213b in 2023 which, if met, would be an okay 4.9% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Prior to the latest estimates, the analysts were forecasting revenues of US$213b in 2023. Overall it looks like Microsoft is performing in line with analyst expectations, given the analysts have updated their numbers and there's been no real change to this year's forecast following these updates. View our latest analysis for Microsoft earnings-and-revenue-growthThere was no particular change to the consensus price target of US$297, with Microsoft's latest outlook seemingly not enough to result in a change of valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Microsoft analyst has a price target of US$411 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$234. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Microsoft's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2023 expected to display 6.5% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 14% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.4% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Microsoft.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that analysts reconfirmed their revenue estimates for this year, suggesting that the business is performing in line with market expectations. They're also anticipating slower revenue growth than the wider market. Given that analysts appear to be expecting substantial improvement in the sales pipeline, now could be the right time to take another look at Microsoft.Using these estimates as a starting point, we've run a discounted cash flow calculation (DCF) on Microsoft that suggests the company could be somewhat undervalued.

The company will be the first in the S&amp;P 500 to include disability representation as a separate, standalone metric within a disclosed incentive plan.The goal is a core component of the company’s expanded U.S. health equity performance goal, which focuses on positively impacting key areas of health and wellbeing, especially for disproportionally impacted, underserved communities, including women, people of color and people with disabilities.""We are very proud of our pioneering leadership in disability inclusion,"" said Holly May, executive vice president and global chief human resources officer, Walgreens Boots Alliance. ""By increasing our representation of people with disabilities, we are continuing to unlock a critical talent pipeline, providing sustainable work to this underrepresented community, and as such helping to address a number of social determinants of health including economic instability, social isolation and unemployment.""To further support these efforts, the company has formed a partnership with Neurodiversity in the Workplace™ (NITW), which designs plans and programs for companies to recruit, attract, hire and retain neurodiverse talent. The first cohort is expected to begin work at WBA’s global support office in Deerfield, Ill., in early 2023.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employees with disabilities are three times more likely than employees without disabilities to be unemployed.

""Cups and plastics and dairy, and you know, even the ice and making the ice out of the ice machine has gotten more expensive.""Hinting toward some relief in the future, he said, ""We're seeing the market start to come down so you should see some relief in coffee pricing ... probably into the first half of next year.""At the end of the day though, the CEO says Dutch Bros is mindful of passing price increases onto consumers and keeping a close eye on its competition like Starbucks, which raised prices by about 5% over a 12-month period.Story continues""I think other competitors have been a little bit more aggressive with pricing, but we've tried to be careful with the customer and how we've managed that.""Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If you want to see more of the cheapest stocks on Robinhood, go directly to 5 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood.Robinhood is a trading app famous for offering free trades on stocks as a business model. Instead of making money from commissions, Robinhood makes money from interest, margin lending, payment for order flow and more.As a result of saving people substantial amounts in commissions, Robinhood is one of the largest brokers in the world today with 12.2 million monthly active users and 22.9 million net funded accounts as of Q3 2022.Recently, Robinhood stocks launched an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. Although some stocks in the popular 100 are meme stocks, some could be considered cheap in the long term given their competitive advantages and high quality businesses.20222022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Given inflation is still high, many analysts think the U.S. central bank could raise rates further.If rates go up, aggregate demand could decrease and demand for individual companies could weaken in the near term. Although the market has already priced in some of the economic slowdown, there could still be downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood, we took some of the most popular stocks in Robinhood that trade below the analyst average price target. To filter out meme stocks, we ensured that each stock had competitive advantages and scale.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares on the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.Story continues12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood12. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares have fallen substantially since the beginning of the pandemic given the decline in air travel. Although the company could face near term headwinds given macro headwinds, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) still has long term earnings growth potential given its scale and competitive advantages. Analysts have an average price target of $187.12 versus the price of $168.74 as of 11/9.Alongside Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the cheapest stocks that's popular on Robinhood.11. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has fallen 21.7% year to date due to the broader market weakness and macro headwinds. Nevertheless, some analysts such as David Palmer of Evercore ISI are bullish. Palmer has a $97 price target and an 'Outperform' rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) given his estimate of the company earning $3.39 in FY23 EPS. In the long term, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has high quality earnings potential that could justify a potentially higher valuation.10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Although Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares are down nearly 21% year to date, the company is a leader in R&amp;D given its development of Paxlovid. With a substantial product pipeline, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has potential for EPS growth in the future even if Wall Street is expecting the company's earnings per share to decline by an average of 1.8% per year for the next 5 years. With a forward P/E of around 9, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) could be a cheap stock in the long term.9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Although NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares are down almost 45% year to date due to rising inventories and increasing costs, the company nevertheless has a very strong brand. If macroeconomic conditions normalize, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) may be able to adjust with potentially more sales.Leaven Partners commented on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year. Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Given near term headwinds, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has fallen 53% year to date. According to Rajvindra Gill of Needham's analysis, there could be weaker than expected demand for semiconductor stocks in general in the trough part of the industry cycle. The broader market has also been weak. Nevertheless, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could still be a long term growth stock if it can achieve its potential. Analysts have an average price target of $190.5 per share for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) .7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Although a recession would be a headwind for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the near term, Carleton English of Barron's believes Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) along with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo could handle one assuming that it's not severe. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s balance sheet is stronger than it was several years ago and the bank has substantial long term earnings power. Analysts have an average price target of $41.1 per share for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares fell 13.16% on Wednesday after the company missed on earnings and the company guided for slower than expected growth for next year. Nevertheless, some analysts are still bullish. Shortly after the earnings report, Philip Cusick of JPMorgan cut his price target to $135 from $145, but still retained an 'Overweight' rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Visa Inc.

For Parker-Hannifin, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $3,656.97, or a gain of 265.70%, as of November 10, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 171.67% and gold's return of -5.46% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PH.Strong demand across end markets and higher orders bodes well for Parker-Hannifin. Pricing actions and benefits from the Win strategy support the company’s margin performance. The Meggitt acquisition is contributing significantly to Aerospace sales. The company has increased its organic growth and earnings forecast for fiscal 2023 to consider the benefits of the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to add 45 cents per share to Parker-Hannifin’s adjusted earnings in fiscal 2023. The company’s measures to reward shareholders are encouraging. Due to these tailwinds, shares of the company have outperformed its industry in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Parker-Hannifin’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward in the past 60 days. However, the rising cost of sales is concerning for the company.The stock is up 14.24% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 6 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) share price is up 63% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 40% (ignoring dividends).Since the stock has added US$1.4b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. View our latest analysis for Roper Technologies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Roper Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.9% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 10% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Roper Technologies the TSR over the last 5 years was 68%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Roper Technologies shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 14% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 24%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 11% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start.

(NYSE:HCA) insiders who bought shares over the past year were rewarded handsomely last week. The stock rose 4.6%, resulting in a US$2.8b rise in the company's market capitalisation. As a result, the stock they originally bought for US$19m is now worth US$20m.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare HCA Healthcare Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Founder &amp; Chairman Emeritus Thomas Frist for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$215 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$223. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for HCA Healthcare share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 91.70k shares for US$19m. But insiders sold 49.56k shares worth US$12m. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by HCA Healthcare insiders.

In total, insiders sold US$3.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes HCA Healthcare Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that HCA Healthcare insiders own 1.3% of the company, worth about US$826m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At HCA Healthcare Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought HCA Healthcare stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. But we take heart from prior transactions. And insider ownership remains quite considerable. So the recent selling doesn't worry us. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing HCA Healthcare. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with HCA Healthcare (including 1 which is concerning).But note: HCA Healthcare may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Jason Brady, president and CEO of Thornburg Investment Management, joined CNBC’s ‘The Exchange’ on November 8, where he noted that growth stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are now trading in value territory after losing billions in market capitalization this year alone. He contended that although the future of Meta hinges upon the ROI from its hefty metaverse investment, it is still a cash flow positive operation in terms of core business categories. However, he warned investors to be careful when viewing every beaten down stock as a buying opportunity, to save themselves from value traps. In the beginning of November, value stocks posted large gains compared to their growth counterparts. The Russell 1000 Value index climbed 10.1% in October, outperforming its growth peers by 4.3%. Similarly, The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) saw inflows of $444 million last month during the rally. Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, told CNBC on November 3: “We continue to prefer value over growth, with growth in the middle of a perfect storm of higher rates + weakening fundamentals. Value factors have also historically benefitted from year-end seasonality.”Some of the best value stocks in the Goldman Sachs portfolio include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 value stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to Goldman Sachs’ stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashGoldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top Stock Picks10.

(NYSE:HD) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $312 from $330 as part of a broader research note on Home Improvement names. Mixed signals across the housing sector make the forward demand outlook uncertain, although Q3 comps are likely to have held significantly firm for The Home Depot, Inc.

(NYSE:HD) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 75 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:HD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”9. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $1,299,884,000P/E Ratio as of November 10: 15.57Cisco Systems, Inc.

Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Goldman Sachs’ Stake Value: $1,322,375,000P/E Ratio as of November 10: 14.29 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the leading semiconductor firms in the world.

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the top value stocks in the Goldman Sachs portfolio. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industry wide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:12 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy NowTop 10 Real Estate Stocks To Buy13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

So this year's winners were the top, ""Masters of the Universe,"" and Lite-Brite, but there were a few on the nominee list that I liked a bit more. Now, my pick, the pinata. I'm like, how was that not a win? That's joy for everybody and candy. And you know, you get to hit things. That's fantastic.And then for those who love a bit of art, the Spirograph. It made you actually feel like you are good at art, even if you were trash like I was. But it gave me my confidence. I think they should have made it in there. What about you, Seana?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Rachelle, it's interesting. When you take a look at this, a lot of these toys are still popular today. The retro toys, we talked about nostalgia, so many people buying these types of toys during the pandemic and part of the reason why the companies couldn't stock the shelves fast enough.So I wasn't necessarily surprised by what entered the Hall of Fame this year, but Bingo, Pound Puppies, and Nerf were three things that I thought maybe should have been included and, I think, will likely be included at some point in the future, especially Bingo when you talk about the total sales of that game over the last several decades and the relevance today, the popularity of Bingo playing out in so many locations today. So it certainly makes a lot of sense.My favorite though was the American Girl Dolls, which was actually entered into the Hall of Fame last year, which I think makes a lot of sense. But I think it's hard to choose. There obviously are so many hit games out there. It's about time that top made it in. Maybe we'll see some of the ones that we personally like over the next couple of years.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, I did see that Nintendo's Gameboy had made it in there before as well, which makes sense, because a lot of the ways that they judged it, it wasn't just whether the toy was fun. It was things like confidence, like they talked about in ""Masters of the Universe,"" if you used to watch ""He-Man"" cartoons as a kid like I did, what it did for your confidence, to feel strong, to feel empowered.So they really take a holistic view when they look at some of these toys, which explains why American Girl Dolls made it in. You get to see yourself represented and with different kinds of hairstyles and clothing and culture. So I love the idea of this. And I'm a-- my daughter, she's only nine, but she's a big '80s kid. So she has a Lite-Brite. I try and make her play a lot of board games so I can live vicariously. And ""Operation"" is another really fantastic one.SEANA SMITH: Ooh, ""Operation."" I played that. I never had a Lite-Brite as a kid, but I hear it's a lot of fun. And certainly, it's popular. It's even popular today. People are still buying them, like you and like for your daughter.]"
84,43c81f08-50d5-30d1-bff5-21e47d7b72ee,MAT,2022-11-11,"Is Mattel, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MAT) 31% ROE Strong Compared To Its Industry?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mattel-inc-nasdaq-mat-31-183448963.html,1668105288.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Mattel How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mattel is:31% = US$604m ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.31 in profit.Does Mattel Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Mattel has a similar ROE to the average in the Leisure industry classification (32%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Mattel by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Mattel's Debt And Its 31% Return On EquityMattel clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.31. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Mattel may not be the best stock to buy.

85,11a4d5f3-a3d7-3b56-8057-67f0dd3fd5ad,SLB,2022-11-11,Schlumberger Limited (SLB) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limited-slb-attracting-investor-140002232.html,1668088802,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +26.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 19.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share, indicating a change of +65.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +66.4%. This estimate has changed +5.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.99 indicates a change of +40.3% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $7.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.3%. The $27.81 billion and $32.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.3% and +17%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.9%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.36 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.14 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.67%. The EPS surprise was +14.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

86,f3d1f4a2-e897-3432-8dde-1be1c2691d44,PRGO,2022-11-11,‘Long-term investors should turn back toward stocks’: J.P. Morgan says inflation has peaked and suggests 2 stocks to buy,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/long-term-investors-turn-back-151253964.html,1668093173,STORY,['PRGO'],"[For well over a year now, we’ve been seeing headlines about inflation. The rate of price increases is running at its highest level since the early 1980s, although the October numbers, just released, showed it cooling off to 7.7% over the past 12 months.Covering the markets from investment giant JPMorgan, asset management investment chief David Kelly believes the trends are favorable looking forward. From June to October, the annualized inflation rate dropped from 9.1% to 7.7%, leading him to say, “Inflation has already peaked. I think it is going to gradually fall.”A pullback in inflation would help boost stocks, and Kelly believe, “This is a time to be overweight equities for the long-term investor.""The stock analysts at JPMorgan are following Kelly’s lead, and picking out equities that they see as likely winners in the long-term. After running two of these stocks through TipRanks’ database, we found out that the rest of the Street is also on board. Let's take a closer look.Perrigo Company (PRGO)We'll start with Perrigo, a leading manufacturer of generic label over-the-counter drugs, a major niche when you consider that 9 out of 10 US prescriptions are filled with generics. A large part of Perrigo’s product lineup comes from its dermatology portfolio; Perrigo has the largest portfolio of generic dermatological products in the US.The company realized total revenues of $1.1 billion in the recently reported 3Q22, for a 5.5% year-over-year gain. On earnings, the adjusted diluted EPS came in at 56 cents, up 24% y/y. The consumer self-care segment led the company’s revenues, with $722 million of the total; upper respiratory medications came in second, with $132 million. The skin care portfolio brought in a total of $49 million in revenues.While Perrigo brought in solid revenues, investors were disappointed that the results missed the forecast. The top line as reported missed by ~3%, while the diluted EPS missed its 67-cent estimate by ~16%.Story continuesIn a bright spot for investors, Perrigo’s miss on earnings and revenues did not prevent the company from keeping up its reliable dividend. The 26-cent common share payment is scheduled to go out on December 20; at its current rate, the dividend annualizes to $1.04 and yields 3.2%. That’s 1.5x higher than the market average for dividend yields – and the company has a 9-year history of gradually increasing the payment.Covering Perrigo for JPMorgan, analyst Chris Schott is upbeat overall on the company's path forward.“We continue to see several positive tailwinds that should eventually translate into improved results (full HRA contribution and synergies, pricing gains, gross margin improvements, etc.). And while [the] setback on earnings is disappointing, PRGO is again trading well below consumer peers despite a pathway to very health margin recovery/earnings growth over the next several years,” Schott noted.In line with this optimistic stance, Schott gives PRGO shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, with a $51 price target that suggests it has a 53% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Schott’s track record, click here)Wall Street must be in agreement with JPM’s bullish stance on Perrigo, as the company’s stock has picked up 4 recent analyst reviews – and they are unanimously positive for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is trading for $33.08 and its current average price target, $48.25, implies a one-year gain of 45%. (See PRGO stock analysis on TipRanks)TPI Composites (TPIC)Now we’ll turn to the industrial sector, where TCI Composites has built a name for itself in the composite materials niche. These are high-tech manufacturing materials, used in applications, such as sailboats and motorboats, that require lightweight, high-strength, high-performance structural components. The company’s materials are also found in wind turbine blades; TCI is a leader in the global market for high-end composite turbine blades, and has manufactured over 75,000 such blades over the past two decades. The company sells approximately 32% of all wind turbine blades use globally, outside of the Chinese market.Despite holding a strong position in wind turbine market – a market that can boast of strong support from social and political pressures – TPI reported a y/y decline in revenues in a 3Q22 report that showed the top line missing estimates and the bottom line coming in at a loss.The company reported revenues of 459.3 million, down 4.2% y/y, and a net loss per common share of 39 cents. This second metric was actually not as severe as the 83-cent EPS loss reported in the year-ago period; but it was deeper than the 30 cents analysts has expected.JPMorgan's 5-star analyst Mark Strouse points out that this interesting industrial firm is facing headwinds due to restrictions in the Chinese market, and is restructuring in response.Nevertheless, Strouse sees a path forward for TPI, and goes on to say, “Encouragingly, visibility into 2024 and beyond has begun to improve, aided by a new agreement (soon to be formally contracted) with GE for US manufacturing to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, and extensions of all international contracts that were previously slated to expire at year-end. Despite the still weak environment, we are encouraged by the improved long-term outlook, which we expect to enhance further in early-23 once the US Treasury provides IRA guidelines…""""We continue to recommend TPIC to value investors seeking exposure to the Alt Energy space and to the US IRA,” the analyst summed up.Strouse thinks the stock has some way to go, and by some way, we mean 96% of upside. Those are the returns investors are looking at, should the stock make it all the way to Dolliver’s $21 price target. No need to add, the analyst’s rating is an Overweight (i.e. Buy). (To watch Strouse’s track record, click here)Overall, TPI has earned a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 8 recent reviews that include 5 Buys and 3 Holds. The shares have a trading price of $10.70 and their $17.86 average price target implies a gain of ~67% on the one-year horizon.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, MGIC Investment Corp. MTG and Radian Group RDN.Industry: Insurance - Multi-lineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2016864/5-multiline-insurers-to-watch-amid-high-inflation-and-rate-riseProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve the retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., MGIC Investment Corp. and Radian Group. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With five hikes in the interest rate this year so far and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al.The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified, which lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth for non-life insurance operations. Per Deloitte Insights,The Swiss Re Institute estimates an increase in demand for insurance coverage across the globe, in turn driving a 3.9% rise in premiums in 2022. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 4%, while non-life insurance premium is expected to increase 3.7% in 2022.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte.However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made five rate hikes this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. Per Deloitte, so far this year, the number of deals dropped about 30% while deal value dropped by about 25% and estimated to hit a low point. Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs. Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population.At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. Per Deloitte Insights, the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term.

Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, MGIC Investment Corporation MTG and Radian Group RDN. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With five hikes in the interest rate this year so far and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified, which lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth for non-life insurance operations. Per Deloitte Insights, The Swiss Re Institute estimates an increase in demand for insurance coverage across the globe, in turn driving a 3.9% rise in premiums in 2022. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 4%, while non-life insurance premium is expected to increase 3.7% in 2022.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte. However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made five rate hikes this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. Per Deloitte, so far this year, the number of deals dropped about 30% while deal value dropped by about 25% and estimated to hit a low point.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. Per Deloitte Insights, the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +12% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has gained 7.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $4.10 per share, indicating a change of +39.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.93 points to a change of +214.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.99 indicates a change of -33.1% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Phillips 66.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $165.41 billion and $149.55 billion estimates indicate +44% and -9.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $48.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.9%. EPS of $6.46 for the same period compares with $3.18 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.49%. The EPS surprise was +29.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

98,3723bc01-6128-3eb3-a699-04599d756374,PSX,2022-11-11,Marathon (MPC) Stock Rises Since Q3 Earnings Beat: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-mpc-stock-rises-since-134901213.html,1668088141,STORY,"['MPC', 'PSX', 'VLO', 'MUSA']","[The stock of independent oil refiner and marketer, Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, has gained 2% since its third-quarter results were announced on Nov 1. The positive response could be attributed to the company’s comfortable earnings beat and its declaration of a dividend hike.What Did Marathon Petroleum’s Earnings Unveil?Marathon Petroleum reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.80 and compared with a profit of merely 73 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $4.6 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.2%.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.2 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.7 billion and improved 44.8% year over year.In October, the company completed its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp;i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion. Currently, MPC has remaining authorization of $5 billion with no expiration date.In more good news for investors, MPC’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 75 cents per share to its common shareholders of record on Nov 16. The payout, which represents a 30% sequential increase, will be made on Dec 12.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $4.6 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $509 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and throughputs.Specifically, the refining margin of $30.21 per barrel improved significantly from $14.51 a year ago. Total refined product sales volumes were 3,587 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from 3,539 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput rose from 2,836 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 3,007 mbpd and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,932 mbpd. Capacity utilization during the quarter was up from last year’s 93% to 98%.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, 12.9% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. Earnings were supported by stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetMarathon Petroleum, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported expenses of $40.6 billion in third-quarter 2022, rising 29.7% from the year-ago quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $789 million on capital programs (56% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 34% on the Midstream segment) compared to $464 million in the year-ago period. As of Sep 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 44.9%.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MPC’s third-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.46, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.98. The bottom line also more than doubled from a profit of $3.18 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins surged to $26.58 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $8.57. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $38.76 and $19.22 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $12.47 and $9.27, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, Phillips 66 saw the metric jump to $21.29 per barrel from $5.75 in the prior-year quarter. The West Coast witnessed an increase in margins from $7.46 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $28.64 in the September-end quarter of 2022.Another refining giant Valero Energy VLO reported adjusted earnings of $7.14 per share compared to a meager $1.22 in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7 per share. VLO’s strong quarterly results were supported by increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin.For the quarter, Valero’s refining throughput volumes were 3,005 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d), up from 2,864 MBbls/d in third-quarter 2021. Meanwhile, VLO’s refining margin per barrel of throughput increased to $21.34 from the year-ago level of $10.07.Then we have Murphy USA MUSA, whose third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $9.28 handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 and improved significantly from the year-earlier bottom line of $3.98. MUSA’s outperformance could be attributed to a rise in the retail gasoline price and a higher retail margin of 37.6 cents per gallon, up 41.4% year over year.Merchandise sales, at $1 billion, rose 7.7% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $983 million. However, Murphy USA’s revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $5.1 billion, falling 3.7% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but up 42.1% from the third quarter of 2021.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TJX) shareholders after stock gained 3.9%, they should consider it with a grain of salt. Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$23m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TJX CompaniesThe Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$74.00). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 21% of Carol Meyrowitz's holding.In total, TJX Companies insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

In total, insiders sold US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of TJX CompaniesLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. TJX Companies insiders own about US$148m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The TJX Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought TJX Companies stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since TJX Companies is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-know-amgen-inc-101421625.html,1668161661,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Amgen's shares before the 16th of November in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 8th of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.94 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$7.76 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Amgen has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current share price of $291.01. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Amgen paid out more than half (60%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 46% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Amgen's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Amgen earnings per share are up 4.4% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Amgen has increased its dividend at approximately 18% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Amgen got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been modest and Amgen paid out over half of its profits and less than half of its free cash flow, although both payout ratios are within normal limits. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Amgen today.In light of that, while Amgen has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Amgen and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

103,d015ff1a-c52f-3548-96ba-8d59e1a22889,PEG,2022-11-11,Is Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated's (NYSE:PEG) ROE Of 5.2% Concerning?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/public-enterprise-group-incorporateds-nyse-174834280.html,1668102514,STORY,['PEG'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Public Service Enterprise Group is:5.2% = US$688m ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.05.Does Public Service Enterprise Group Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Public Service Enterprise Group has a lower ROE than the average (8.8%) in the Integrated Utilities industry.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for Public Service Enterprise Group.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesPublic Service Enterprise Group's Debt And Its 5.2% ROEPublic Service Enterprise Group clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.50. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Public Service Enterprise Group may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

105,4d37b317-034c-362f-9f85-e3b6d57922b3,M,2022-11-11,Macy's (M) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-m-expected-beat-earnings-150003554.html,1668092403,STORY,['M'],"[The market expects Macy's (M) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 17, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -84.6%.Revenues are expected to be $5.18 billion, down 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Macy's?For Macy's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +18.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Macy's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Macy's would post earnings of $0.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +17.65%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Macy's appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In regional business centre Dubai, Caesars Palace currently has a resort without a casino and MGM Resorts International is building a resort.(Reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

(NYSE:NEE) insiders have a reason to boast after seeing a US$644k addition to their US$6.5m investment",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nyse-nee-110054900.html,1668164454,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) insiders who bought shares over the past year were rewarded handsomely last week. The stock rose 6.4%, resulting in a US$10.0b rise in the company's market capitalisation. As a result, the stock they originally bought for US$6.5m is now worth US$7.2m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider James Robo for US$5.0m worth of shares, at about US$77.26 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$83.20. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for NextEra Energy share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.NextEra Energy insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. NextEra Energy insiders own about US$276m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About NextEra Energy Insiders?The fact that there have been no NextEra Energy insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like NextEra Energy insiders think the business has merit. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing NextEra Energy. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for NextEra Energy (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.But note: NextEra Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Assets Trust AAT, American Electric Power AEP, BCB Bancorp NJ BCBP, Conagra Brands CAG and NextEra Energy Partners NEP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2022 &amp; BeyondTraditionally, stocks tend to scale up after midterm elections. In reality, the stock market tends to perform better amid gridlock in Washington, or if there is some sort of split government. Thus, investors were expecting Republicans to gain ground, which so far has failed to materialize.The outcome of the battle over the control of the U.S. Senate and House remains unclear, but chances of a so-called “red wave” appears to have been more or less ruined. No doubt, the stock market ended in the negative territory on Nov 9, a day after Americans voted to decide who controls Congress.Major stock indexes, incidentally, have jumped up this year as the Federal Reserve tightened its monetary policy to curb stubbornly high inflation. Needless to say, a rate hike impacts consumer spending levels and consequently economic growth.This month, nonetheless, the Fed has approved its fourth successive three-quarter-point rate hike, thereby taking the interest rate to between 3.75% and 4%. In fact, interest rates are expected to increase further in December and beyond, thanks to recent better-than-anticipated payroll numbers.Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell categorically mentioned that it’s “premature” to think about pausing interest rate hikes since core inflationary pressure continues to rise at a painful pace. Per the U.S. Labor Department, the core consumer price index for the month of September soared 6.6% year over year, its biggest 12-month jump since 1982.Story continuesAdditionally, investors are now anxious that a likely bankruptcy of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange may adversely impact the already battered stock market. However, investors shouldn’t freak out!Instead, they should place their bets on dividend-paying stocks like American Assets Trust, American Electric Power, BCB Bancorp NJ, Conagra Brands and NextEra Energy Partners for a steady stream of income this year and beyond.Thanks to a fundamentally sound business model, dividend-paying stocks remain protected from market vagaries.

Investors have to seek it out amidst other industries including solar and chemicals. Sometimes, you may simply stumble across a company innovating in alternative energy just by taking a look at some top Zacks Ranked stocks.That makes it difficult to know what is “alternative energy” and what isn’t.The Lithium ProducersBut some industries are more obvious than others. Lithium is used in electric vehicle batteries. It’s becoming an important part of the EV infrastructure.SQM SQM is a Chilean producer who is one of the largest lithium producers in the world. Earnings of SQM are expected to soar 530% this year as lithium prices have tripled.SQM is cheap, as earnings soar, with a forward P/E of just 7.6.Albemarle ALB is also a lithium producer but it is headquartered in the United States.

It also pays a dividend, currently yielding 0.6%.Should lithium be on your radar?Is it Finally Time for Solar? An obvious area for alternative energy is solar. But investors have been waiting many years for solar to finally take off. It only generates 3% of the US energy.Story continues2023 could be the year for solar.JinkoSolar JKS, a Chinese solar company, is up 4.3% year-to-date. JinkoSolar shares are cheap.

Could they be a legitimate alternative energy play?Pioneer Natural Resources PXD, for example, has 2 renewable projects that will provide power to the company’s Permian Basin and Texas electric grid. It participates in the 160 MW Concho Valley Solar project.Pioneer Natural Resources is also working with NextEra Energy NEE to develop a 140 MW wind generation facility on Pioneer Natural Resources’ land in Midland, Texas.NextEra Energy is a Florida clean energy company with a market cap of $153 billion.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Alternative Energy Stocks To Buy Now. Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, told Bloomberg on November 8 that renewable energy assets are set for explosive growth, since they are the solution to both energy security risks and climate change. Carney is also a vice chair at Brookfield Asset Management, and he noted that smart investors are following “an absolute wall of opportunity in just rolling out clean energy at scale.”Europe is facing a harsh winter, and the global leaders are on the fence about how to distribute the capital in energy markets. Some advocate that investors need to pour more money into oil, gas, and coal to increase energy supplies swiftly. Others argue that it is high time to boost spending on renewables as the world is already battling with global climate change.At the beginning of November, the United States and the United Arab Emirates announced a renewable energy pact which could result in $100 billion of investments globally. The partnership is developed to create 100 gigawatts of renewable power by 2035, which is about twice the capacity that was generated in Europe and North America combined in 2020. To benefit from the boom in the alternative energy sector, some of the best stocks to buy include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), and First Solar, Inc.

Sunnova is a residential solar and energy storage company that enables adoption through a network of installers with options for financing, service and broader home energy management. Rising interest rates and solar energy supply constraints weighed on the stock’s performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 but created a compelling valuation opportunity to buy this business when the market was embedding low growth expectations. We believe Sunnova will deliver value accretive growth for a much longer time, with its downside limited by the long-term, fixed-rate, high- quality contracts it has with customers.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Alternative Energy Stocks To Buy Now.

In reality, the stock market tends to perform better amid gridlock in Washington, or if there is some sort of split government. Thus, investors were expecting Republicans to gain ground, which so far has failed to materialize.The outcome of the battle over the control of the U.S. Senate and House remains unclear, but chances of a so-called “red wave” appears to have been more or less ruined. No doubt, the stock market ended in the negative territory on Nov 9, a day after Americans voted to decide who controls Congress.Major stock indexes, incidentally, have jumped up this year as the Federal Reserve tightened its monetary policy to curb stubbornly high inflation. Needless to say, a rate hike impacts consumer spending levels and consequently economic growth.This month, nonetheless, the Fed has approved its fourth successive three-quarter-point rate hike, thereby taking the interest rate to between 3.75% and 4%. In fact, interest rates are expected to increase further in December and beyond, thanks to recent better-than-anticipated payroll numbers.Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell categorically mentioned that it’s “premature” to think about pausing interest rate hikes since core inflationary pressure continues to rise at a painful pace. Per the U.S. Labor Department, the core consumer price index for the month of September soared 6.6% year over year, its biggest 12-month jump since 1982.Additionally, investors are now anxious that a likely bankruptcy of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange may adversely impact the already battered stock market. However, investors shouldn’t freak out!Instead, they should place their bets on dividend-paying stocks like American Assets Trust AAT, American Electric Power AEP, BCB Bancorp NJ BCBP, Conagra Brands CAG and NextEra Energy Partners NEP for a steady stream of income this year and beyond.Thanks to a fundamentally sound business model, dividend-paying stocks remain protected from market vagaries.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.NRG Energy and NextEra Energy are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that NRG's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.NRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 3.77, while NEE has a forward P/E of 27.04. We also note that NRG has a PEG ratio of 0.31. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.80.Another notable valuation metric for NRG is its P/B ratio of 2.03. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NEE has a P/B of 3.33.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, NRG holds a Value grade of A, while NEE has a Value grade of D.NRG stands above NEE thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that NRG is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As the global economy continues to go digital, a new report from global nonprofit Accion and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth shows what small businesses and their clients can gain from digitalization and demonstrates how digital tools designed for small businesses can advance economic inclusion.The report presents learnings from a four-year program, launched in 2019 and continuing through the COVID-19 global pandemic, in which Accion, supported by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, worked with nine financial service providers and 50 fintech startups around the world to help small businesses leverage digital tools. The findings demonstrate the importance of accelerating the digital transformation of small businesses, which account for 90 percent of businesses worldwide and create seven out of 10 jobs in emerging markets.Over a four-year period:Digital adoption increased among women entrepreneurs. Women accounted for 75 percent of new product users, demonstrating the potential of digital tools to expand access to financial services for women and other underserved people.Financial health improved. Nearly 80 percent of product users interviewed across five countries reported increased capacity to manage financial challenges, including the ability to repay loans on time or access credit for their business needs, which they attributed to products developed by the partnership.Digital tools boosted productivity and growth. Digital product users reported a 30 percent increase in business growth activities with more than 61 percent linking these improvements, at least partially, to the digital products used.30-day usage of digital tools by unique users increased by 400 percent, showing that people were not only accessing the tools but consistently using them. Tools included products designed to support financial literacy, digital savings, and short-term loans for underserved businesses.Story continuesAs the program concludes, the report reveals that more than 11.5 million people benefited from digital transformation, including more than 4.4 million micro and small businesses that now use digital tools on a regular basis. From April 2021 to April 2022, the number of active digital users (one year active) increased by more than 1.1 million across all program partners, with 800,000 added in the final six months alone.Michael Schlein, President and CEO of Accion, said: ""Small businesses are the backbone of local communities, and the rapidly digitizing economy presents new opportunities to provide them with more and better financial services. We have shown that when financial service providers and fintechs design digital products and services that meet the needs of micro and small businesses and their clients, people will use them. We're excited by the potential of these products to improve the financial wellbeing and resilience of millions of people around the world.""""Our work with Accion shows that digital financial tools can be game-changers for small businesses and the people around the world who run them,"" said Shamina Singh, Founder and President of the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. ""The positive impact we've seen as women business owners embrace digitalization is especially encouraging, and we hope to further enable that trend as our partnership moves forward. This program not only confirms early learnings about the potential for the digital economy to empower small business success, but it provides an evidence base for the opportunity we have in this moment to unlock the financial health of underserved people through digital tools and services.""In addition to addressing the digital transformation of micro and small business-focused financial service providers, the program provided support to fintechs serving micro and small businesses globally, offered COVID-19 resources to small businesses in the U.S., and conducted research on the micro and small business impacts of the pandemic. As restrictions on movement lifted, the program focused on long-term digital transformation strategies to connect underserved people to new economic opportunities.Experts from Accion, Mastercard, and financial institutions leading on digital transformation will discuss the report's findings, lessons learned, and best practices for the future at the Digital Transformation Forum in London on November 15, available by livestream here.###About AccionAccion is a global nonprofit committed to creating a financially inclusive world, with a pioneering legacy in microfinance and fintech impact investing.

However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times haven't been advantageous for Lockheed Martin as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Lockheed Martin.How Is Lockheed Martin's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Lockheed Martin's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, we see that there was hardly any earnings per share growth to speak of for the company over the past year. Fortunately, a few good years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by 5.7% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders probably wouldn't have been overly satisfied with the unstable medium-term growth rates.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 9.3% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.4% per year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Lockheed Martin is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.We've established that Lockheed Martin currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.It is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin that you need to take into consideration.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Lockheed Martin, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

The median cost for a one-bedroom apartment now sits at $3,060 — a figure that would consume 45% of a median worker’s salary, or afford about 340 servings of avocado toast.Renters have responded by hoping… even praying… for a real estate crash. Online searches for the term have quadruped in 2022, and even faith groups are stepping in to help. (Perhaps the Satanic Temple will be next?)Yet, the prospect of a housing crash has made things worse, not better, for homebuyers. Weakening prices, declining inventory and higher mortgage rates are now all saying the same thing:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvestors should wait until 2024 to buy a house.Housing Crash 2023: Careful What You Wish ForIn mid-October, I warned investors how wild housing prices had become. The median American home now costs around $450,000, up 60% in real terms since 2000. And 31% of women and 37% of men between ages 25 to 29 now live in multi-generational households… a phenomenon also known as “living with Mom and Dad.”These are the same types of observations that drive my quantitative stock-picking method. When current data gives a poor probability of future returns, it’s better to fold your hand than hope for the best.Since then, the probabilities have begun to play out as expected. Despite Boston’s surge in rental prices, the sale value of homes across the U.S is finally on the decline. Two weeks after my initial warning, real estate platform Knock reported that 98 of the top 100 U.S. real estate markets saw prices drop from their spring 2022 peaks. Knock expects that Austin, Texas will see a drop of 9.3% through 2023, while Las Vegas will experience an even larger fall of 14.2%. This is why I rely so heavily on my quantitative systems.These figures are compounded by mortgage leverage, a hidden source of home equity volatility. The average mortgage debt now stands at over $230,000, according to credit firm Experian, suggesting that homeowner equity has shriveled by 20% to 25% this year.Story continuesBut much like stock markets, real estate prices take time to reach fruition. Prices can overshoot for months, and then undershoot for even longer. During the 2008 financial crisis, investors needed to wait an additional two years for home prices to start recovering. And in 2022, they’re only now starting to react to rising mortgage rates. History suggests that home prices will continue weakening through 2023 before rebounding in 2024.Graph of Home prices vs vehicle prices as of 2022-11-01 Much of real estate’s pricing lag relates to home seller psychology.“The ‘downside stickiness’ of house prices is unique,” notes Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American. “In the housing market, sellers often withdraw supply rather than sell at lower prices.”Unlike equity investors, homeowners can live in their assets while waiting for better prices.Another factor is the relative illiquidity of the real estate market. The average home takes 100 days to sell, split between time spent for listing and closing. By the time a home’s final sale price is made public, several more months may have elapsed.But no matter the reason, one thing is clear:Home prices have further to fall in 2023.Insiders Are Foreshadowing Lower Home PricesNowhere is negative sentiment clearer than at America’s largest homebuilders, the bellwether of the residential real estate market. On Oct. 25, CEO Ryan Marshall of PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) warned of “softness” in homebuying demand.“The pullback in [Q3] demand was widespread across geographies and consumer groups as potential home buyers move to the sidelines,” Mr. Marshall noted. “Some because they can no longer afford a home and others because they were unsure if now [is] truly the best time to buy a home.”The company has responded by drastically cutting production targets for the remainder of the year. PulteGroup has already walked away from almost $800 million of future land acquisition spend, and reduced its guidance to closing 8,000 homes in Q4.These cutbacks are not enough. The average time that homes spend on markets has risen 60% since May and housing inventory levels are now as high as in September 2007.Graph of Months of Housing Supply as of Nov 2022The overoptimism will spill into oversupply. PulteGroup’s 8,000 expected home closings in Q4 marks a 13% increase over its Q3 figures — almost twice as high as its usual Q4 boost. Unsurprisingly, the largest U.S. homebuilders earn relatively poor scores on my Profit &amp; Protection scoring methodology, especially in the areas of growth and momentum.TickerCompany NameGrowth ScoreValue ScoreQuality ScoreMomentum ScoreTotal ScoreDHID R HortonCAA+BB+LENLennarCA+A+BB+PHMPulteGroupCA+A+BA-NVRNVRCBA+BB-TOLToll BrothersBA+ABB+Mortgage Rates Will Fall by 2024First-time homebuyers are also facing peak mortgage rates. On Oct. 26, average 30-year mortgage rates in the U.S. passed 7% for the first time since 2002. All else equal, the typical 3-bedroom homebuyer can now only afford a 2-bedroom in the same market. Put another way, a $500,000 mortgage now costs $3,509 per month, up from $2,068 last year.Graph of US mortgage rates as of Nov 2022The yield curve, however, suggests that these rates will fall by 2024. 1-year Treasurys now trade at over a 50-basis-point premium to 10-year bonds, compared to a more typical 150-basis-point discount. All else equal, credit markets are now forecasting anywhere from a 1% to 4% drop from current rates.Graph of Treasury yield curve vs 2021 as of 2022-11-01 treasury yield curve vs 2021As for refinancing, homebuyers are also better off waiting. Refinancing can cost up to 6% of the remaining principal of a loan, adding risk to buying an unaffordable home today with the hope of refinancing down the road.In other words, unless you’re a real estate investor looking to rent out properties for income, volatile mortgage rates are saying to rent a cheaper apartment now and consider going back into the market in 2024.Stocks vs. Real Estate: Why Investors Should Buy Stocks InsteadMeanwhile, prices of non-real-estate stocks are already bouncing back. Today, I released my list of 23 top penny stocks to buy. Unlike housing prices, penny stocks are early movers relative to Fed policy, rather than laggards. Some of my new picks are already up double-digits in the past month — and it’s not even Christmas yet.A similar move happened in March 2009, when stocks began to bottom out. It would take housing prices another two more years to begin their slow recovery, an eternity in the investment world. It’s why my quantitative Profit &amp; Protection system has begun to favor penny stocks instead of anything related to real estate.Consider Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR), one of the four firms that operate a global oligopoly of the Global Distribution System, a network of programs that control airline and hotel bookings. Shares of the Texas-based company have fallen from $15 in 2021 to under $6 today, placing it squarely in value territory.Yet, the firm has continued to earn a solid A+ for quality in my stock-picking system. Analysts expect that Sabre will generate $100 million in free cash flow by 2023 and for revenues to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2025.A similar story is brewing for companies like SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI), a firm that saw shares plummet 75% over the past year. Though the company isn’t as cheap — earning a B+ in that category — its bank-like status makes temporarily high rates a good thing for net interest income.I get it. Renting is awful right now. But the alternative of buying is far worse. You’ll either end up with an unaffordable home, or a cheap one that’s too small for your needs. Best to keep praying that the housing crash will soon end.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. As per Bank of America, a new bull market could emerge in 2023 after the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates in 2022 in a bid to control inflation. While most investors are focused on the Fed's continuous rate hikes, they fail to observe that the central bank is shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet by means of monthly roll-offs of its treasury and mortgage debt worth $95 billion. Paired with rising rates, this move will make the global market illiquid, which can trigger a reversal in the Fed’s policy making next year. BofA's investment strategist Michael Hartnett said that central banks are ""petrified of market consequences of liquidity withdrawal.” The US dollar climbing new highs is another signal that the Fed could potentially press pause on its fiscal tightening. Any shift from the Fed, whether it chooses to halt future interest rate hikes or continues its monthly balance sheet reductions, could be a positive indicator for investors and result in a significant rally. However, Hartnett observed that the market will experience more pain before a relief rally in 2023, and he expects that stocks will touch record lows soon. As stocks hurtle towards new lows, investors are taking this opportunity to pile into high-quality firms which would normally be trading at much higher multiples. Case in point, Hartnett observed on October 21 that equities experienced in flows of more than $9 billion in the past week. Some of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023 include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”10.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services for individual customers, small and mid-sized businesses, institutional investors, large enterprises, and governments worldwide. It is one of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to pick up for next year. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:10 Stocks That Will Make You RichGoldman Sachs Semiconductor StocksBest Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 13 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.38 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 87.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this discount optical retailer and eye care provider would post earnings of $0.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of 162.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.National Vision , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $499.21 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.13%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $518.01 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.National Vision shares have lost about 24.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.4%.What's Next for National Vision?While National Vision has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for National Vision: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

In fact, confusion about which plastics should be recycled is leading some to forgo it altogether – at a time when demand for recycled plastics has never been stronger.2022 Plastics Recycling Consumer SurveyAs major brands set ambitious targets for recycled content in their packaging and states adopt minimum recycled content standards the demand for high-quality recycled plastics will only grow – but the current supply of the right types of recycled plastics falls short. November 15 is America Recycles Day and to mark the day, Republic Services is sharing information to help address plastics recycling misconceptions and educate consumers on recycling best practices.""America Recycles Day is an opportunity for everyone to brush up on their knowledge of proper recycling,"" said Pete Keller, vice president of recycling and sustainability.

Core earnings of $1.67 per share rose 55% year over year on a reported basis and 70% at constant exchange rates (CER).Total revenues were $10.98 million, up 11% on a reported basis and 19% at CER in the quarter, driven by higher product sales. Revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Product Sales RiseProduct sales rose 16% at CER to $10.59 billion. Collaboration revenues were $392 million, almost tripling from the year-ago quarter levels.Among AstraZeneca’s various therapeutic areas, Oncology product sales were up 22%. CVRM product sales were up 19%, while the Respiratory &amp; Immunology segment gained 1%. Vaccines &amp; Immune Therapies sales declined 21%. Rare disease product sales were up 11%. Sales of other medicines rose 30%.Sales of Some Key DrugsIn Oncology, Lynparza product revenues rose 19% year over year to $659 million, owing to growth in use in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers in the United States as well as the launch in early breast cancer in the country in March. Increased use in first-line HRD-positive ovarian cancer and increased uptake for expanded label in breast cancer boosted sales in Europe.AstraZeneca markets Lynparza in partnership with Merck MRK. The profit-sharing deal between AstraZeneca and Merck was inked in 2017. In addition to Lynparza, the deal included Koselugo.AstraZeneca &amp; Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, namely ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indications as well as some other cancer types.Tagrisso recorded sales of $1.4 billion, up 20% year over year on strong demand as a first-line and adjuvant treatment. Increased use of Tagrisso for the first-line setting in China and continued growth in other Emerging Markets offset the negative impact of the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) price reduction in China.Story continuesImfinzi generated sales of $737 million in the quarter, up 26% year over year, driven by increased demand for ES-SCLC indication. AstraZeneca witnessed some recovery in lung cancer diagnosis rates, mainly in the United States and Europe.Calquence generated sales of $566 million in the quarter, up 63% year over year, benefiting from the increased new patient market share.Sales of AstraZeneca’s legacy cancer drugs, such as Iressa, Faslodex, Arimidex and Casodex declined during the quarter. However, sales of Zoladex rose in the quarter.In CVRM, Brilinta/Brilique sales were $338 million in the reported quarter, down 7% year over year, primarily due to the slower post-pandemic recovery of oral antiplatelet medicines like Brilinta in the United States and the EU and pricing pressure from the VBP (volume-based procurement) program in China.Farxiga recorded product sales of $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 50% year over year, reflecting volume growth across all regions and growth of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in general. The label expansion approvals for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease indications contributed to Farxiga’s sales growth in the United States and Europe. In Emerging markets, Farxiga is witnessing growth in ex-China Emerging Markets.In Respiratory &amp; Immunology, Symbicort sales declined 1% in the quarter to $630 million. Pulmicort sales declined 31% to $145 million.Fasenra recorded sales of $353 million in the quarter, up 15% year over year, driven by increased market share performance in Europe and the United States due to market leadership. However, sales are being hurt somewhat due to price erosion in Japan.AstraZeneca’s new triple combo COPD treatment Breztri recorded sales of $103 million in the quarter compared with $93 million in the previous quarter.New lupus drug, Saphnelo (anifrolumab) recorded sales of $33 million in the quarter, compared with $24 million in the previous quarter.In the Rare Disease portfolio, which was added following the Alexion acquisition in July 2021, Soliris recorded sales of $901 million, down 6% year over year due to conversion to Ultomiris. Ultomiris and Strensiq sales were $518 million and $237 million, up 47 and 20%, respectively.In Other Medicines, sales of Nexium rose 36% to $311 million.In Vaccines &amp; Immune Therapies, AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria, generated $173 million of revenues, much less than $451 million in the previous quarter due to the conclusion of many initial contracts. No revenues were recorded in the U.S. market in the second and third quarters of 2022.AZN’s COVID-19 antibody cocktail medicine Evusheld generated $537 million in sales, compared with $445 million in the previous quarter.Profit DiscussionAstraZeneca’s core gross margin of 80.8% was up 7 percentage points at CER as the dilutive effect from profit-sharing arrangements and increased pricing pressure in China was offset by a positive mix due to increased contribution from oncology and rare disease medicines. Core selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16% to $3.16 billion.Core research and development expenses rose 16% to $2.36 billion. Core operating profit rose 63% to $3.41 billion in the quarter. The core operating margin was 31.1% in the quarter, up 9% year over year.2022 GuidanceAstraZeneca expects total revenues to increase in the low twenties percentage in 2022, same as the previous expectations.Core earnings are expected to increase in the high twenties to low thirties percentage versus the previous expectation of the mid-to-high twenties percentage in 2022.Foreign exchange is expected to have a mid-single-digit percentage adverse impact on total revenues and a mid-to-high single-digit adverse impact on core EPS in 2022 (previously mid-single-digit).Our TakeAstraZeneca’s third-quarter results were encouraging as it beat estimates for earnings while sales came in line with the consensus mark. Product sales growth was driven by higher sales of key medicines across Oncology and CVRM units like Tagrisso and Farxiga, which offset lower sales of some key older medicines like Brilinta and Symbicort. Higher collaboration revenues also boosted the top line.AstraZeneca maintained its sales growth guidance for 2022 while raising its earnings growth expectations.AstraZeneca’s stock was up 3.9% in pre-market trading on Thursday in response to the better-than-expected results and earnings guidance raise.The stock has risen 4.9% this year so far compared with an increase of 4.2% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAstraZeneca is making rapid progress across its pipeline.

The stock rose 13%, resulting in a US$12b rise in the company's market capitalisation. In other words, the original US$5.3m purchase is now worth US$5.6m.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Boeing Boeing Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent purchase by David Calhoun is the biggest insider purchase of Boeing shares that we've seen in the last year. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$178 per share to be enticing. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.While Boeing insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Boeing Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Boeing. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$4.2m for shares in the company -- and none sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Insider Ownership Of BoeingLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.07% of Boeing shares, worth about US$74m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Boeing Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Boeing insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Boeing in 2017 identified that not all 737 MAX 8 aircraft were equipped with an AOA disagree alerts but did not directly notify FAA of the issue.An FAA spokesperson said the agency ""welcomes the outside scrutiny.""This will be the fourth review into the MAX by the OIG. In April 2021, the agency opened a review of the FAA's oversight of the Boeing 737 MAX return to service in late 2020.The new audit was prompted by a request in February by Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Peter DeFazio and Representative Rick Larsen, who oversees a key aviation subcommittee, after they asked what the FAA had done -- if anything -- to hold Boeing employees responsible for actions in connection with the MAX.DeFazio's committee in 2020 issued a report on the MAX crashes saying Boeing withheld ""crucial information from the FAA, its customers, and 737 MAX pilots,"" including ""concealing the very existence of MCAS from 737 MAX pilots.""MCAS, which was designed to help counter a tendency of the MAX to pitch up, could activate after data from only a single sensor.Boeing is seeking a waiver of a December deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for the MAX 7 and MAX 10. Only Congress can extend the certification deadline if the FAA does not certify the two MAX variants before the end of the year.Last month, a U.S judge in Texas ruled people killed in the two 737 MAX crashes are legally considered ""crime victims"" and is considering what remedies to impose. In December, some victims' relatives argued the department violated their rights when it struck a January 2021 $2.5 billion plea agreement with Boeing to resolve a criminal probe.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), Intuit Inc. (INTU) and Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Comcast have declined -41.5% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry’s decline of -44.4%. The company is facing slower broadband user base addition primarily due to reversal of pandemic trends and increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber are concerns.It is also persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is also a major concern. Nevertheless, Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Intuit have modestly underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-39.3% vs. -35.2%). The company is facing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds which might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.However, Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues.

141,ddc2252c-09b0-3afd-bd78-820623ceddda,NOC,2022-11-11,A Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) insider lowered their holding by 25% earlier this year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-corporation-nyse-noc-120051805.html,1668168051,STORY,['NOC'],"[Viewing insider transactions for Northrop Grumman Corporation's (NYSE:NOC ) over the last year, we see that insiders were net sellers. This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, David Perry, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$394 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$532, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of David Perry's holding. David Perry was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of Northrop GrummanLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Northrop Grumman insiders own about US$149m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Northrop Grumman Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Northrop Grumman insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Northrop Grumman insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Northrop Grumman and understanding these should be part of your investment process.But note: Northrop Grumman may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to see more of the cheapest stocks on Robinhood, go directly to 5 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood.Robinhood is a trading app famous for offering free trades on stocks as a business model. Instead of making money from commissions, Robinhood makes money from interest, margin lending, payment for order flow and more.As a result of saving people substantial amounts in commissions, Robinhood is one of the largest brokers in the world today with 12.2 million monthly active users and 22.9 million net funded accounts as of Q3 2022.Recently, Robinhood stocks launched an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. Although some stocks in the popular 100 are meme stocks, some could be considered cheap in the long term given their competitive advantages and high quality businesses.20222022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Given inflation is still high, many analysts think the U.S. central bank could raise rates further.If rates go up, aggregate demand could decrease and demand for individual companies could weaken in the near term. Although the market has already priced in some of the economic slowdown, there could still be downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood, we took some of the most popular stocks in Robinhood that trade below the analyst average price target. To filter out meme stocks, we ensured that each stock had competitive advantages and scale.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares on the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.Story continues12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood12. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares have fallen substantially since the beginning of the pandemic given the decline in air travel. Although the company could face near term headwinds given macro headwinds, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) still has long term earnings growth potential given its scale and competitive advantages. Analysts have an average price target of $187.12 versus the price of $168.74 as of 11/9.Alongside Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the cheapest stocks that's popular on Robinhood.11. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has fallen 21.7% year to date due to the broader market weakness and macro headwinds. Nevertheless, some analysts such as David Palmer of Evercore ISI are bullish. Palmer has a $97 price target and an 'Outperform' rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) given his estimate of the company earning $3.39 in FY23 EPS. In the long term, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has high quality earnings potential that could justify a potentially higher valuation.10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Although Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares are down nearly 21% year to date, the company is a leader in R&amp;D given its development of Paxlovid. With a substantial product pipeline, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has potential for EPS growth in the future even if Wall Street is expecting the company's earnings per share to decline by an average of 1.8% per year for the next 5 years. With a forward P/E of around 9, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) could be a cheap stock in the long term.9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Although NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares are down almost 45% year to date due to rising inventories and increasing costs, the company nevertheless has a very strong brand. If macroeconomic conditions normalize, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) may be able to adjust with potentially more sales.Leaven Partners commented on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year. Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Given near term headwinds, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has fallen 53% year to date. According to Rajvindra Gill of Needham's analysis, there could be weaker than expected demand for semiconductor stocks in general in the trough part of the industry cycle. The broader market has also been weak. Nevertheless, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could still be a long term growth stock if it can achieve its potential. Analysts have an average price target of $190.5 per share for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) .7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Although a recession would be a headwind for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the near term, Carleton English of Barron's believes Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) along with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo could handle one assuming that it's not severe. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s balance sheet is stronger than it was several years ago and the bank has substantial long term earnings power. Analysts have an average price target of $41.1 per share for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares fell 13.16% on Wednesday after the company missed on earnings and the company guided for slower than expected growth for next year. Nevertheless, some analysts are still bullish. Shortly after the earnings report, Philip Cusick of JPMorgan cut his price target to $135 from $145, but still retained an 'Overweight' rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Visa Inc.

If you want to see more cheap ESG stocks, go directly to 5 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now.ESG investing is investing in a way that considers environmental, social, and governance issues. The term is often interchangeably used with 'sustainable investing' or 'socially responsible investing'.In terms of the environmental issues, investors consider whether a company helps conserve and protect the natural environment. In terms of social issues, investors consider whether a company has good relationships with employees, customers, and communities. Finally in terms of the governance aspect, investors consider whether a company has standards for company leadership and offer risk controls.ESG investing is a big trend on Wall Street.According to PwC, ""Asset managers globally are expected to increase their ESG-related assets under management (AuM) to US$33.9tn by 2026, from US$18.4tn in 2021. With a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.9%, ESG assets are on pace to constitute 21.5% of total global AuM in less than 5 years.""2022Given investors focus on areas that don't necessarily generate the highest returns, ESG investing might not match the broader market return, especially if their fees are higher than the average.Nevertheless, there are some ESG stocks that trade for attractive valuations given the market decline in 2022.With the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts think the U.S. central bank will increase rates even further.As a result of the substantial interest rate increases, the broader market indexes have declined signficantly in 2022 and some stocks trade for relatively low valuations that make them cheap.If economic data doesn't meet expectations, there could still be more downside in the near to medium terms. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesSergey Nivens/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with a forward P/E of under 15 that were among Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)'s top 33 holdings as of 11/8/2022 in terms of % of the fund.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now10.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”6. Pfizer Inc.

149,47c434e4-e1c0-3194-9298-0d36eb164969,PFE,2022-11-11,Clovis (CLVS) Plummets on News of Possible Bankruptcy Filing,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clovis-clvs-plummets-news-possible-154603292.html,1668095163,STORY,"['SNDX', 'PFE']","[Shares of Clovis Oncology CLVS plunged 71.6% after the company announced that it will not have sufficient liquidity to maintain its operations beyond January 2023, based on current cash and cash equivalents, together with current estimates for revenues to be generated by sales of the cancer drug, Rubraca. This announcement overshadowed the company’s third-quarter results.Per management, a potential bankruptcy filing in the near term is quite plausible as the recent regulatory developments impacted current revenues and the commercial potential of Rubraca. The company is also facing continuing challenges in raising additional capital as a result of the uncertain market potential of Rubraca.Rubraca (rucaparib), an oral small molecule inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (“PARP”), is marketed in the United States for an indication specific to recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer and also for an indication specific to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”).Sales of this drug have been adversely impacted in the last two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on patient visits and diagnoses and stiff competition from other drugs in the market, including the impact on second-line maintenance that may result from an increase in first-line maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer (indications for which competing products are approved).The FDA and EMA are now focusing on the mature overall survival data for the drugs previously approved, based on achieving progression free survival (PFS) as a primary endpoint. This has led to withdrawals of certain later line indications in ovarian cancer for Rubraca and each of the other PARP inhibitors on the market with a later-line treatment indication in ovarian cancer.Clovis will need to raise additional capital in the near term in order to fund its operating plan and continue beyond January 2023.The company had indicated the same concurrent with the second-quarter results, leading to a decline in share price.Story continuesThe stock has lost 89.7% in the year compared with the industry’s 21.2% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 ResultsClovis reported a net loss of 39 cents per share for third-quarter 2022, narrower than the year-ago period’s loss of 56 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 42 cents.Net revenues — entirely from Clovis’ only marketed drug PARP inhibitor Rubraca — were down 19.1% year over year to $30.7 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35 million.Sales of Rubraca in the United States were $23 million, down 19.8% year over year. Ex-U.S. market sales were $7.6 million for the third quarter, compared with $9.2 million in the year-ago quarter.Research and development expenses decreased 33.3% year over year to $30.8 million, primarily owing to lower spending on Rubraca clinical studies.Selling, general and administrative expenses dropped 5.6% year over year to $30.4 million.Clovis ended the quarter with $58.3 million of cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities compared with $94.6 million on Jun 30, 2022.Clovis has a license agreement with Pfizer PFE to develop and commercialize Rubraca. The abovementioned condition forced Clovis to discuss with Pfizer, Inc. about deferring certain royalty payments due under its in-license agreement. The agreement is with respect to Rubraca sales during the third quarter of $4.3 million and the fourth quarter until Mar 31, 2023, plus interest thereon from the date such payments would otherwise be payable under the license agreement until actually paid.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderClovis currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A couple of better-ranked stocks in biotech include Syndax Pharmaceuticals SNDX and Puma Biotechnology PBYI. While Syndax sports a Zacks Rank #1, Puma carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past 60 days, loss estimates for Puma have narrowed to 6 cents from 16 cents. Puma also surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 201.37%.Over the past 60 days, loss estimates for Syndax have narrowed to $2.59 from $2.68.

The positive response could be attributed to the company’s comfortable earnings beat and its declaration of a dividend hike.What Did Marathon Petroleum’s Earnings Unveil?Marathon Petroleum reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.80 and compared with a profit of merely 73 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $4.6 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.2%.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.2 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.7 billion and improved 44.8% year over year.In October, the company completed its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp;i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion. Currently, MPC has remaining authorization of $5 billion with no expiration date.In more good news for investors, MPC’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 75 cents per share to its common shareholders of record on Nov 16. The payout, which represents a 30% sequential increase, will be made on Dec 12.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $4.6 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $509 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and throughputs.Specifically, the refining margin of $30.21 per barrel improved significantly from $14.51 a year ago. Total refined product sales volumes were 3,587 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from 3,539 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput rose from 2,836 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 3,007 mbpd and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,932 mbpd. Capacity utilization during the quarter was up from last year’s 93% to 98%.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, 12.9% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. Earnings were supported by stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetMarathon Petroleum, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported expenses of $40.6 billion in third-quarter 2022, rising 29.7% from the year-ago quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $789 million on capital programs (56% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 34% on the Midstream segment) compared to $464 million in the year-ago period. As of Sep 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 44.9%.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MPC’s third-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.46, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.98. The bottom line also more than doubled from a profit of $3.18 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins surged to $26.58 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $8.57. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $38.76 and $19.22 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $12.47 and $9.27, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, Phillips 66 saw the metric jump to $21.29 per barrel from $5.75 in the prior-year quarter. The West Coast witnessed an increase in margins from $7.46 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $28.64 in the September-end quarter of 2022.Another refining giant Valero Energy VLO reported adjusted earnings of $7.14 per share compared to a meager $1.22 in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7 per share. VLO’s strong quarterly results were supported by increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin.For the quarter, Valero’s refining throughput volumes were 3,005 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d), up from 2,864 MBbls/d in third-quarter 2021. Meanwhile, VLO’s refining margin per barrel of throughput increased to $21.34 from the year-ago level of $10.07.Then we have Murphy USA MUSA, whose third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $9.28 handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 and improved significantly from the year-earlier bottom line of $3.98. MUSA’s outperformance could be attributed to a rise in the retail gasoline price and a higher retail margin of 37.6 cents per gallon, up 41.4% year over year.Merchandise sales, at $1 billion, rose 7.7% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $983 million. However, Murphy USA’s revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $5.1 billion, falling 3.7% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but up 42.1% from the third quarter of 2021.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Under the 17-year agreement, AES Andes will provide 1,069 Gigawatt hours per year (""GWh/year"") of energy from renewable sources, building on the February 2020 QB2 renewable energy announcement to achieve 100% clean, renewable energy for QB2 starting in 2025.AES Andes uses its growing renewable portfolio that includes wind, solar, hydro and battery plants to supply clean energy to QB2.The use of 100% renewable energy for QB2 instead of energy from coal-fired generation will avoid a total of approximately 1.6 million tonnes of annual greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions, equivalent to removing over 340,000 combustion engine passenger vehicles from the road – more than the annual emissions of all the cars in the City of Vancouver or two and a half times the numbers of cars in the Tarapacá Region of Chile where QB2 is located.“Securing 100% renewable power for our QB2 copper operation is a significant step forward in Teck’s ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our business and support global action on climate change,” said Jonathan Price, CEO of Teck. “Reaching full renewable power for QB2 will enable us to achieve our goal of net-zero scope 2 emissions by 2025 as we harness clean power to minimize the GHG footprint of our operations.”The CEO of AES Andes, Javier Dib, stated: ""We are very honoured and grateful for the trust that Teck has once again placed in AES Andes as a provider of innovative and intelligent power solutions. The long-term renewable agreements we are signing through the Coal to Green solution allow us to make our strategic customers' operations more sustainable and competitive and to accompany them in their transition to emission-free energy. We are convinced that by working together we are accelerating the future of energy and advancing in the sustainable energy transition that Chile is carrying out"".Story continuesThis agreement will enable Teck to achieve its goal of net-zero scope 2 emissions (emissions associated with purchased power) by 2025, which would make it one of the first companies in the mining industry to achieve this target. It also contributes to Teck’s 2030 goal of reducing carbon intensity of operations by 33% and ultimately becoming a net-zero operator by 2050. Teck previously announced switching to 100% renewable power for its Carmen de Andacollo Operation in Chile.

For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAGY).

(NYSE:PNC) insiders, selling US$3.4m worth of stock earlier this year was a smart move.",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pnc-financial-services-group-inc-130009859.html,1668171609,STORY,['PNC'],"[Last week, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:PNC) stock jumped 6.9%, but insiders who sold US$3.4m worth of stock in over the past year are likely to be in a better position. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$187, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$164. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At PNC Financial Services Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. In total, Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking Michael Lyons sold US$584k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$230m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But since PNC Financial Services Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of PNC Financial Services Group.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

TGT’s third quarter report will also give further insight into consumer spending amid an economic downturn.The Basics Target stock has been hit harder than competitor Walmart WMT, which is also set to report next week. Target struggled during the second quarter due to excess inventory amid slower consumer spending and rising inflation. Profits in Q2 fell by more than 90% as the company was forced to sell the excess inventory at steep discounts.Like Walmart, Target has evolved into more than just a brick &amp; mortar retailer. Target has strived for technological advancements across its website and mobile apps to compete with e-commerce companies such as Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY.The company also sells merchandise through periodic exclusive design, creative partnerships, and shop-in-shop experiences, with partners such as Apple AAPL, Disney DIS, Levi's LEVI, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. Target also generates revenue from in-store amenities such as Target Café, Starbucks SBUX, and Target Optical, becoming a one-stop shop for consumers.Investors hope that the decline in TGT stock over the last year will turn out to be a long-term buying opportunity. This makes the company’s Q3 report and outlook critical for the stock as Target has now missed earnings expectations for two consecutive quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Outlook  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TGT’s Q3 earnings is $2.14 per share, which would be a decline of -29% from the year prior quarter. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 3% at $26.36 billion. This is an indication that operating costs are weighing on Target’s profits although the company says inventory issues are behind it.Earnings estimates for the period are down from $2.42 at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, TGT earnings are expected to decline -40% to $8.09 per share. However, fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to stabilize and rise 49% to $12.11 per share.Story continuesTop line growth is expected, with sales set to rise 3% in fiscal 2023 and another 3% in FY24 to $113.78 billion.

175,3f4e98b1-8624-3be3-90f7-d44e65c0b670,TGT,2022-11-11,Ross Stores (ROST) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ross-stores-rost-expected-beat-150003612.html,1668092403,STORY,"['ROST', 'TGT']","[The market expects Ross Stores (ROST) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -26.6%.Revenues are expected to be $4.36 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.45% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores?For Ross Stores, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.13%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.11, delivering a surprise of +13.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ross Stores appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, Target (TGT) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share for the quarter ended October 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -29.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $26.36 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Target has been revised 0.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.34%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Target will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

176,a2cea593-b07c-37d7-9117-f57077cf0392,TGT,2022-11-11,Target Corporation (TGT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-tgt-attracting-investor-140002241.html,1668088802,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target (TGT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -0.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has gained 4.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.09 points to a change of -40.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.11 indicates a change of +49.7% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Target.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $26.36 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $109.79 billion and $113.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.6% and +3.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $0.39 for the same period compares with $3.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.47%. The EPS surprise was -45.07%.Over the last four quarters, Target surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BXP recently announced that it has disposed of The Avant at Reston Town Center in Reston, VA. This move comes as part of the company’s capital-reallocation strategy focused on expanding into the growing Seattle market.Reflecting positive sentiments, shares of BXP gained 6.69% on Nov 10 normal trading session on the NYSE.The 15-story, 359-unit luxury residential property was sold for a gross sales price of $141 million. The transaction generated net proceeds of nearly $138 million for BXP.Boston Properties, which developed the property in 2013, will continue to own and manage the retail portion of it, which encompasses around 26,000 square feet. This includes several restaurants and a pharmacy as part of the vibrant urban core of Reston Town Center.Per Richard Ellis, senior vice president, residential of BXP, “The disposition of The Avant demonstrates the value creation contributed by BXP’s residential platform.”Boston Properties’ sale of the luxury residential property was carried out as the final part of a reverse like kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code with its acquisition of Madison Center in Seattle, WA, in May 2022. The Seattle market has experienced substantial growth in jobs from the technology and life sciences sectors in recent years and emerged as one of the top tech markets for employers and employees. Further, it offers a strong potential for companies in the technology, life sciences, financial services and manufacturing sectors. Hence, Boston Properties’ expansion in the Seattle market seems prudent.Moreover, BXP anticipates deferring the recognition of taxable gains from the sale for federal income tax purposes.To complete the exchange in connection with the $730 million acquisition of Madison Centre — a 755,000 square feet, 37-story, LEED-Platinum certified, Class A office property — BXP closed the disposition of three assets for a gross sale price of nearly $700 million. These were 601 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, DC, The Avant and two land parcels in Dulles, VA.Such efforts highlight Boston Properties' prudent capital-management practices and release the pressure on its balance sheet.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BXP’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates moving northward over the past two months.Its shares have lost 16.2% in the past three months compared with its industry's decline of 19.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Equity Commonwealth EQC, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

If you want to skip our comprehensive analysis, you can see the 5 best railroad stocks here.Railroad stocks fueled one of the earliest major investment booms in American history. Railroads are still an important aspect of the economy more than a century later. Over time, the sector has concentrated into a few titans responsible for carrying the majority of products across the country and to and from ports. Railroads fared better than other shippers and truckers during the COVID-19 epidemic due to their unique 24/7 business model and capacity to carry a large amount of freight with a small number of workers. And, in an age when fuel efficiency is increasingly important, trains are becoming the preferred mode of transportation.Since rail businesses are bigger and more capitalized than trucking companies, they do better in economic downturns than the majority of other transportation equities do. Railroads often do well during periods of high fuel prices since trains can move far more goods than vehicles for every gallon of diesel burnt, despite the fact that high oil prices result in greater fuel expenses.The railroad industry is expected to expand rapidly in the next years. According to Technavio's research analysis, the railroad industry is predicted to increase by $337 billion between 2020 and 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.14%.Some of the most notable railroad stocks in our list are CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), GATX Corporation (NYSE:GATX), and USD Partners LP (NYSE:USDP). best railroad stocks to buyankush-minda-7KKQG0eB_TI-unsplashMethodologyIn order to identify the best railroad stocks to buy we selected railroad stocks that have long-term growth catalysts and strong offerings.

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB) manufactures and sells technology-based equipment, systems, and services to the global freight rail and passenger transit sectors. It is divided into two segments: Freight and Transit. Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB) on October 21 declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, in line with previous. Payable on November 28 to shareholders of record as of November 14. Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB) currently has a dividend yield of 0.68% as of October 25.On September 20, Wabtec (NYSE:WAB) announced the signing of a $600 million memorandum of agreement with Kazakhstan Temir Zholy for 150 FLXdriveTM battery-electric shunters and modernization work to convert the mainline fleet into NextFuelTM liquid natural gas-powered (LNG) locomotives. The battery-powered FLXdrive shunters will allow the railroad to save $75,000 per shunter per year on fuel costs while lowering scheduled maintenance by up to 97%.Analyst Felix Boeschen of Raymond James on August 18 began coverage on Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB) with an Outperform rating and a $103 price target. According to the analyst, the company's ""multi-year growth algorithm"" is undervalued due to growing secular tailwinds such as ""considerable runway"" for locomotive fleet renewal needs and global decarbonization advantages.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 funds were bullish on Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB) as of Q2, in line with the previous quarter. Joseph Sirdevan's Galibier Capital Management is the only stakeholder of the company as of Q3 with 16,850 shares worth $1.37 million.Just like CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), GATX Corporation (NYSE:GATX), and USD Partners LP (NYSE:USDP), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation (NYSE:WAB) is also one of the most famous railroad stocks.Here is what TGV Intrinsic Fund has to say about Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“The second change concerns the American railway supplier Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (Wabtec). Wabtec took over the railway division from General Electric (GE) in 2019. As part of this, Rafael Santana – who had come over from GE – became the new CEO of Wabtec. The previous CEO, Ray Betler, is one of the best corporate leaders I know, and I particularly appreciated the decentralised corporate culture he embodied. The operating figures have developed nicely since 2019 under Rafael Santana. However, from conversations with current and former employees of Wabtec, it is becoming increasingly clear to me that the GE culture, which is designed to achieve short-term corporate goals, is establishing itself within the company. This culture is not necessarily bad – but it is a culture that does not fit the long-term orientation of the TGV Intrinsic.Accordingly, I recommended the sale of all Wabtec shares despite the decent operational development. Wabtec is a good example of a distinction between “process” and “result”. In the long run, the right process typically leads to a good result and the wrong process to a bad one. In the short term, however, even a wrong process can lead to a good result. Considered by itself, Wabtec’s financial development since 2019 (result) is not sufficient to make an investment recommendation for the future. Changes in the corporate culture (process) often only become noticeable in the financial figures after several years and are therefore a more meaningful indicator of the long-term operational development than the short-term historical busines development. Accordingly, my discussions with current and former Wabtec employees about changes in the corporate culture are the crucial reason for the sell recommendation, as I assume that the GE culture will lead to worse operating results in the long term.”9.

Railcar manufacturing is a capital intensive industry with low margins and an emphasis on reliable and scalable manufacturing. During Covid and the ensuing supply chain crises, the country’s railroads suffered as service levels dropped and the unanticipated demand for goods moved many loads to truck and air. With higher energy costs, railroad workers returning to work, manufacturing slowly returning to the US, and shippers seeking to reduce their cost burden by shipping on the cheapest mode of transportation, more loads are moving to rail. The railroad industry generally needs to replace ~35,000 railroad cars a year to maintain service level and has tracked materially below that for the last several years. With potential for further revenue growth, margin growth, and higher interest rates benefitting a growing leasing business while also limiting new competitors to their manufacturing business, GBX is priced to do well in this new environment.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Railroad Stocks to Invest In. Suggested articles:Top 10 Leisure Companies in the WorldBest Bitcoin Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Technology Dividend Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 10 Best Railroad Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Ross Stores has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Costco has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ROST has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ROST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.85, while COST has a forward P/E of 33.90. We also note that ROST has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. COST currently has a PEG ratio of 3.31.Another notable valuation metric for ROST is its P/B ratio of 7.68. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, COST has a P/B of 10.50.These metrics, and several others, help ROST earn a Value grade of B, while COST has been given a Value grade of C.ROST sticks out from COST in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ROST is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

186,3f4e98b1-8624-3be3-90f7-d44e65c0b670,ROST,2022-11-11,Ross Stores (ROST) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ross-stores-rost-expected-beat-150003612.html,1668092403,STORY,"['ROST', 'TGT']","[The market expects Ross Stores (ROST) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -26.6%.Revenues are expected to be $4.36 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.45% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores?For Ross Stores, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.13%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.11, delivering a surprise of +13.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ross Stores appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, Target (TGT) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share for the quarter ended October 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -29.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $26.36 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Target has been revised 0.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.34%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Target will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ADI) stock at high prices would have gotten insiders a handsome reward",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-3-2m-worth-110057473.html,1668164457,STORY,['ADI'],"[Analog Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ADI) stock rose 16% last week, but insiders who sold US$3.2m worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Selling at an average price of US$165, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices Analog Devices Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.3m worth of shares at a price of US$166 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$160. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Analog Devices didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Analog Devices better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Analog Devices Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Analog Devices. In total, Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology Vivek Jain dumped US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Analog Devices Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Analog Devices insiders own about US$279m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Analog Devices Tell Us?An insider sold Analog Devices shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Analog Devices. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Analog Devices and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221110005298/en/Regions Bank operates more than 2,000 ATMs across the Southeast, Midwest and Texas. (Photo: Business Wire)The result is greater financial inclusion. By working together, Regions, CDFIs and MDIs are expanding no-cost access to financial services through the Regions ATM network. Specifically, the agreement covers customers of the following institutions:Carver State Bank, a CDFI and MDI in Savannah, GeorgiaCitizens Savings Bank &amp; Trust, a CDFI and MDI in Nashville, TennesseeCommonwealth National Bank, a CDFI and MDI in Mobile, AlabamaFriend Bank, a CDFI in Dothan, AlabamaHope Community Credit Union, a CDFI in Jackson, MississippiOptus Bank, a CDFI and MDI in Columbia, South CarolinaSouthern Bancorp, a CDFI in Arkadelphia, Arkansas""Regions Bank is committed to creating more inclusive prosperity, and this collaboration is a key component of our broader, long-term work with CDFIs and MDIs to expand access to essential financial services,"" said John Turner, President and CEO of Regions Financial Corp. ""This new collaboration will benefit individual consumers in several states. Regions Bank and the Regions Community Development Corporation have also worked closely with CDFIs and MDIs in the past to support business activity in underserved communities, including a series of equity investments. These initiatives illustrate Regions’ dedication to not only providing financial services, but also uplifting communities across our footprint.""Story continuesCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are private financial institutions that are 100% dedicated to delivering responsible, affordable lending to help low-income, low-wealth, and other disadvantaged people and communities join the economic mainstream.Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) may be a federally insured depository institution of which 51% or more of the voting stock is owned by minority individuals – or a financial institution that primarily serves minority communities and whose board of directors is primarily composed of individuals from minority backgrounds.CDFIs and MDIs are often based in small towns, rural areas or urban communities and provide services in areas considered to be ‘bank deserts’ – where the nearest physical bank branch may be several miles away.""Equitable access to banking is one of the most impactful ways we can eliminate financial barriers and reduce the wealth gap in America,"" said Darrin Williams, CEO of Southern Bancorp. ""Our institution serves communities in the Mid-South that may not have convenient ways to make withdrawals or even check their balances. This partnership with Regions not only makes banking more accessible for our customers, but it will also help support our communities and, ultimately, our local economies.""The ATM arrangement follows a gathering hosted in June by Regions’ head of Community Affairs, Leroy Abrahams, and Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for the bank. Abrahams and Boyen met with executives from CDFIs and MDIs for an information-sharing session and to brainstorm ways the organizations can collaborate to better support local communities, especially underserved populations.Earlier this year, the Regions Community Development Corporation announced three equity-focused deals with CDFIs and MDIs, including two CDFIs that are included in the current ATM arrangement, Southern Bancorp and Carver Financial.""CDFIs and MDIs serve a vital role in ensuring equitable access to the financial system,"" Abrahams said. ""Regions shares many common objectives with these mission-based organizations, and by working more closely together, we are better able to provide banking access, which creates more equitable opportunities for people, businesses and communities.""About Regions Financial CorporationRegions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), with $158 billion in assets, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index and is one of the nation’s largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage products and services.

Inflation remains stubbornly high, hitting 8.2% in the month of September, with inflation now having officially soared to levels we haven’t seen in four decades. Thus, even for long-term investors in no-brainer stocks, it’s a difficult time to hold steady right now.With the Federal Reserve appearing intent on raising rates further from here, this is certainly true. That said, there is some good news. The U.S. central bank has signaled smaller increases are likely to materialize moving forward. This may help offset concerns that higher terminal rates than initially suggested are now a distinct possibility. The inflation fight appears to be far from over. Accordingly, investors, consumers, and all Americans should understand that the chances of something breaking in the economy are increasing. Indeed, many experts now suggest the chances of a recession in 2023 are higher than ever. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis dour outlook could continue to drive stocks lower next year. That said, there are plenty of no-brainer stocks investors may want to consider for 2023 and beyond. AAPLApple$138.96ASMLASML Holding$483.38VVisa$200.10UNHUnitedHealth Group$545.40MSFTMicrosoft$227.87DPZDomino’s Pizza$347.61ORLYO’Reilly Automotive$830.20Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comIt’s fair to assert that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is the best of the big tech giants to invest in. That has been true in 2022, as shares have outperformed its famed FAANG peer group it is often compared against. That said, Apple is down 23% year-to-date. This decline is meaningful, but it’s worth noting that this loss greatly outperforms that of the Nasdaq, which has fallen 33%. That matters, because the tech-heavy index is seen as a bellwether for how the broader technology sector is performing. Thus, it’s fair to argue that Apple is the best tech stock available, so for those who believe the sector will rebound, it may make sense to buy now. Story continuesApple has proven over its long history that it can better weather tech slowdowns when they arise. Thus, many investors look at Apple as a relatively defensive option, compared to its peers. The company’s dividend is another attribute which prompts such discussion. While Apple’s dividend only pays a modest 23 cents, yielding 0.7%, that’s still a 0.7% buffer against losses investors won’t have with most other tech shares. If not looked at as a buffer, it’s certainly a dependable income stream. Apple posted yet another record quarter. The naysayers continue to provide a negative outlook ,just as they have throughout this year. That said, I think now is the time to take advantage of the illogical sentiment that has pushed AAPL stock lower again. It will pay off. ASML Holding (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is a semiconductor firm that has fallen precipitously throughout 2022. This company has been plagued by the same doubts that have followed chip companies everywhere. Namely, persistent inflation and slowing global growth imply a slowdown in chip sales. By extension, that means the large, expensive lithography machines ASML produces should see waning demand as well. Thus, its share price should drop. Here’s the thing – the company’s share price has dropped, but its Q3 earnings report shows that demand remains quite strong. The company announced it sold 80 advanced lithography systems in Q3, which represented a decline of 3 machines on a year-over-year basis. In terms of used machines, 6 systems were sold compared to 8 one year prior. Thus, demand is essentially the same. Additionally, rising prices led to a marginal sales increase of 6%, with revenue reaching EUR 5.778 billion.  ASML is a highly-profitable company that provides a product few others can. In other words, it has a moat that is somewhat unassailable. That said, many investors are afraid to buy this no-brainer stock. Those that do should see strong upside realized over the long-term, while receiving a modest dividend to boot. Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) stock has a lot going for it. The company has posted four straight quarterly earnings beats over the past year, the most recent of which came a few weeks ago. The credit card giant’s revenues were up 19% year-over-year, reaching $7.8 billion. That figure was ahead of the $7.5 billion Wall Street was anticipating. Strong sales translated to earnings per share of $1.93, also above the Street’s projections. It hasn’t much mattered. Visa’s stock price continues to be punished, and has recently fallen below the $200 threshold as recession fears mount. Therein lies another tailwind for Visa. Boston Fed reserve research shows that in the Great Recession of ‘08-’09, reliance on credit cards increased as uncertainty grew. The job market remains tight right now, but it’s fair to say that recession fears are as strong as ever. Influential figures are increasingly calling for a recession in 2023. That could actually provide a boon for Visa, should historical patterns play out as expected. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is one of a select group of stocks that are likely to be recommended, no matter the prevailing economy. As its name suggests, UnitedHealth is a leading healthcare stock, meaning it belongs to a sector with relatively inelastic demand. People need access to doctors and medical care, recession or not. The firm’s recent Q3 earnings showed that to be true, with the company’s revenues climbing 12%. That led the company’s CEO Andrew Witty to reiterate previous 2022 projection, and suggest that earnings near the top end of its initial earnings outlook range were likely. Looking further out, UnitedHealth expects earnings growth in the range of 13-16% annually. Thus, UnitedHealth tends to fare in any macro environment, mostly because its industry is relatively predictable. But it’s also a stock that includes a dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1990. That’s another form of security that investors can rely on from UnitedHealth. All in all, these factors make UNH stock the type of equity that is perfect for the investor with a long-term horizon. Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock looks like a pretty safe bet right now. That might seem like a strange statement, given that MSFT stock continues to fall and is approaching its 52-week low. However, I tend to zoom out and take a more holsitic view of Microsoft in this market. Prior to the pandemic, MSFT stock traded around the $185 level. While the stock is nearing this mark, it still remains above pre-pandemic levels. That said, growth has surged (in part as a result of the pandemic), making the company’s valuation multiple more attractive right now.It’s certainly possible MSFT stock could fall further, but I don’t see it. One of the reasons why is the company’s stronger-than anticipated results for its third quarter. Microsoft’s Azure cloud results were slightly weaker than expected, but the overall numbers came in strong. Weaker-than-expected guidance led to a dropping Microsoft’s stock price, but I think investors are being too near-sighted on this company. Microsoft projects it will record between $52.4 and $53.4 billion in revenues next quarter. The company posted $51.73 billion in 2021 during the same period and $43 billion in 2020 (certainly, 2021 was an aberration in many senses). Microsoft will be fine, just as long as investors don’t expect it to grow like it did between 2020 and 2021 indefinitely. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comDomino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)  will contend with many of the same issues facing all retail operators across the economy into 2023. That means the company’s costs are likely to continue to run higher, negatively impacting its bottom line. For investors who look past those uncontrollable factors, what emerges is a strong opportunity. Domino’s Pizza saw its net income slip in the most recent quarter. Net income fell to $100.5 million in Q3 from $120.4 million a year earlier. That’s rarely a positive sign. However, Domino’s did see supply chain costs increase by more than $62 million in the quarter. So, a $20 million decrease in the bottom line isn’t as bad as it could have been. This strongly implies that Domino’s management team is steering the company through a rough period well, via passing on costs to consumers. Zooming out, it also appears that the broader picture of demand for Domino’s remains high. Sales increased by $70 million this past quarter, reaching $1.068 billion.Should we be headed into a recession in 2023, I think Domino’s will perform well, for obvious reasons. This is a company that sells cheap pizza, replace more expensive out-of-home meal alternatives. For those looking to eat out on a budget, this company will likely be the way to go.O’Reilly (ORLY)The front of an O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) store.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comO’Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) stock is on of the best options for investor stocks consider as we head into 2023. The auto parts retailer had a strong 2022, partly driven by wild swings in the car market, and in particular, surging demand for used cars. Semiconductor shortages meant fewer new cars were built, which sent buyers searching for used alternatives. That dynamic has cooled, and used car prices are starting to break. That is probably a strong sign for O’Reilly moving forward. Demand for used cars is likely to increase the worse the economy gets. And in a recession, most consumers are less-likely to have the money for a new car purchase. Accordingly, with older cars requiring more maintenance, there are clear tailwinds building for O’Reilly. Additionally, a recession is likely to lead consumers to hold on to their vehicles for longer. Thus, more demand for vehicle parts in times of distress could be the boon investors in ORLY stock are looking for. The good news is that most investors aren’t fully sold on ORLY stock, compared to competitors like AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). Upside remains baked into O’Reilly’s target stock price, whereas AutoZone is trading above its consensus target price. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We believe firmly that there is importance and significance in representation.”ABC 57 reported that the company has been a part of Project Impact, an initiative in South Bend providing resources to support minority-owned businesses. Luten said he depends on such support to help the company reach its goals, which include scaling up to a new 4,200-square-foot facility.“We want to be able to open and expand more opportunity to our communities and to engage minority entrepreneurs and expand the opportunity,” said James Summers a volunteer executive director of Project Impact.“Our entire goal behind Importin’ Joe’s is to change the trajectory of children who are at risk and children who are homeless so our goal is to cultivate a community that can eventually accommodate 15,000 or more from children and women in Ethiopia, while simultaneously equipping our current ecosystem in our community here as well,” said Luten.Future plans for the company include supporting the local community, giving back to their roots, and working to expand to more than 60 locations across Indiana and Southwest Michigan by the spring.]"

If you want to see more cheap ESG stocks, go directly to 5 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now.ESG investing is investing in a way that considers environmental, social, and governance issues. The term is often interchangeably used with 'sustainable investing' or 'socially responsible investing'.In terms of the environmental issues, investors consider whether a company helps conserve and protect the natural environment. In terms of social issues, investors consider whether a company has good relationships with employees, customers, and communities. Finally in terms of the governance aspect, investors consider whether a company has standards for company leadership and offer risk controls.ESG investing is a big trend on Wall Street.According to PwC, ""Asset managers globally are expected to increase their ESG-related assets under management (AuM) to US$33.9tn by 2026, from US$18.4tn in 2021. With a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.9%, ESG assets are on pace to constitute 21.5% of total global AuM in less than 5 years.""2022Given investors focus on areas that don't necessarily generate the highest returns, ESG investing might not match the broader market return, especially if their fees are higher than the average.Nevertheless, there are some ESG stocks that trade for attractive valuations given the market decline in 2022.With the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts think the U.S. central bank will increase rates even further.As a result of the substantial interest rate increases, the broader market indexes have declined signficantly in 2022 and some stocks trade for relatively low valuations that make them cheap.If economic data doesn't meet expectations, there could still be more downside in the near to medium terms. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesSergey Nivens/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with a forward P/E of under 15 that were among Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)'s top 33 holdings as of 11/8/2022 in terms of % of the fund.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now10.

The sales growth was primarily driven by the company’s international business, which rose over 5%, delivering 11% growth versus prior year.More from Footwear NewsEarnings Wrap: Tapestry, Ralph Lauren and Dillard's Report Latest Results + MoreWolverine Stock Slides as Company Misses Revenue and Profit Targets in Q3Adidas Cuts Guidance as It Grapples With Losing Yeezy BusinessIn Europe, sales increased 24%, fueled by higher international tourist traffic, notably from the Middle East and within Europe, as well as continued growth with local customers. For Greater China, sales declined 11% due to COVID related headwinds. The APAC region rose 9% versus prior year despite COVID-related headwinds in Greater China. Sales in North America rose slightly over last year, with low single-digit gains in the region’s direct business.By brand, revenues at Coach were flat compared to the same time last year at $1.12 billion. On the company earnings call on Thursday, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat highlighted its core leather goods offering as what drove the heritage brand’s business this quarter. In footwear, strong revenue gains were fueled by new styles, including the Leah Loafer and the Lucy Sandal, as well as continued momentum in the men’s Lowline Sneaker, Crevoiserat noted.At Kate Spade, revenues were up 7% in Q1 to $321.9 million versus $299.5 million the same period in 2021. The CEO said this brand’s Knott collection of bags continues to be number one. The company also saw a strong foundation of Kate Spade’s lifestyle positioning and delivered high single-digit growth across ready-to-wear footwear and jewelry.At Stuart Weitzman, however, the footwear brand saw a 2% loss in the quarter, reporting revenues of $65.3 million, down from $66.5 million the same time last year. According to Crevoiserat, the brand saw growth in North America, aided by strength in the wholesale channel, while pressure remained in the highly penetrated Greater China region given COVID headwind. The CEO pointed out the brand’s Stuart family of products, which was launched earlier in the calendar year, as quickly becoming a staple within Stuart Weitzman’s offering. “This collection of pumps and boots drove 15% of sales and was a favorite among both new and existing customers,” she said. “At the same time, the recently introduced Soho Loafer delivers outsized growth.”Story continuesAs of 2 p.m., shares for Tapestry were up almost 1%.Looking ahead, Crevoiserat told investors on today’s call that the company is “well positioned” for holiday, despite revising its fiscal year 2023 outlook. “Our outlook reflects realistic expectations given the macro uncertainty,” she said. “Our eyes are wide open, and we have a prudent plan, and we’ll manage our business prioritizing long-term brand health.”The company now expects revenue for the full year of between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, versus its previous guidance of $6.9 billion for fiscal 2023. This new expectation represents a slight decline versus prior year on a reported basis due entirely to approximately 450 basis points based on incremental currency pressure resulting from the further strengthening of the U.S. Dollar.“Moving forward, although the environment is uncertain, our foundation is strong and the clarity of our vision is unchanged,” Crevoiserat added. “We will continue to be disciplined in advancing our strategic objectives through an unwavering focus on the consumer and a commitment to innovation.”These results come two months after the company outlined a new three-year growth strategy at its 2022 Investor Day. Among the new goals includes new financial targets for the years ahead. The company now expects to achieve revenue of $8 billion by fiscal year 2025, reflecting a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% to 7%.]"

The metric increased 8% from $1.20 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly net sales increased 7% to $280 million compared with $263 million reported in the year-ago quarter.In an earlier press release, management highlighted that third-quarter net sales rose 12% at comparable foreign currency rates.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Inter Parfums, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseInter Parfums, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Inter Parfums, Inc. Quote In the company’s U.S. operations, new brands like Ferragamo, Donna Karan and DKNY generated 41% of the gains. Apart from this, organic growth from established brands like GUESS?, Oscar de la Renta, Hollister, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also contributed to the upside.Management highlighted that sales of its European operations increased 12% in euro, with the three largest brands Montblanc, Jimmy Choo and Coach, outperforming by 11%, 32% and 3% year over year, respectively. Several mid-sized brands, namely Kate Spade, Rochas, Boucheron, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Karl Lagerfeld also witnessed comparable quarter sales growth. That being said, a 17% decline in the average euro-to-dollar exchange rate masked such an upside resulting in a 4% drop in the quarterly European-based product sales in dollars.Inter Parfums stated that it witnessed modest growth in the third quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. The company continued to face some supply chain-related issues, which pushed the delivery of some holiday gift sets into the next quarter. That said, the company’s Italian operations are running, with Ferragamo on track to become the second-largest brand under the U.S. operations banner during the year. Inter Parfums continues to see solid momentum in its travel retail business. The company’s travel amenities operation has started to experience growth.Inter Parfums’ third-quarter gross profit margin was 64.9%, up 120 basis points from 63.7% reported in the year-ago quarter. For European-based operations, the gross profit margin was 69.5%, up from 66.6% posted in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar during 2022 and a favorable impact from mix and pricing actions. However, higher transportation and component costs were a concern for the metric. For U.S. operations, the gross margin stood at 53.8%, up from 53.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. Gains from scale, pricing actions and favorable brand and giftset mix contributed to the upside.SG&amp;A expenses amounted to $117.4 million, up from $99.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. For European operations, SG&amp;A expenses increased to 42.1% of net sales from 38.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. The rise in such costs can largely be attributed to a return to promotional and advertising levels commensurate with sales. For U.S. operations, SG&amp;A, as a percent of net sales, rose to 41.4% from 35.1% reported in the year-ago quarter. Apart from the abovementioned reason, rising salaries and benefits to expand the organization to support the startup of new brands were a downside.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Financial AspectsInter Parfums ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 million, long-term debt (excluding the current portion) of $107.9 million and total equity of $730.1 million.Inter Parfums announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on Dec 30, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Dec 15, 2022.Other UpdatesDuring 2022, the company introduced several scents, namely Montblanc Legend Red, CoachWild Rose, Coach Dreams Sunset, Coach Open Road, GUESS Uomo, Kate Spade Sparkle, Jimmy Choo ManAqua, Jimmy Choo I Want Choo Forever, Lanvin Mon Éclat and Boucheron Singulier.

This house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands witnessed net sales growth but a decline in earnings per share. The parent of Coach and Kate Spade brands trimmed the fiscal year guidance due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and pandemic-induced restrictions in China.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureTapestry posted first-quarter earnings of 79 cents a share, which beat the consensus mark of 74 cents.

These helped offset an 11% decline in Greater China due to pandemic-related lockdowns and disruptions.Tapestry witnessed growth in the omnichannel, led by a low-single-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales at constant currency. This can be attributed to a high-single-digit jump in store revenues that offset a high-single-digit decline in digital.Story continuesMargin DiscussionThe consolidated gross profit came in at $1,054.6 million, down 1% from the year-ago period. Moreover, the gross margin contracted 220 basis points to 70%.

If you want to see more of the cheapest stocks on Robinhood, go directly to 5 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood.Robinhood is a trading app famous for offering free trades on stocks as a business model. Instead of making money from commissions, Robinhood makes money from interest, margin lending, payment for order flow and more.As a result of saving people substantial amounts in commissions, Robinhood is one of the largest brokers in the world today with 12.2 million monthly active users and 22.9 million net funded accounts as of Q3 2022.Recently, Robinhood stocks launched an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. Although some stocks in the popular 100 are meme stocks, some could be considered cheap in the long term given their competitive advantages and high quality businesses.20222022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Given inflation is still high, many analysts think the U.S. central bank could raise rates further.If rates go up, aggregate demand could decrease and demand for individual companies could weaken in the near term. Although the market has already priced in some of the economic slowdown, there could still be downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood, we took some of the most popular stocks in Robinhood that trade below the analyst average price target. To filter out meme stocks, we ensured that each stock had competitive advantages and scale.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares on the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.Story continues12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood12. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares have fallen substantially since the beginning of the pandemic given the decline in air travel. Although the company could face near term headwinds given macro headwinds, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) still has long term earnings growth potential given its scale and competitive advantages. Analysts have an average price target of $187.12 versus the price of $168.74 as of 11/9.Alongside Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the cheapest stocks that's popular on Robinhood.11. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has fallen 21.7% year to date due to the broader market weakness and macro headwinds. Nevertheless, some analysts such as David Palmer of Evercore ISI are bullish. Palmer has a $97 price target and an 'Outperform' rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) given his estimate of the company earning $3.39 in FY23 EPS. In the long term, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has high quality earnings potential that could justify a potentially higher valuation.10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Although Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares are down nearly 21% year to date, the company is a leader in R&amp;D given its development of Paxlovid. With a substantial product pipeline, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has potential for EPS growth in the future even if Wall Street is expecting the company's earnings per share to decline by an average of 1.8% per year for the next 5 years. With a forward P/E of around 9, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) could be a cheap stock in the long term.9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Although NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares are down almost 45% year to date due to rising inventories and increasing costs, the company nevertheless has a very strong brand. If macroeconomic conditions normalize, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) may be able to adjust with potentially more sales.Leaven Partners commented on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year. Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Given near term headwinds, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has fallen 53% year to date. According to Rajvindra Gill of Needham's analysis, there could be weaker than expected demand for semiconductor stocks in general in the trough part of the industry cycle. The broader market has also been weak. Nevertheless, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could still be a long term growth stock if it can achieve its potential. Analysts have an average price target of $190.5 per share for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) .7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Although a recession would be a headwind for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the near term, Carleton English of Barron's believes Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) along with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo could handle one assuming that it's not severe. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s balance sheet is stronger than it was several years ago and the bank has substantial long term earnings power. Analysts have an average price target of $41.1 per share for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares fell 13.16% on Wednesday after the company missed on earnings and the company guided for slower than expected growth for next year. Nevertheless, some analysts are still bullish. Shortly after the earnings report, Philip Cusick of JPMorgan cut his price target to $135 from $145, but still retained an 'Overweight' rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among the cheapest stocks that's popular on Robinhood.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Nasdaq Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up.As inflation fears continue to preside over the market, and the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates aggressively, the US dollar has skyrocketed while US Treasuries and shares across the world have been getting sold. During this time, the Nasdaq 100 Index has been performing well, showing a strong start in the third quarter and outperforming other major market benchmarks. According to a Nasdaq Index Research Team report published this October, the Nasdaq 100 Index outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 5.28% and 6.66%, respectively. In comparison, the Nasdaq 100 was only down by 4.32% over the third quarter of 2022.The Nasdaq Index is heavily dominated by technology stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), among many others. While in the beginning of 2022, tech stocks saw mass sell-offs during the market downturn, a T. Rowe Price analysis of stock performance during the years leading up to 2022 shows that tech stocks still returned over twice as much as the broader market. Between January 2022 and June 2022, the MSCI AC World Index returned 13.24%, while the MSCI AC World Information Technology Index returned 27.54%. The earnings for tech companies also surged during these years in light of the accelerated adoption of a range of tech trends such as cloud computing and online shopping, especially when the pandemic was at its peak.This morning inflation came in lower than expected and dropped below the 8% threshold for the first time in a long time. We believe this is finally the beginning of a trend as the Fed's rate hikes are finally affecting the inflation rate. Investing in smaller companies in the Nasdaq Index, particularly technology companies that are going ignored by investors in the market at present, is now beginning to seem like a smart investment strategy. Small-cap stocks are now becoming smarter choices because the US dollar is strong enough to boost their run. According to a Wall Street Journal article published in October, the S&amp;P 600 small-cap index rose by 5.3% that month, beating the large-cap S&amp;P 500's 2.6% gain. For 2022, the S&amp;P 600 is now on the path to outperform the broader benchmark for the first time since 2016. With tech stocks performing well in their own domain, and small-cap companies being on the winning end of the market for the first time in several years, now seems the perfect time to look at the stocks selected for our list below.Story continues10 Nasdaq Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes UpPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 10 Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy before Wall Street wakes up.Our MethodologyWe have selected mostly smaller companies that are going largely ignored among investors today. Most of these stocks are trading at share prices below $50-$60, and they have significant growth potential based on their key fundamentals such as revenue growth and net income or gross margins. We have ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Nasdaq Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up10. SmartRent, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SMRT) shares.SmartRent, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMRT) is a small company with significant growth potential. It is currently trading below $5, making it severely undervalued according to analysts such as those as Arie Investment Management. Demand for the company's solutions has been on the first in 2022, as shown by over 91,000 units being booked in the first quarter and the expansion of the company's customer base to 290 customers.

(NASDAQ:SMRT) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“We have discussed SmartRent, Inc. (NYSE:SMRT) at length in recent quarters. Demand for their products and services continues to be solid, but the company is facing supply chain issues that continue to impact its installation schedule. This combination has led the company to reduce guidance. We believe that the supply chain will continue to be a headwind but we are also starting to see some anecdotal evidence that the supply chain challenge is improving. We believe these supply chain challenges will continue to improve, allowing the company to produce free cash flow by second half of 2023. The company’s financial position remains strong, with $250mm in cash and no debt. This should enable the company to manage through this tough environment. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity ahead for the company.”SmartRent, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMRT), like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a Nasdaq stock worth keeping an eye on this year.9. PubMatic, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PUBM) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $21.9 million.8. Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UPST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Upstart Holdings, Inc.

It aggregates consumer demand for loans and connects them to its network of AI-enabled bank partners.John Hecht at Jefferies has a Hold rating on Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UPST) as of November 9. The analyst also placed a $20 price target on the stock.Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UPST) is a long-term buy, and considering that the stock is down over 80% so far this year, now is the perfect time to gain positions in the stock. The company's revenue is expected to become stable over the long run, helped by the addition of new partners to its AI-powered lending marketplace. Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UPST) has been expanding its presence among auto dealerships, and this is helping the company set up a brighter future.

(NASDAQ:UPST) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Upstart Holdings Inc. was a material detractor for the quarter. It was a mistake, and we sold our position. Upstart is an artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based lending platform. The company uses AI models that are designed to underwrite superior loans with lower interest rates, lower default rates, higher approval rates, and increased underwriting automation. When we purchased Upstart, we believed the company had an excellent product and the addressable market was large.Upstart’s results during 2021 were impressive. In the first quarter of 2022, the company reported solid results but lowered guidance and, more importantly, used its balance sheet to warehouse loans temporarily. The company’s decision to use its balance sheet to finance its growth surprised us and other market participants, and its stock price decreased dramatically. While we admire the management team, we are less confident in the company’s long-term prospects.It will be more difficult than we anticipated for Upstart to extend its competitive advantages with smaller banks into adjacent markets such as auto loans and mortgages. As a result, our value for Upstart is unstable and the company no longer qualifies for investment. We are following our discipline and reallocating capital into companies with more stable values.”7.

DXCM is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by its strong product portfolio. A robust third-quarter 2022 performance, along with a series of favorable coverage decisions, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and reimbursement risks persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 15.7% compared with a 33.7% decline of the industry and a 20.9% decline of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned medical devices company and provider of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems has a market capitalization of $44.55 billion. The company projects 31.4% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DexCom’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters, missed the same in two and matched estimates in one, delivering a negative earnings surprise of 10.07%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about DexCom's continued strength in its CGM products. It launched an updated sensor algorithm in five countries during the third quarter, making the latest G7 sensor technology available for international markets. The company anticipates FDA clearance for G7 sensor technology before 2022-end. The company, in August, announced the availability of the easy-to-use Dexcom ONE real-time CGM System on prescription via the NHS England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland drug tariff to everyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes using insulin.DexCom’s prospects in alternative markets such as non-intensive diabetes management, hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide it a competitive edge in the MedTech space.Positive Coverages: DexCom's products have been receiving increasing coverage over the past few months, raising our optimism. The company, in June, announced that people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes aged two years and above on multiple daily injections of insulin (three or more) or who use an insulin pump may now be eligible for public coverage of the Dexcom G6 CGM System via Prince Edward Island’s Diabetes Glucose Sensor Program.Story continuesThe Ontario government started coverage for the Dexcom G6 CGM System through Ontario’s Assistive Devices Program for people with type 1 diabetes living in the province who are above the age of 2 years and meet coverage criteria in March.Strong Q3 Results: DexCom’s solid third-quarter 2022 revenues buoy optimism. Rising volumes across all channels, along with strong new customer additions, owing to increasing global awareness of the benefits of real-time CGM, contributed to the upside. Impressive contributions from the Sensor segment and domestic and international revenue growth were key catalysts. DexCom also received CE Mark for an updated sensor algorithm, making the latest G7 sensor technology available for international markets.DownsidesReimbursement Risk: Reimbursement risk is somewhat high due to the efforts to control healthcare expenses. The company noted that most type 1 patients (above 65) pay 100% of their CGM costs from their own pockets. Unless payers (both government and private insurers) are provided with sufficient coverage and reimbursement, commercial success for DexCom will be limited, in our view.Stiff Competition: The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. DexCom’s competitors manufacture and market products for the single-point finger stick device market and collectively account for substantially all worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems, currently.Estimate TrendDexCom is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.3% north to 80 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $810.3 million, suggesting a 16.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The same for earnings per share stood at 28 cents, implying 64.7% growth year over year.DexCom, Inc. PriceDexCom, Inc. PriceDexCom, Inc. price | DexCom, Inc.

It's obtained when the undesirable components of biogas, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, are removed.In many cases, RNG is made at facilities that generate a feedstock as a by-product of their operations. Wastewater treatment plants and dairy farms, for example, can produce RNG using sewage sludge and manure, respectively. Another option is to process food waste into biogas and RNG.The Cummins executive says the Argonne National Laboratory's database captures the total annual RNG production capacity in the United States. In 2021, production capacity was about 660 million gallons of gasoline equivalents (GGE). That's a 20% increase compared to the previous year.That is a lot of RNG, but still just a fraction - about 3% - of the total natural gas consumption each year in the country, beyond solely vehicles' consumption.It may be possible to increase the production of RNG in the United States-and in other countries-by orders of magnitude. According to a study quoted by the American Gas Association, the United States could have the potential to produce up to 36 billion GGE equivalent of RNG each year by 2040.If all of that was used in transportation applications, that would be enough to fuel about two-thirds of all diesel vehicles in the country.Producing RNG is only part of the challenge to making more available, Singh Jhawar writes. RNG also needs to be transported and distributed to end-users.Story continuesCompared to other alternative fuels, RNG has many advantages. RNG is, chemically speaking, nearly identical to natural gas obtained from fossil resources. So RNG can be injected into the existing natural gas transportation and distribution infrastructure, as long as it meets each pipeline's specifications.However, the network of natural gas fueling stations is less dense than the one for gasoline or diesel. There are about 1,500 public and private stations dispending compressed natural gas in the United States, compared to over 150,000 gas stations with gasoline or diesel.Most of the RNG supply is sent to states with low carbon fuel credits for natural gas.To learn more, check out the full article at the Cummins' website.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: http://cummins.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725037/Cummins-Executive-Says-Renewable-Natural-Gas-Has-Potential-and-Challenges]"

That said, investors will be watching Disney's execution carefully as the fight for ad dollars escalates.""Disney has a burden of the brand where there's a higher expectation in the quality of the ads experience,"" Eunice Shin, a partner at consulting firm Prophet, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). She explained that ad buyers will have ""a very broad spectrum of where they can go and place their ads — that creates a very competitive marketplace.""Disney stock began to recover on Thursday amid a broader market rally, rising by more than 4% as of the market close. Shares plummeted in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations across the board, with the exception of subscriber net additions. Those losses accelerated on Wednesday as investors zeroed in on Disney's weakening park revenue and widening losses within the company's streaming division.Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ lost a combined $1.5 billion in Q4 after losing $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Average revenue per user for Disney+ also disappointed, dropping to $3.91 (vs. estimates of $4.29) amid an adverse foreign exchange impact and a larger subscriber mix.Management said that it expects streaming losses to shrink by about $200 million in the first quarter of 2023 and that Disney+ is still on track to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024.(Courtesy: Disney / Marvel)One way the company plans to hit that target is through advertising.Shin noted that Disney's top challenge will be crafting an ad experience that doesn't create friction on the platform and helps it stand out relative to competitors.""How do you win in a compelling space with a lot of competition and a lot of expectations?"" Shin emphasized. ""Media buyers are expecting a return. They're expecting results. Disney+ and all these other streamers are really going to have to deliver on that.""Story continuesKutgun Maral, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, warned in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live that the ad tier will likely take time to grow.""It's probably more of a back half of 2023, and more meaningfully in 2024, kind of event in terms of the upside we see from advertising,"" he surmised, adding, ""Part of the upside on this ad-supported tier will hinge on, hopefully, an improved macro environment.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Disney+ saw net subscriber additions rise to 12 million in the fourth quarter, beating expectations of just over 9 million. The beat came after the company reported a surge of subscribers in the third quarter (14.4 million) following new market launches and a robust slate of content.The company warned that it expects core Disney+ subscriber growth and Indian service Hotstar subscriber numbers to be lower in the first quarter.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with those expectations. Hey, Allie.ALLIE CANAL: Hey, Seana. And yes, it is a huge movie for theaters, which, quite honestly, has been lacking that big, splashy box office title for quite some time. But we finally have that with ""Wakanda Forever."" The film just grossed a little over 10 million after opening in 17 foreign markets on Wednesday, but the domestic expectations are much higher.According to Boxoffice Pro, the film is expected to generate between 170 million to 205 million in opening weekend ticket sales. So far, reviews have been pretty strong, 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. Pre-sales also at a nice pace, so it's possible that this could be the biggest opening movie of the year. Currently, that title is held by another Marvel film, ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"" which garnered 187.4 million in its domestic start. So anything over that would be a huge win.And just a little context on the numbers here. The original ""Black Panther"" generated a 202 million domestic opener in 2018 before finishing its theatrical run at 700.1 million domestically, and then a whopping 1.35 billion globally. So the bar is certainly there, but there are some risks.I spoke with Shawn Robbins. He's the chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro. He told me that the film has a runtime of two hours and 41 minutes. That could hurt it, particularly for a family that might not feel the need to rush out and see this long of a film on opening weekend.Additionally, we have the passing of Chadwick Boseman. He does not appear in this sequel, and that remains a big swing factor, especially for the more casual viewer who saw the first ""Black Panther,"" loved his character, loved that film. Ultimately, how does this franchise move on without Chadwick?And then, finally, there has been some Marvel fatigue, both at the box office. And then on Disney+, we did see some success with ""Doctor Strange,"" along with ""Thor."" However, there was a little bit of mixed reception so there is that risk that that could carry over into this film as well. So a lot of questions, but certainly a ton of anticipation. And the box office couldn't be happier this film is finally about to arrive.]"

Instead of making money from commissions, Robinhood makes money from interest, margin lending, payment for order flow and more.As a result of saving people substantial amounts in commissions, Robinhood is one of the largest brokers in the world today with 12.2 million monthly active users and 22.9 million net funded accounts as of Q3 2022.Recently, Robinhood stocks launched an index that featured 100 stocks that are popular with the company's userbase. Although some stocks in the popular 100 are meme stocks, some could be considered cheap in the long term given their competitive advantages and high quality businesses.20222022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Given inflation is still high, many analysts think the U.S. central bank could raise rates further.If rates go up, aggregate demand could decrease and demand for individual companies could weaken in the near term. Although the market has already priced in some of the economic slowdown, there could still be downside if economic data doesn't meet expectations. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood, we took some of the most popular stocks in Robinhood that trade below the analyst average price target. To filter out meme stocks, we ensured that each stock had competitive advantages and scale.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares on the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.Story continues12 Cheapest Stocks on Robinhood12. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares have fallen substantially since the beginning of the pandemic given the decline in air travel. Although the company could face near term headwinds given macro headwinds, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) still has long term earnings growth potential given its scale and competitive advantages. Analysts have an average price target of $187.12 versus the price of $168.74 as of 11/9.Alongside Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is one of the cheapest stocks that's popular on Robinhood.11. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has fallen 21.7% year to date due to the broader market weakness and macro headwinds. Nevertheless, some analysts such as David Palmer of Evercore ISI are bullish. Palmer has a $97 price target and an 'Outperform' rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) given his estimate of the company earning $3.39 in FY23 EPS. In the long term, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has high quality earnings potential that could justify a potentially higher valuation.10. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Although Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shares are down nearly 21% year to date, the company is a leader in R&amp;D given its development of Paxlovid. With a substantial product pipeline, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has potential for EPS growth in the future even if Wall Street is expecting the company's earnings per share to decline by an average of 1.8% per year for the next 5 years. With a forward P/E of around 9, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) could be a cheap stock in the long term.9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Although NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares are down almost 45% year to date due to rising inventories and increasing costs, the company nevertheless has a very strong brand. If macroeconomic conditions normalize, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) may be able to adjust with potentially more sales.Leaven Partners commented on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year. Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Given near term headwinds, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has fallen 53% year to date. According to Rajvindra Gill of Needham's analysis, there could be weaker than expected demand for semiconductor stocks in general in the trough part of the industry cycle. The broader market has also been weak. Nevertheless, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could still be a long term growth stock if it can achieve its potential. Analysts have an average price target of $190.5 per share for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) .7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Although a recession would be a headwind for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the near term, Carleton English of Barron's believes Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) along with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo could handle one assuming that it's not severe. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s balance sheet is stronger than it was several years ago and the bank has substantial long term earnings power. Analysts have an average price target of $41.1 per share for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares fell 13.16% on Wednesday after the company missed on earnings and the company guided for slower than expected growth for next year. Nevertheless, some analysts are still bullish. Shortly after the earnings report, Philip Cusick of JPMorgan cut his price target to $135 from $145, but still retained an 'Overweight' rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Visa Inc.

235,cf424446-13d8-302a-8da9-0a1b0f8c7d73,UA,2022-11-11,23 Penny Stocks to Buy for a MASSIVE Bull Market in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/23-penny-stocks-buy-massive-173636273.html,1667842596,STORY,"['BBBY', 'UAA', 'WW', 'SABR', 'SWIM', 'SOFI', 'MG', 'HTZ']","[Last week, tech stocks closed 20% above their recent lows, an astonishingly accurate indicator of new bull markets. With the exception of the 2001 crash, every 20% recovery since 1980 has been met with double-digit returns the following year. A similar boost today would add $9.2 trillion to the stock marketAs a percentage, these profits are often magnified among penny stocks. In 2020, car rental firm Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) jumped 1,100% after recovering car prices and a takeover bid from Knighthead Capital Management sent shares soaring.“Hertz could become the top penny stock of 2021,” I wrote a month before the deal. “Bankruptcy proceedings usually leave equity investors with nothing… [but] Hertz might join American Airlines as an exception.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPenny stocks can also do well without a potential bankruptcy on their books. Shares of Bowflex maker Nautilus (NYSE:NLS) rose 1,900% the same year.The Power of Penny StocksThese stunning returns are made possible by ultra-low valuations. At 56 cents, Hertz’s over-the-counter shares valued the car rental firm at less than $100 million — a 99.6% drop from its peak reached in 2014. And at its nadir, Nautilus traded at less than 0.075x price-to-sales (P/S) at its $1.20 price.Penny stocks are also particularly sensitive to the economic climate. In 2020, shares of companies trading for less than $5 dropped an average of 37%, underperforming companies over $100 by 700 basis points.That’s why penny stocks are so rewarding in recovering markets. Rising investor confidence, improving financial liquidity and higher risk appetites tend to impact shares of higher-risk stocks more than they do with lower-risk ones. As Federal Reserve policy begins to loosen in 2023 as markets expect, many penny stocks will rebound.A Word of Warning on Penny StocksThe massive upside, however, also comes with equally large risks. Many stocks under $1 trade on the OTC (over-the-counter) markets, where reporting standards are more relaxed. Pink sheet companies are not required to provide audited financial reports, and many “shell” companies exist only as financial tools for their owners.Story continuesSmall market capitalizations can also make these penny stocks a target for market manipulation. In 2020, the former CEO of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) settled with the SEC for “lucrative market manipulation,” after running a “classic pump-and-dump scheme” on his company’s shares. And even well-meaning management teams can have their stocks hijacked by market promoters or social media influencers if the company’s float is small enough.Finally, low trading volume can limit the size of any given investment, even for ordinary investors. Buying up $1,000 of a $1 stock would take two business weeks (10 days) or more if sellers are only parting with 100 shares each day.Nevertheless, studies have long shown that penny stocks provide abnormal returns beyond what traditional models predict. And for investors looking to ride a wave of investor optimism, penny stocks are one of the best places to put fundamental and quantitative research to work.A Quantitative Approach to Penny Stock InvestingI’ve written at length on fundamental approaches to penny stock investing. By taking fewer shots on goal, investors can maximize their returns if any single winner emerges.The strategy does come with significant risks. My No. 1 penny stock pick for 2022, for instance, is down 62% for the year, while my No. 2 pick gained 103%. Investors with insufficient diversification could have lost money this year.To counter that, my list of 23 penny stocks to buy includes a wide range of companies chosen by my Profit &amp; Protection system. It’s a proven method that has analyzed years of past data to find what works in the markets, and grades companies based on their ability to generate returns over the following 12 months.The system often picks unintuitive candidates. In May, the system named the struggling Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) as a “growth” stock for its turnaround potential. BBBY shares would rise 150% soon after. And even near-bankrupt firms like Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) can earn A+ scores for their potential as a short-squeeze candidate. When a stock borders on zero, the only way it can often go is up.As markets prepare for a 2023 rebound, here are 23 top penny stocks to buy.23 Penny Stocks to Buy Before the Market RecoversVelodyne Lidar (VLDR)Image of the Velodyne Lidar (VLDR) sign outside the company's headquarters.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: B| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: ATopping my quantitative Profit &amp; Protection list of penny stocks is Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR), a promising San Jose-based autonomous vehicle firm. Shares now trade for under $1 after a brutal selloff in the first half 2022, pricing the company at 1x forward book value.Analysts are now projecting a stunning 62% growth rate in 2023 and 94% in 2024, pushing Velodyne’s growth score into the A+ range and its average score to an A.There are some issues, of course, with the company at the fundamental level. Firstly, the company lags behind rival Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) in R&amp;D. Penny stock investors are banking on a No. 2 player. Secondly, my quantitative “quality” score overstates Velodyne’s intrinsic quality; rapid operating earnings growth will still leave the company in the red until at least 2025. And finally, its upcoming merger with rival Ouster (NYSE:OUST) creates near-term M&amp;A risk for investors.Nevertheless, Velodyne is a promising bet on the future of autonomous driving. If its high quantitative scores are any indication, it’s picks like these that tend to outperform over the next 12 months.Skillz (SKLZ)Skillz (SKLZ) company logo on a websiteSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A| Value: A| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: ASkillz (NYSE:SKLZ), the mobile e-sports platform, saw revenues drop 18% in Q2 2022. Shares are down 86% year to date to $1.“Positioning the company for profitability had a real cost,” admitted co-founder and CEO Andrew Paradise in the company’s Q2 call. “Revenue after engagement marketing, paying monthly active users, all fell sequentially quarter-over-quarter.”But the company’s renewed focus on profitability has helped the firm in other ways. The company reduced its net loss by almost $90 million that quarter, and closed loopholes of user cheating. Wall Street analysts now expect that revenues at the San Francisco-based firm will stabilize at $262 million in 2023 and rise above $300 million the following year.These factors have helped push Skillz’s Profit &amp; Protection scores solidly into the A range. Seven of the 11 analysts covering Skillz now have target prices that imply potential gains of 40% or higher. Though Skillz’ share price has turned the promising gaming firm into a penny stock, quantitative research has shown that such firms can come roaring back.RealReal (REAL)The RealReal website on a smartphone representing REAL stock.Source: Ascannio/Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A+| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+The discount e-commerce firm RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) has one of the highest Profit &amp; Protection scores possible. And not without good reason.“The luxury apparel resale space has been chronically underserved,” notes Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop. “The RealReal’s business model exists to serve this end market more efficiently… We view the firm’s strategy as sound and believe that ongoing investments in fulfillment efficiency, brick-and-mortar stores, and diversified supply sourcing represent a solid roadmap toward profitability and (potentially) excess returns.”Analysts have good reasons to remain bullish. RealReal follows in the footsteps of other successful discounters (Gilt Groupe, RueLaLa) and adds additional barriers to entry with a network of thousands of consignor buyers. Rapidly improving returns help drive the e-commerce’s “quality” score to an A+.RealReal also earns an A+ for growth. Analysts are expecting a 34% revenue growth rate in 2022, followed by 21% in 2023 and 26% in 2024, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.As the U.S. economy recovers from its recessionary slump, revenues and earnings at the Real Real should increase. Wall Street expects revenues to rise 20% in 2023 to $755, and for the firm to break even on an EBITDA basis the year after. And at under $1.50, the true bargain might be RealReal’s shares.AppHarvest (APPH)Rows of plants being farmed indoorsSource: Silga Bauge-Robezniece / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+AppHarvest (NASDAQ:APPH) is one of the fastest-growing food production firms in America. The company expects to have 165 acres of high-value greenhouse space by the end of 2022, which should generate almost $100 million in revenue next year. AppHarvest could earn as much as a 25% gross margin on goods, according to Wall Street analysts, earning the company a solid B+ quality score.The Appalachian-based firm is a leader in large greenhouse operations. Its 60-acre Morehead CEA greenhouse is one of the world’s largest and uses around 90% less water than traditional open-field production.Shares of the firm, however, have been battered by controversy. Activists have filed lawsuits, alleging misleading press releases and presentations; the involvement of polarizing politician J. D. Vance has further increased scrutiny of the firm.Still, these low prices award AppHarvest an A grade for value. The company now trades for book value, reducing the potential downside for investors. And an improved harvest in 2023 could surprise markets to the upside. Though AppHarvest remains a highly speculative penny stock, the Profit &amp; Protection system has flagged shares as a potential growth and turnaround firm.Aeva Technologies Inc (AEVA)Autonomous self driving electric car using lidar change the lane and overtakes city vehicleSource: temp-64GTX / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: ARumors have long swirled that the Aeva (NYSE:AEVA), a laser-sensor startup, could eventually help Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) create its first Apple car. The small firm was founded by two ex-Apple engineers, one of which helped develop the Apple Watch.Aeva has already received strategic investments from Porsche (OTCMKTS:POAHY) and management believes they could generate revenue from series production by 2024. Wall Street analysts agree, giving Aeva a $215 million revenue target for that year. Its growth score stands at an excellent A+.The Mountain View, California-based firm has plenty of hurdles. Its sagging share price and a $235 million cash burn in the past year give it limited scope to fundraise. And its $380 million cash pile could run out by mid-2024 if the firm misses revenue projections. The firm only earns a B+ in quality for these reasons and more.Still, penny stock investors have good reason to expect Aeva to succeed, or at least get acquired by a larger firm. Aeva focuses on the software end of lidar, an often overlooked area of laser sensors. And its $400 market capitalization makes it possible for would-be acquirers to swallow.Workhorse Group (WKHS)A Workhorse (WKHS) W-15 hybrid electric pickup truck on display at a branding event in Flatiron Plaza in New York.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B+| Momentum: A| Total: AIn August, California green-lighted legislation that would ban all new gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035. Many states like Massachusetts have trigger laws that will follow the Golden State’s lead.That’s creating a windfall for electric vehicle makers, including electric truck maker Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS).Since ejecting its former CEO Steve Burns in 2021, Workhorse’s management has focused on turning the company around.“We are gaining commercial momentum,” CEO Richard Dauch said in the company’s Q2 2022 earnings call. “Make no mistake, Workhorse is a fundamentally different company today than it was a year ago.” The company now has a full medium-duty EV portfolio and has secured a significant purchase order for commercial vehicles.Analysts now expect Workhorse to generate $127 million in revenue for 2023 and $325 million for 2024, up from only $18 million in 2022. These factors award Workhorse an A+ in growth and an A grade overall.The company’s beaten-down shares could be next to rise. WHKS trades at under $2.70 despite having zero debt.FuelCell Energy (FCEL)An image of the FuelCell (FCEL Stock) logo.Source: Bern James / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+In many ways, FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) was the poster child of 2021 speculation. Company shares rose from $2 to $26 in a frenzy over green technologies. For a brief moment in time, hydrogen seemed to be the next frontier in new-age energy.Shares would eventually fall back to $3 after the company failed to meet Wall Street’s lofty expectations……But look under the hood, and the firm is still growing.The company is on track to generate $134 million in revenue this year, up 93% from the year before. And at current rates, the firm could break even in 2025. The firm earns an A+ for growth from my quantitative Profit &amp; Protection system.Energy shortages in Europe have also reignited interest in green hydrogen. Multiple deals are now in the works to supply northern Europe with millions of tons of hydrogen derived from renewable energy. Rising profitability gives FCEL an A+ for quality.That puts FuelCell in a strong position. Analysts now expect the firm to grow an average of 28% through 2024. And if the company reaches these targets, investors should expect its shares to recover in short order.8×8 (EGHT)hands holding smartphone with social media icons floating above it. brick wall background.Source: ShutterstockGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: A+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+8×8 (NYSE:EGHT) is an unusual penny stock for its profitability. The provider of voice, team chat and other online communication tools has seen EBIT grow from a $60.88 million loss in 2020 to an expected $32 million this year, earning itself an A+ for quality. Wall Street analysts are expecting another 59% boost in operating profits next year as more firms adopt permanent remote work policies.The Campbell, California-based firm is also relatively established, with 2.5 million paid business customers using its services. (Though this lowers its growth score slightly to an A-). Its gross profit margin comes in at a healthy 67%.None of this has helped 8×8’s stock price. Shares have fallen from $35 into the $3.50 range, mirroring similar losses at rival cloud communication providers Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO).Nevertheless, 8×8 remains a high-potential bet on a profitable firm, according to its Profit &amp; Protection scores. Shares trade at mild 14x forward price-to-earnings (P/E), making this overall A+ penny stock one of the best values on Wall Street today.Latham Group (SWIM)Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming poolSource: ShutterstockGrowth: B+| Value: A+| Quality: B-| Momentum: A+| Total: A-Latham Group (NASDAQ:SWIM) is the largest designer, producer and marketer of in-ground residential swimming pools in North America. It’s also one of Wall Street’s cheapest deep-value stocks. At $4.50, SWIM trades at 6.2x P/E and under 5x price-to-cashflow, earning an A+ in value.These low valuations are a product of an unusually heavy debt load. The firm holds $263 million in long-term debt from a private equity deal in 2015, and interest payments have consumed at least 45% of operating income every year. No matter how much cash flow Latham Group produces, much of it goes back into creditor hands. Its quality is firmly in the B- range.That could change in 2023 and beyond as the firm continues to grow and pay down debt. In his Q2 earnings call, CFO Robert Masson gave updated guidance of 19% to 22% topline year-over-year growth. Price momentum is also working in Latham’s favor, according to the Profit &amp; Protection system. Though it won’t be a smooth ride up, Latham remains one of the system’s top penny stock picks to watch as a turnaround play.WW International (WW)Indianapolis - Circa August 2020: WW International studio, formally Weight Watchers location.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: A| Momentum: A+| Total: AShares of the New York-based wellness company WW International (NASDAQ:WW) have admittedly yo-yoed like a diet gone bad. Shares ballooned from $4 to over $100 between 2015 and 2018 after TV personality Oprah Winfrey bought a significant stake……only to drop back to $4.50 again four years later.Today, the company formerly known as Weight Watchers has become a top penny stock for its cheap share price, high quality and turnaround-like momentum.First, WW International scores an A+ in value for its absurdly low 3.2x price-to-cashflow ratio. It’s one of the cheapest companies on the stock market by that metric.Next, there’s quality, where WW scores an A. The firm has managed to remain profitable every year since 1997, an achievement that few penny stocks can claim.Finally, there’s momentum. WW shares have fallen 53% in the past six months and are down 73% year to date. The Profit &amp; Protection system has shown that such negative price momentum is often followed by a large bounce.Though WW International has allowed its overheads to bloat over the years, shares remain attractive at $4.50, especially if cost-cutting measures (belt-tightening, anyone?) begin to work.Consolidated Communications (CNSL)Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. (CNCL) logo displayed on smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A| Value: A+| Quality: B-| Momentum: C| Total: B+Consolidated Communications Holding (NASDAQ:CNSL), the broadband provider, has struggled with a high debt load. The company generated $118 million operating income in FY2021, only to post a $100 million net loss after counting interest and other non-operating charges. Company shares trade at 0.5x price-to-sales, around a less than a fifth of rival Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR).Ordinarily, most investors would pass over CNSL as a has-been player in a slow-growth market. But the quantitative Profit &amp; Protection stock-picking system is predicting a turnaround. Analysts expect that cost-cutting will help the company stem losses to $24 million this year — a marked improvement from 2021. And the firm’s $1.025 billion of net assets provides some downside; the firm could theoretically sell its assets to a larger competitor if cash gets tight.Though the company’s momentum is pointing to a tough year ahead, patient investors will find it worthwhile to keep CNSL on their radar for when prices begin to tick back up. The firm’s A+ value is too cheap to pass up.Virgin Galactic (SPCE)Virgin Galactic (SPCE) banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange building to celebrate its IPO.Source: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A| Quality: B- | Momentum: A+| Total: A-Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is an unusual firm to find in the penny stock bargain bin. The company went public in one of the first blockbuster SPAC deals on Wall Street, raising $674 million in the process. Shares of the space tourism company would go on to trade as high as $55 in the frothy 2021 market.Today, Virgin Galactic’s $5 price tag has made it attractive to the quantitative Profit &amp; Protection system. Analysts still believe the company could generate as much as $350 million in revenue by 2026, according to surveys by Thomson Reuters, giving the firm an A+ growth grade. And SPCE’s negative momentum indicates a firm that could rebound over a value-driven turnaround. Though SPCE remains risky for its low quality, my Profit &amp; Protection system is beginning to label the space travel firm as a potential turnaround to ride.Harsco (HSC)Bins are filled with various recyclibles, including cardboard, glass, and plasticSource: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: B| Momentum: A+| Total: A-If you’ve ever wanted to know what a Warren Buffett “cigar-butt” company looks like, Harsco (NYSE:HSC) is about as close as you can get. The waste management firm helps industrial companies recycle metal, manage scrap and process waste before it goes into landfills. Not exactly a high-growth industry at first glance.The company’s declining quality has also weighed down its quantitative scores. Pre-tax profits have fallen from a $113 million peak in 2018 to $37.5 million in 2021 on higher overhead costs and declining margins. The company only scores a moderate B in qualityBut the same forces have also pushed Harsco’s shares into deep value territory. At under $6, HSC shares now value the company at around 0.5x price-to-book and earns a solid A+ grade for value. And growth isn’t a lost cause either. Wall Street analysts are projecting a return to operating income growth by 2023 as industrial output picks back up. Harsco earns an A- for growth.Together these factors suggest that investors should still consider this beaten-down penny stock as the market rebounds.Mistras Group (MG)Pipelines in the desertSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: B+| Momentum: C| Total: A-The New Jersey-based Mistras Group (NYSE:MG) scores relatively well on the Profit &amp; Protection system, earning an A- overall for its high value and quality.The energy service company operates an asset protection system, which helps energy, manufacturing and power firms inspect pipelines and other essential assets. It’s a cyclical business that saw declines in 2016 and 2020. Its quality lags at a B+ grade for that reason.A boom in U.S. energy, however, is quickly pushing the industry back into a boom. Wall Street analysts now expect Mistras to generate $800 million in revenue by 2024, a significant increase from the $677 million generated in 2021. Earnings could double to $14.4 million next year, earning Mistras Group an A-for growth. The firm also trades at an excellent 12.8x P/E ratio, earning an A+ for value.These figures have helped award Mistras Group an overall score of A-. If energy prices rebound as many analysts expect, Mistras Group could see its momentum score follow upwards in short order.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)the Social Finance (SoFi stock) logo is displayed on a smartphone.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: B+| Quality: A+| Momentum: A| Total: AInvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango has long pounded the table on SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI), a highly promising fintech.“SoFi stock has been absolutely crushed over the past year… But as the old saying goes, it’s always darkest before the dawn. By 2030, it’ll rise around 25X from current levels.”Now, the Profit &amp; Protection system has also flagged SOFI as a top pick. Net interest income is expected to double in 2022 to $515 million, and increase to $842 million by 2024 as rates continue to rise. And analysts are now projecting positive operating income by 2024. These factors help award SoFi a solid A+ for growth.SoFi also has some surprising quality behind the numbers. The company has aggressively grown to become an “Amazon of finance” by cutting deals with existing providers of everything from financial planning to insurance products. The firm could legitimately become worth multiples of its current $5.20 penny stock price.There are some concerns, of course. The company scores an average B+ in its value score for a relatively rich price. And the quantitative Profit &amp; Protection system misses much of SoFi’s bank risk, since such figures don’t show up in financials until it’s far too late.Still, SoFi remains a top penny stock for its massive growth runway, strong turnaround momentum and the potential to bring online banking to the masses once and for all. Don’t expect SoFi to languish at $5 forever.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)bed bath &amp; beyond storefront (BBBY)Source: ShutterstockGrowth: A| Value: A+| Quality: B-| Momentum: A+| Total: A-In May, the Profit &amp; Protection system flagged home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond as a promising turnaround play. Shares had become so cheap that the only direction the meme stock could go was up.Shares would rise 150% within two months.Today, a new slump in BBBY shares provides a second chance for risk-seeking investors. Markets price the lossmaking firm at 0.2x sales, and the company’s negative momentum is setting up the stock for a short-term bounce. It’s a typical turnaround play that the Profit &amp; Protection system loves to flag.None of this means that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond will succeed in the long run. The company scores a B- in quality, and analysts expect the firm will keep generating losses through FY2025. But historically, near-bankrupt firms from Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) to JC Penney provided plenty of opportunities for speculation before they finally went under for good.Altice USA (ATUS)A blurred image of a television studioSource: chanonnat srisura / Shutterstock.comGrowth: C| Value: A+| Quality: A| Momentum: A+| Total: B+Altice USA’s (NYSE:ATUS) growth score of C should immediately warn investors. The NYC-based cable television provider is expected to see revenues decrease by 4% next year as more consumers cut cords. Net income could drop as much as 11% to $565 million, a 43% decline from 2021 levels.Yet, ATUS provides a compelling penny stock investment for its steady cash flows and low share price. Analysts expect the firm to generate almost $500 million in free cash flow next year, pricing the stock at an astonishing 5.7X price-to-free-cashflow (P/FCF). The firm earns an A+ for value.The company’s price momentum also shares elements of other turnaround plays. The stock has declined 55% over the past six months to $4.70, and stabilized in October. Such patterns are indicative of a near-term bounce.Altice is far from a growth company. But experienced investors in other deep-value penny stocks will immediately recognize the potential for making quick cash.Sabre Corp (SABR)The logo for Sabre Corporation (SABR) is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A+| Quality: A+| Momentum: B+| Total: A+Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) is one of the four major Global Distribution Systems, centralized databases of airline and hotel bookings. It’s an oligopolistic business that’s helped Sabre, Amadeus and Travelport generate years of profitable growth.The Covid-19 pandemic upended that notion. Sabre lost $1 billion in 2020 and another $677 million in 2021, sending its richly valued shares into penny stock territory. Today, shares change hands for less than $5.But the Profit &amp; Protection system is starting to see a turnaround for Sabre and its GDS peers. Wall Street analysts are now projecting a 55% increase in 2022 revenue and another 26% for next year. Operating earnings are expected to turn positive again in 2023, earning Sabre an A+ for both growth and quality.Signs are already emerging that air travel demand is back on the rise. In October, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) noted that “consumer appetite for travel is showing no signs of slowing down despite high airfares and concerns about the economy.” Shares would jump 7% on the news.As travelers take back to the skies, Sabre and other GDS firms stand to benefit. Don’t expect Sabre to remain a penny stock for long.Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI)The Sirius XM (SIRI) mobile app logo on a smartphone screen.Source: ShutterstockGrowth: B+| Value: B| Quality: A+| Momentum: B+| Total: B+The high-quality Sirius XM Holdings is a “safer” play for penny stock investors. The company earns a high A+ in quality for its abnormally large profit margins, but scores lower in growth, value and momentum.A closer look under the hood shows why. Revenues are expected to grow between 3%-4% through 2024, and net income ~5% despite its 2019 acquisition of Pandora. It’s a metronome, not a meteor, when it comes to growth thanks to management’s “slow-and-steady” approach.Similarly, Sirius XM isn’t particularly cheap. Shares trade at 20x P/E, well within striking distance of rival Apple. It’s priced as a tech company, not as a telecom.Still, the stock represents a relatively safe way for investors to buy into penny stocks. Sirius’ management has remained relatively disciplined in capital expenditure and has consistently bought back shares with free cash flow. SIRI won’t be the most exciting penny stock to buy, but it’s certainly a safer bet, according to its Profit &amp; Protection scores.Turtle Beach (HEAR)Image of a gamer with a headset facing a screenSource: Donna Lupgens / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A| Value: A+| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: A+Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR), the California-based gaming headphone firm, is about as cyclical as they come. Shares peaked at over $80 in 2013 before dropping to $2 by 2017……Rose to $27 in 2018 and dropped to $5 in 2020……Rose to $33 in 2021 before…Well, you get the idea. Turtle Beach is a fashion company masquerading as a gaming firm. The company only earns a B+ for its gyrating quality.Yet, HEAR is offering another chance for investors to jump back in. Shares trade at $8, and the $100 million firm now earns an A+ for momentum after its recent stabilization.Analysts also remain bullish about this cyclical firm. Revenues are expected to recover to $325 million next year, a 19% year-over-year increase while operating income should hit $15 million. Turtle Beach consequently earns an A grade for growth.That makes Turtle Beach a solid turnaround play, according to its quantitative scores. Much like Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, this cyclical firm could still have more left to give.1-800-Flowers.Com (FLWS)1-800-flowers logo and storefrontSource: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: A-| Momentum: A+| Total: AShares of the e-commerce firm 1-800-Flowers.com (NASDAQ:FLWS) collapsed in 2022 over rising overhead costs and compressing margins. FY2022 operating earnings came in at $45 million, down from $152 million the year before. Its quality score has fallen to an A-Yet, declining stock prices have pushed the 46-year-old firm into the A+ value territory. Shares now trade at 0.21x price-to-sales (P/S), a 66% discount to its 0.6x long-run average. And a 7x EV/EBITDA ratio puts the firm in a similar league to brick-and-mortar companies like Sally Beauty Holdings (NYSE:SBH).These prices make little sense. 1-800-Flowers.com is a capital-light firm with relatively few retail locations; a 3-stage discounted cash flow model (DCF) suggests a justified value closer to $14, not $8.Markets are beginning to agree. Prices of FLWS are up almost 35% in the past month after falling 70% this year — a pattern that suggests a momentum breakout could soon follow.Under Armour (UAA)the exterior of an Under Armour storeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A-| Value: A+| Quality: B+| Momentum: A+| Total: AShares of Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) have been on a rollercoaster ride since 2014, reaching peaks in 2015, 2019 and 2021, while seeing troughs in 2017, 2020 and 2022. Such volatility dents the firm’s growth and quality scores. Industry-wide issues with supply chain and inventory levels have compounded UAA stock’s retreat from its $27 high this year to $8 today.Under Armour has also fallen behind its competitors in product innovation, instead choosing to pursue the lower-end market. 90% of its North American locations are off-price, according to research by Morningstar analysts.Nevertheless, shares have finally become too cheap for my quant system to ignore. UAA shares trade at 1.75x price-to-sales, less than half of Nike’s (NYSE:NKE) value. And a slight share price recovery in October after a massive H1 fall gives the firm an A+ for momentum.Analysts are also beginning to reverse course on negative estimates. Revenues are now expected to grow in the mid-single digits through 2025. All this points to a potential turnaround for the Maryland-based firm. Though Under Armour will continue on its rollercoaster ride, signs are mounting that it’s now reached a bottom.JetBlue (JBLU)jetblue (JBLU) airplane on a runwaySource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comGrowth: A+| Value: A+| Quality: A| Momentum: B+| Total: AFinally, New York-based Jet Blue (NASDAQ:JBLU) rounds out the list of well-rated stocks under the Profit &amp; Protection system.The company is a growth powerhouse, with 2022 revenues expected to rise 52% on increased travel demand and a merger with Spirit Airlines. Analysts expect operating income to move from a $913 million loss in 2021 to a $405 million gain by 2023. The airline earns a stunning A+ for growth.JetBlue’s valuation is also compelling. After falling 45% this year to $8, the airline’s shares now trade at a 0.27x price-to-sales. Of its rivals, only American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) trades cheaper by that metric.The result: a travel stock with the potential for 100% gains. In mid-October shares of rival United Airlines rose more than 7% after its CEO noted how “consumer appetite for travel is showing no signs of slowing down.” And with oil prices moderating since last summer, shares of JetBlue could have plenty of room for takeoff in the next bull market.Conclusion: When to Buy Penny Stocks?Penny stocks represent some of the highest-risk companies that investors can buy. Not only did shares of under-$5 stocks perform worse than those over $100 during the 2020 market crash. Their volatility is consistently three times higher even in good times, according to data from Thomson Reuters.That makes market timing particularly essential for these low-priced stocks.Today, signs are emerging that the U.S. stock market is beginning to bottom out. Last Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the pace of rate hikes will slow “eventually.” And a relatively tight labor market shows that the U.S. might have avoided a deep recession this time around.It’s never easy to buy penny stocks at the bottom of the market. But concentrating on stocks with certain characteristics will help set investors up for a far better chance at penny stock success.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks. Read More: Penny Stocks — How to Profit Without Getting Scammed On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

239,11f60dbb-6e13-3b97-8ce6-d2cff8039539,NDAQ,2022-11-11,Advancing Sustainability and Transparency on the ESG Journey,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advancing-sustainability-transparency-esg-journey-143000359.html,1668090600,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 10, 2022 / The 2020s are shaping up to be a transformative era of impact. Increasingly, investors, markets, employees, and customers view environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices and priorities as being essential to a company's long-term success and viability. Companies that overlook the growing importance of ESG may leave themselves open to serious financial, operational, and reputational risks.""More than ever before, ESG is becoming central to corporate strategy,"" said Adena Friedman, president and CEO of Nasdaq. ""One of the primary factors is the realization that climate change and other social dynamics are now significant threats in a company's overall risk management strategy.""But ESG can be complex to navigate. Corporations, issuers, asset managers, and investors have different ESG requirements. Multiple standards and ratings organizations provide overlapping and sometimes conflicting information.Nasdaq's position at the nexus of all these market stakeholders gives us unique insights into the information and guidance that each group needs to be successful, no matter where they are in their ESG journey. We are uniquely positioned to help all market stakeholders with ESG in three critical ways:1. Empower corporations and issuers to help tell their ESG story.Our Nasdaq ESG Advisory Program helps companies at any stage of their ESG journey develop and streamline ESG strategies and disclosures.For companies that are in the early stages of their ESG strategy, Nasdaq provides guidance on which foundational metrics to disclose, as well as how to develop and share an ESG message.For those companies that have already made investments in ESG and developed a sustainability report, Nasdaq provides guidance on how to measure ROI / impact, how to integrate an ESG story into a broader investor narrative, and which disclosures to prioritize in order to gain recognition - and attract capital - as an ESG leader.Story continuesFor example, Etsy, a global marketplace for unique and creative goods, launched its Impact Strategy in 2017 featuring specific, measurable ESG goals. In 2020, Etsy's IR team worked with Nasdaq to benchmark the company's Impact/ESG reporting against best practices within the financial community. In doing so, Nasdaq provided Etsy with a deeper understanding of ESG ratings, index criteria, buy-side needs, and which sustainability factors can have the greatest impact on financial performance. Nasdaq also helped Etsy align its corporate efforts to the ESG ecosystem and develop an appropriate ESG-focused investor outreach strategy.Through its work with Nasdaq ESG Advisory Program, Etsy learned which reporting process (10-K) and framework (SASB or TCFD) investors preferred for receiving ESG information. Nasdaq offered additional ways in which Etsy could improve its ESG profile, such as making it easier for investors to find information on data privacy and security, supplier information, and labor management practices.Even companies like Etsy that have well-established ESG programs can benefit from Nasdaq's assistance in refining their disclosures, engagement strategies, and messaging so that investors are more likely to recognize and reward their ESG best practices.""The key is transparency,"" said Tomas Thyblad, vice president and head of European ESG Solutions at Nasdaq. ""When companies openly show they have a sustainable business strategy and have integrated sustainable ways of thinking throughout their business strategy, they have a greater likelihood of attracting capital from investors and being included in different ESG indexes.""Watch the clip hereESG data is valuable not only for investors seeking performance indicators, but also for public companies aiming to improve their operational efficiency, reduce their resource dependency, and attract both customers and employees.""ESG is about more than sustainability or social responsibility - it's really about measuring performance in a new way, using data to drive decision-making, and achieving a higher level of management excellence,"" said Evan Harvey, Global Head of Sustainability for Nasdaq.Nasdaq OneReport provides companies with an ESG reporting and workflow solution that streamlines the process of capturing and sharing ESG data. Nasdaq OneReport connects to more ESG raters and frameworks than any other system, making it easier for companies to capture ESG information, harmonize the data, and produce customized reports for a wide variety of ESG stakeholders.2. Improve transparency to help investors find new ESG investments and assess their existing portfoliosInvestment firms and asset managers are eager to invest in sustainable bonds and equities to fulfill mandates, attract ESG-minded investors, and achieve financial outperformance. Nasdaq can help by providing price discovery and intelligence on ESG bonds and other investable products, as well as portfolio optimization and ESG performance metrics.The Nasdaq Sustainable Debt Market helps these investors to obtain price discovery for green, social, and sustainability bonds, as well as sustainability-linked bonds. This Europe-based market gives issuers a venue in which to highlight and finance projects that will creative positives changes for communities, the climate, or the environment.53% year-over-year growth in listed volumes on the Nasdaq Sustainable Debt Market in 2020Looking beyond price discovery, the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network provides detailed information on sustainable bonds that helps investors perform due diligence, selection, and monitoring. In 2020, over 300 issuers joined the platform, including the Nordic Investment Bank, African Development Bank, IFC (a member of the World Bank Group), a number of major European banks, plus state and government agency issuers from Italy, Holland, and Mexico.Nasdaq has also announced a partnership with SGX (Singapore Exchange) to expand the platform into the Asian-Pacific region in 2021.""With the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network, we are trying to create a level playing field regardless of whether a bond issuer is based in the U.S., China, or Norway,"" said Ann-Charlotte Eliasson, Head of the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network. ""All the bond issues are presented in a similar way so that it's very easy for investors to get the information they need and make an informed decision instead of having to read innumerable reports.""Nasdaq offers two other solutions that help investors and asset managers with their ESG-related decision making. ESG Footprint combines data from 60 global sources with more than 40 filtering criteria (negative screens such as child labor or high GHG emissions, plus positive screens such as business ethics and green energy production) to produce an intuitive dashboard report that investors and asset managers can use to determine the real-world impacts of their overall investment holdings. ESG Footprint even makes recommendations on equities or bonds that investors and managers can add to their portfolio to better meet the sustainability goals of their stakeholders.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq ESG Data Portal provides a central database for objective and quantifiable ESG data from Nasdaq-listed companies. These firms release their data directly into the Portal, where Nasdaq then compiles and standardizes the ESG metrics so that firms can use the data for their own portfolios and processes.The Nasdaq ESG Data Portal is growing rapidly. The number of companies that provide data to the Portal has tripled from approximately 200 to 600 firms over the past 18 months.3. Provide dedicated ESG indexes and marketplaceNasdaq is accelerating the shift toward ESG investments by providing ESG indexes and a sustainable debt market that make it easier for buy-side players to fulfill their ESG strategies.Nasdaq creates and publishes ESG themed indexes such as the OMX Stockholm 30 ESG Responsible Index that buy-side players can use for benchmarking purposes and/or license for portfolio management.In 2018,Nasdaq also launched futures based on the OMXS30 ESG index - the first exchange-listed ESG index future in the world. Within a year of its launch, trading on the OMXS30 ESG future reached 1 million contracts and has more recently reached 2 million contracts. In the future, Friedman has said that Nasdaq expects to launch additional ESG-oriented indexes.Right now, buyers looking for sustainable debt issuances will find plenty of opportunities to make a positive impact in the Nasdaq Sustainable Debt Market. The issuers listing bonds at Nasdaq's Sustainable Debt Market in Europe collectively saved 9.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gas equivalents through the investments financed by their sustainable bonds, as reported by the issuers in their latest annual reports. These savings are equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions for the population of Stockholm.The Nasdaq Sustainable Debt Market accepts issues of four types of bonds:Sustainability Bonds are used to finance projects that bring clear environmental and socioeconomic benefits.Green Bonds are used to finance projects and activities that benefit the environment. Blue bonds that fund marine-related activities such as sustainable fisheries, marine conservation, and coastal protection are considered to be a sub-category of green bonds.Social Bonds are used to finance projects that achieve positive socioeconomic outcomes (with a neutral or positive impact on the environment).Sustainability-Linked Bonds are used to finance general corporate purposes, but with characteristics such as coupon rates that depend on the issuers' ability to meet certain sustainability targets.For example, in 2019, the Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) turned to Nasdaq's Nordic Sustainable Debt Market to issue an inaugural five-year Nordic-Baltic Blue Bond for SEK 2 billion. The next year, NIB followed that up with another five-year Nordic-Baltic Blue Bond for SEK 1.5 billion to finance water management and protection projects. Those blue bonds helped fund wastewater treatment in the Helsinki, Finland region to prevent pollution and protect fisheries in the Baltic Sea. See more about the project in this Nasdaq video.""If you invest in a green bond or a blue bond from the Nordic Investment Bank, you can steer your money into something that is environmentally friendly,"" said Angela Brusas, Director, Funding &amp; Investor Relations, Nordic Investment Bank. ""You can be sure that we will report in detail on the allocation, the projects financed, and the impact.""The massive capital inflows into ESG investments shows that markets and capital are working together to solve fundamental environmental and social problems.""At Nasdaq, our goal with all our ESG-related offerings is to bring corporations and investors together, help them make sense of a complex data landscape, and give them the clarity they need to make decisions that can help us all reach a more sustainable future,"" said Thyblad.Watch the clip hereNasdaq, Inc., Thursday, November 10, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725005/Advancing-Sustainability-and-Transparency-on-the-ESG-Journey]"

The company is facing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds which might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.Story continuesHowever, Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, MGIC Investment Corp. MTG and Radian Group RDN.Industry: Insurance - Multi-lineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2016864/5-multiline-insurers-to-watch-amid-high-inflation-and-rate-riseProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve the retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., MGIC Investment Corp. and Radian Group. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With five hikes in the interest rate this year so far and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al.The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified, which lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth for non-life insurance operations. Per Deloitte Insights,The Swiss Re Institute estimates an increase in demand for insurance coverage across the globe, in turn driving a 3.9% rise in premiums in 2022. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 4%, while non-life insurance premium is expected to increase 3.7% in 2022.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry would continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses in the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, an optimistic growth outlook and a solid capital level of the insurers, 2021 saw 869 deals, up 40% from 620 in 2020 while the total deal value surged 165% to $57.5 billion per Deloitte.However, with high inflation and rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made five rate hikes this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to calm down. Per Deloitte, so far this year, the number of deals dropped about 30% while deal value dropped by about 25% and estimated to hit a low point. Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has taken a leap in the industry with the pandemic hitting hard and companies gathering strength to operate amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs. Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population.At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. Per Deloitte Insights, the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term.

245,7988e6ec-e645-3645-9cde-1cc58a4aea5e,PRU,2022-11-11,"Investors fear liquidity crisis, military conflict, cyberattacks, PGIM tail-risk survey finds",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-fear-liquidity-crisis-military-141500290.html,1668089700,STORY,"['PRU', 'PRU.L']","[NEWARK, N.J., November 10, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Institutional investors still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic know the risks of unlikely but devastating ""black swan"" events, but many are ill-prepared for the ones they fear the most, according to a new survey from PGIM, the $1.2 trillion global investment management business of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU).This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221110005222/en/Shehriyar Antia, Head of Thematic Research, PGIM (Photo: Business Wire)The survey of 400 senior investment decision-makers at institutional investors in Australia, China, Germany, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. with combined assets under management of more than $12 trillion, found that while tail risks varied by region, the predominant concerns center around the relationship between the U.S. and China, market function in times of stress, and the dependence on technology within financial markets. While over half of large institutions ($50 billion and above) actively monitor tail risks, overall for institutions of any size, less than 4 in 10 do so (38%). A tiny proportion (3%) of institutions have a dedicated tail-risk manager, and less than a third (32%) prepare specific risk response plans.""Too often investors are surprised by things that in retrospect were staring them in the face,"" said Shehriyar Antia, head of Thematic Research for PGIM. ""The pandemic, the global financial crisis, the dot-com bubble — these events were all foreseeable to different degrees. Financial institutions must either gameplan for the unexpected, or expect to be blindsided.""THREE SCENARIOS THAT KEEP INVESTORS UP AT NIGHTPresented with geopolitical, economic, social and environmental scenarios ranging from a eurozone country debt default to a nuclear attack, respondents named their top three tail risks:An unexpected liquidity crunch in key capital markets (U.S. Treasuries, commodities, etc.) that results in a market crash. The tail-risk scenario seen as having the greatest market impact and one for which investors are least prepared is a major liquidity event in financial markets. A liquidity event in a ""safe haven"" like U.S. Treasuries would have cascading effects that neither capital providers nor investors would necessarily be prepared for.Military conflict in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea. A military conflict in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea would have stark ramifications for global financial markets, so it’s no surprise institutional investors cited such a conflict as their second-highest tail risk, and one they feel least prepared for. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, if Taiwan semiconductor production were to shut down for a year, the cost to annual revenue for device makers worldwide would be $490 billion.A cyberattack disables a major financial platform or government agency for a significant period of time. Only 30% of respondents said they are prepared for such a major cyberattack — despite this being seen as one of the most likely tail risks to occur over the next three years.Story continuesINVESTORS CAN DO MORE TO PREPARE FOR THE WORSTBy definition, tail risks are rare and unexpected, which makes them exceedingly difficult to prepare for. But there are ways investors can hedge their bets.Investors acknowledge a variety of gaps and shortcomings in their investment risk monitoring, chief of which are failure to detect risks early (36%) or react to them speedily (41%).More than a third also say they are unable to predict black swans (36%) and, worryingly, nearly 3 in 10 identify risk management complacency as a key challenge.Institutional investors deploy three main approaches to monitor investment risk: holistic monitoring across asset classes (44%), regular risk scenario analysis (41%) and regular evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management processes (41%).""The best insurance against such rare and complex events is taking a long-term view and diversifying portfolios,"" advised Antia. ""Active managers can build portfolio strategies that will protect investors in a variety of scenarios.""Monitoring leverage, collateral arrangements, and liquidity positions through these shocks can help investors avoid becoming a forced seller while the event is unfolding. When considering risks that are subject to extreme outcomes (and potentially not diversifiable), investors should also consider stress testing as opposed to looking at traditional statistical measures that make assumptions which may not be realistic for some exposures.For more information and country-specific data, read the full report: 2022 Global Risk Report: Tail Risks.ABOUT THE SURVEYThe study gathered the views of 400 institutional investors globally from defined benefit pension funds, corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, central banks, endowments and foundations. The online survey was conducted by CoreData Research between June and July 2022, along with eight qualitative interviews conducted globally across a similar mix of institution types. Investors evaluated possible tail risks according to likelihood, severity and preparedness.Respondents are aged 30-70 and have been in their current role for at least one year. Almost all (94%) investors are from firms with at least $1 billion in current AUM. A further 2% are from U.S. endowments and foundations with current AUM of at least $250 million. The study was blind with no mention of PGIM or Prudential. Respondents were offered an incentive to participate (a financial payment, charitable donation or tracked planting of trees).ABOUT PGIMPGIM is the global asset management business of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU), a leading global investment manager with nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management as of September 30, 2022.

While closing out the check, the servers can accept multiple forms of payment, including contactless and mobile wallets, or switch to guest pay mode and allow patrons to swipe, dip or tap their preferred payment card.With this technology, the staff will be able to focus solely on their guests’ comfort and experience instead of engaging themselves in taking orders or receiving payments. This saves valuable time for the staff and gives greater privacy to customers, hence improving their satisfaction and leading to higher return visits.The Oracle Micros Simphony helps restaurants manage everything from menu creation to payments with a single line of support and a centralized view of their revenues and credit card processing costs from the POS to their bank account. This increases efficiency and payment transparency.Oracle Cloud Expands in the Hospitality SectorWith the hospitality sector opening up and booming as the covid restrictions subside, Oracle has been making efforts to bring advancements in this sector to aid its top line.To help restaurants stay relevant and profitable in the given rapidly changing market and labor shortage issues, Oracle Cloud Marketplace has brought new integrations for MICROS Simphony POS. These new integrations include self-service kiosks, QR codes and AI, automated and tip gratuity distribution, and behavior-based marketing.In September, BurgerFi partnered with Oracle as it needed a restaurant point-of-sale system for its rapid expansion. Oracle implemented new technologies in the fast-service restaurant, such as customized tablets, contactless payments, tabletop, and kiosk ordering to enhance in-store dining. With all this, the chain has been able to easily scale its franchise to multiple locations and also improve operations, all while providing flawless interactions for customers.Story continuesOracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteBWH Hotel Group has also integrated its central reservation system with Oracle Hospitality OPERA Cloud property management system (PMS).

As modern servers pack more processing cores into CPUs, the memory bandwidth per CPU core has been decreasing. Micron DDR5 alleviates this bottleneck by providing higher bandwidth compared to previous generations, enabling increased reliability and scaling. The combination of 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors and Micron DDR5 delivers up to two times memory bandwidth on the STREAM benchmark and up to two times performance improvement on select HPC workloads such as computational fluid dynamics (OpenFOAM), Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling and CP2K molecular dynamics.“Micron continues to lead the industry transition to DDR5,” said Raj Hazra, senior vice president and general manager of Micron’s Compute and Networking Business Unit. “Algorithms that are increasingly memory-bound need far greater memory performance and reliability to extract insights from huge volumes of data. DDR5 provides the next significant advancement in system memory capabilities required to enable these algorithms, thereby continuing to advance the value of next generation data center infrastructure.”“4th Gen AMD EPYC processors continue to raise the bar for workload performance in the modern data center while simultaneously delivering exceptional energy efficiency. 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors will transform our customers’ data center operations by accelerating time to value, driving lower total cost of ownership, and helping enterprises to address their sustainability goals,” said Ram Peddibhotla, corporate vice president, EPYC product management, AMD.Micron compared the performance of the STREAM benchmark on a single 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor system populated with Micron DDR5 at 4800 MT/s to a 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processor system and Micron DDR4 at 3200 MT/s. With the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor system, Micron achieved a peak memory bandwidth of 378 GB/s per socket compared to 189 GB/s with 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processor system. This resulted in a two times increase in system memory bandwidth.Story continuesIn partnership with AMD, Micron evaluated three HPC workloads (OpenFOAM, WRF and CP2K) on 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with Micron DDR4 and 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors with Micron DDR5. The 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor platform with Micron DDR5 improved the performance of OpenFOAM by 2.4 times, WRF by 2.1 times and CP2K by 2.03 times.“The continued growth of modeling &amp; simulation, and machine learning workloads in HPC and AI means that our customers are demanding memory solutions that maximize effective bandwidth. Our collaboration with Micron throughout the development and validation phase, with these performance-intensive workloads in mind, allows us to deliver next-generation platforms with a new era in memory performance accelerated by DDR5,” said Scott Tease, vice president of HPC &amp; AI, Lenovo Infrastructure Solutions Group.Micron has played a pivotal role in JEDEC’s creation of DDR5 memory specifications and was one of the first to sample DDR5 to customers. Micron’s Technology Enablement Program (TEP), the first of its kind in the industry, gave system designers early access to key internal resources to assist their DDR5 validation and qualification processes.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon.A stock split is when a company increases its number of outstanding shares in an effort to boost its stock's liquidity and make it more affordable for investors. The underlying value of the business does not change, since the price of each share decreases in proportion to the increase in the number of outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 100,000 shares outstanding at a price of $10 per share, its market cap would be $1 million. If the company decides to go for a 2-for-1 stock split, the company will then have 200,000 shares outstanding at a price of $5 per share, and the market cap will stay the same at $1 million. Stock splits are usually carried out on a regular basis, such as every quarter or every year. They are often seen as a sign of a company's health and growth potential. Stock splits can also be beneficial for companies as they can repurchase their shares at a lower price. Typically, stock splits are indicative of a company's health and growth and are also indicative of management's confidence in their business.Mega Caps That Split In 2022Stock splits have been all the rage in 2022, with mega caps like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the way. On February 1, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced a 20-for-1 stock split, under which shareholders of record on July 1, received 19 additional shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) on July 15, 2022. On March 9, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) declared a 20-for-1 stock split for shareholders of record on May 27, payable on June 3, 2022. As of November 9, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at $88 per share. On August 4, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced that its board of directors has approved a 3-for-1 stock split for investors of record on August 17, 2022. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders received 2 additional shares per share on August 24, 2022.Story continuesA hawkish Fed is spooking investors away from the equities market, triggering major sell-offs. As of November 9, the S&amp;P 500 has sunk 20% year to date, the Dow has lost 10% since the beginning of the year, and the Nasdaq is down more than 30% for the year.

Some of the potential companies that may follow suit and announce a stock split soon include Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), Booking Holdings Inc.

(NYSE:NVR) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR): The US housing market has been unstable so far this year, as rising mortgage rates and higher housing prices have rapidly reduced affordability. Fortunately for existing homeowners, most of whom own their houses outright or have locked in low, fixed mortgage rates, rising rates have not directly impacted their finances unless they have an outstanding variable-rate home equity line of credit.Homebuilders, who rely on incremental demand for housing, have seen demand dry up in response to declining affordability. Single-family home building permits have plummeted in recent months back to pre-pandemic levels.That’s the bad news. On the bright side, the building materials supply chain, which delayed construction and increased the cost to build a home, is rapidly improving. This bodes well for homebuilders like NVR with a track record of cost discipline. In other words, even if NVR’s average selling price declines, it can maintain attractive gross margins if they simultaneously control costs…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

So this year's winners were the top, ""Masters of the Universe,"" and Lite-Brite, but there were a few on the nominee list that I liked a bit more. Now, my pick, the pinata. I'm like, how was that not a win? That's joy for everybody and candy. And you know, you get to hit things. That's fantastic.And then for those who love a bit of art, the Spirograph. It made you actually feel like you are good at art, even if you were trash like I was. But it gave me my confidence. I think they should have made it in there. What about you, Seana?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Rachelle, it's interesting. When you take a look at this, a lot of these toys are still popular today. The retro toys, we talked about nostalgia, so many people buying these types of toys during the pandemic and part of the reason why the companies couldn't stock the shelves fast enough.So I wasn't necessarily surprised by what entered the Hall of Fame this year, but Bingo, Pound Puppies, and Nerf were three things that I thought maybe should have been included and, I think, will likely be included at some point in the future, especially Bingo when you talk about the total sales of that game over the last several decades and the relevance today, the popularity of Bingo playing out in so many locations today. So it certainly makes a lot of sense.My favorite though was the American Girl Dolls, which was actually entered into the Hall of Fame last year, which I think makes a lot of sense. But I think it's hard to choose. There obviously are so many hit games out there. It's about time that top made it in. Maybe we'll see some of the ones that we personally like over the next couple of years.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, I did see that Nintendo's Gameboy had made it in there before as well, which makes sense, because a lot of the ways that they judged it, it wasn't just whether the toy was fun. It was things like confidence, like they talked about in ""Masters of the Universe,"" if you used to watch ""He-Man"" cartoons as a kid like I did, what it did for your confidence, to feel strong, to feel empowered.So they really take a holistic view when they look at some of these toys, which explains why American Girl Dolls made it in. You get to see yourself represented and with different kinds of hairstyles and clothing and culture. So I love the idea of this. And I'm a-- my daughter, she's only nine, but she's a big '80s kid. So she has a Lite-Brite. I try and make her play a lot of board games so I can live vicariously. And ""Operation"" is another really fantastic one.SEANA SMITH: Ooh, ""Operation."" I played that. I never had a Lite-Brite as a kid, but I hear it's a lot of fun. And certainly, it's popular. It's even popular today. People are still buying them, like you and like for your daughter.]"

The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$2.7m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Aon Aon Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Eric Andersen, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$283 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$296). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 5.7% of Eric Andersen's stake.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.3m for 4.60k shares. But they sold 9.65k shares for US$2.7m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Aon than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Aon Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Aon. We can see that insider Byron Spruell paid US$117k for shares in the company. No-one sold. This makes one think the business has some good points.Does Aon Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Aon insiders own 1.1% of the company, worth about US$702m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Aon Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchase is heartening. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. The high levels of insider ownership, and the recent buying by an insider suggests they are well aligned and optimistic. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Aon. At Simply Wall St, we've found that Aon has 3 warning signs (1 is significant!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Aon is working with clients to develop their own view of risk – an important component in achieving the differentiation necessary for successful renewals outcomes in the tightening reinsurance market.Over the past decade, Latin America experienced $64.4 billion in insured losses, predominantly driven by tropical hurricanes, followed by earthquake, drought and flooding. In response to these the challenges, the acquisition of ERN expands Aon's catastrophe modeling suite by introducing earthquake and hurricane modeling for Latin America and the Caribbean.The transaction sees ERN joining Aon's Reinsurance Solutions business, where it will collaborate with the Impact Forecasting team, whose modeling suite enables firms to analyze the financial impacts of catastrophic events with a view to developing effective reinsurance, underwriting and exposure management strategies.""The acquisition aligns within Aon's global position as a leader in data and analytics solutions for the re/insurance industry, our focus on catastrophe model development in Latin America, and our use of scientific research, academic collaborations and robust analytics to build innovative risk solutions for the public and private sectors,"" said Keith Lawler, managing director of Aon's Reinsurance Solutions in Latin America. ""We are excited to welcome the ERN team as we together pursue our shared commitment in helping our insurer clients to differentiate themselves, both in their understanding of how climate change and natural catastrophes affect their businesses, and in how they communicate this view of risk to their reinsurance carriers.""Story continuesFounded in 1996, ERN has developed modeling capabilities that are specific to Latin America and backed by strong expertise and research. Lawler will serve as CEO of this business and ERN founders Eduardo Reinoso and Dr. Mario Ordaz will join Aon as senior scientific advisors.""Throughout the last 26 years, ERN has built a highly respected brand and has utilized a broad range of modeling platforms that assist clients analyzing many risks,"" said Dr. Ordaz. ""Joining Aon can take us to the next level in terms of reach and delivery, contributing even more to reducing possible human and material losses from natural and man-made catastrophes.""The acquisition expands Aon's wider efforts to quantify natural catastrophes and climate risk globally. Aon is collaborating with leading academic institutions worldwide to better understand and apply evolving climate research, including, most recently, with the University of California, Merced and the University of California, Los Angeles to implement the latest climate change science and research into Aon's U.S. wildfire catastrophe model.Terms of the transaction, which has closed, were not disclosed.About AonAon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

(NYSE:PLD) stock gained 9.6% last week, insiders who sold US$7.8m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Selling at an average price of US$164, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Prologis Prologis Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Lead Independent Director, Irving Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.3m worth of shares at a price of US$165 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$118. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in Prologis than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Prologis insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$115m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Prologis Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Prologis insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Prologis (of which 2 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

260,fbff542d-174c-39fb-bae0-bf2b2170123e,PCAR,2022-11-11,PACCAR and Kulicke & Soffa have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-kulicke-soffa-highlighted-zacks-134301082.html,1668087781,STORY,"['PCAR', 'KLIC', 'LYFT', 'UBER']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 10, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares PACCAR PCAR as the Bull of the Day and Kulicke &amp; Soffa KLIC asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Lyft LYFT, Uber Technologies UBER and PayPal Holdings PYPL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:PACCAR is a $35 billion manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks for global markets and has substantial manufacturing exposure to light/medium trucks.It also designs and manufactures diesel engines and other powertrain components for use in its own products and for sale to third party manufacturers of trucks and buses. Besides supplying aftermarket parts, PACCAR also offers finance and leasing services.PACCAR Trucks distributes premium trucks under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates in the United States and Canada. The company operates in the European light/medium market under the DAF nameplate through its wholly owned subsidiary, Leyland, in the U.K.Strong Quarter Boosts EstimatesPACCAR's earnings of $2.21 per share for third-quarter 2022 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 and rocketed 109% from the year-ago figure. Higher-than-expected pretax income from Trucks, Parts and Financial Services segments resulted in the outperformance.Consolidated revenues (including trucks and financial services) came in at $7.059 billion, up from $5.146B recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. Sales from Trucks, Parts and Others were $6.687B, which marginally missed the consensus mark of $6.692B.Responding to this strength, analysts raised this year's consensus from EPS of $7.73 to $8.15, based primarily on the big quarter beat.What's more important is that they boosted next year's EPS consensus from $8.04 to $8.36.Key Quarter TakeawaysRevenues from the Trucks segment totaled $5.198B in the September quarter, higher than the prior-year quarter’s $3.453B. The figure, however, missed the consensus mark of $5.313B. The segment’s pre-tax income was $430.5 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $385 million and increasing a whopping 438% year over year.Story continuesRevenues from the Parts segment totaled $1.472B in the reported quarter, increasing from the year-earlier period’s $1.260B and surpassing the consensus mark of $1.431B. The segment’s pre-tax income came in at $374 million, up 32.6% on a yearly basis. The metric also outpaced the consensus mark of $353 million.Revenues of the Financial Services segment declined to $372 million from the year-earlier quarter’s $409 million but came in line with the consensus estimate. Pre-tax income rose to $146 million from $120 million and came higher than the consensus mark of $142 million.Drivers of GrowthThe reasons that have PCAR pushing over 21% topline growth this year to cross $26 billion -- and stunning 53% EPS growth -- are the combination of rising commodity prices, demand for vehicles, and robust economic activity globally.While the stock sits near 52-week highs, it's still quite the value, trading at only 1.3 times sales. And the P/E sits comfortably under 13X.And as they complete over 5 years of partnership with NVIDIA in autonomous driving systems and intelligent logistics, PACCAR is poised to remain a leader in transportation across the globe.Bear of the Day:Kulicke &amp; Soffa is a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and electronic assembly solutions supporting the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing and industrial segments.As a pioneer in the semiconductor space, K&amp;S has provided customers with market leading packaging solutions for decades. In recent years, K&amp;S has expanded its product offerings through strategic acquisitions and organic development, adding advanced packaging, electronics assembly, wedge bonding and a broader range of expendable tools to its core offerings.Combined with its extensive expertise in process technology and focus on development, K&amp;S is well positioned to help customers meet the challenges of packaging and assembling the next-generation of electronic devices.Ahead of EarningsThe market expects Kulicke and Soffa to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022.This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 16. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.The semiconductor equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -58.1%.Revenues are expected to be $280 million, down 42.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kulicke and Soffa?For Kulicke and Soffa, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kulicke and Soffa will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Kulicke and Soffa would post earnings of $1.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.09, delivering a surprise of +34.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom line on KLIC: The stock trades at only 1X sales, but the financial metrics are headed south. Best to stay away until the global dust clears.Additional content:Why Lyft Plunged -23% Despite Q3 Earnings BeatShares of Lyft have plummeted 22.91% since Nov 7 despite better-than-expected earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) being reported for third-quarter 2022 on the said date. Quarterly earnings also improved on a year-over-year basis. The massive decline may be due to the lower-than-expected revenues reported by this ride-hailing company for the September quarter. Weakness pertaining to rider volumes also disappointed investors.Earnings Report in DetailLyft’s third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding $1.29 from non-recurring items) of 11 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents and our estimate of 10 cents. In the year-ago period, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player reported earnings of 5 cents per share.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Total revenues of $1053.8 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1054.7 million and our estimate of $1,056.7 million. However, the top line jumped 21.91% year over year on a 7.2% increase in active riders, which totaled 20.31 million in the reported quarter.However, the number of active riders in the quarter was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20.94 million. Also, year-over-year growth recorded in the September quarter was lower than the 15.9% year-over-year growth registered in the June quarter. Moreover, active riders increased only marginally (2%) sequentially. Another factor about active riders that might have disappointed investors is that the third-quarter 2022 figure was below the 22.3 million active riders in the third quarter of 2019 (pre-coronavirus era). This San-Francisco-based company’s revenue per active rider increased 13.7% year over year in the September quarter to $51.88.Lyft’s adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $66.2 million, above our estimate of $58 million but lower than the year-ago figure of $67.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 6.3% compared with 7.8% in the year-ago period.Total costs and expenses climbed 25.7% year over year to $1.34 billion in the quarter. Contribution improved 14.9% year over year to $590.4 million. Contribution margin decreased to 56% from 59.4% in the year-ago period. Lyft exited the third quarter with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.8 billion, flat sequentially.Q4 OutlookFor the December quarter, management expects revenues in the band of $1.145-$1.165 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.16 billion. Our estimate is currently pegged at $1.13 billion. Management expects fourth-quarter revenues to grow 9-11% from the previous quarter’s reading and 18-20% from the year-ago reported figure. Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the $80-$100 million range. Adjusted EBITDA margin is anticipated in the 7-9% range.Following are a few other Q3 reports from the Zacks Computer and Technology industry:Uber Technologies incurred a loss of 61 cents per share in the third quarter of 2022, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents. In third-quarter 2021, Uber delivered earnings of 23 cents per share.Total revenues of $8,343 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,076.5 million. The top line jumped 72% year over year, backed by contribution from the acquisition of Transplace by Uber Freight and a change in the business model for Uber’s UK Mobility business. In the reported quarter, most of (60%) UBER’s revenues came from Mobility. Revenues from this segment jumped 73% year over year to $3,822 million.PayPal Holdings reported adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share for third-quarter 2022, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.7%. However, the figure declined 2% on a year-over-year basis. Net revenues of $6.85 billion exhibited year-over-year growth of 12% on an FX-neutral basis and 11% on a reported basis. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion.Growing transaction and other value-added services’ revenues drove the top line year over year in the reported quarter. Also, accelerating U.S. and international revenues contributed handsomely.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

262,852e1693-d319-3046-81a3-2a5e911a27fb,AXP,2022-11-11,Selling US$14m worth of stock earlier this year was a lucrative decision for American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) insiders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-14m-worth-stock-120055212.html,1668168055,STORY,['AXP'],"[American Express Company's (NYSE:AXP) stock rose 11% last week, but insiders who sold US$14m worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Selling at an average price of US$180, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, sold US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$155. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of American Express shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).American Express Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that American Express insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. insider Walter Clayton spent US$149k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$133m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At American Express Tell Us?The recent insider purchase is heartening. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The high levels of insider ownership, and the recent buying by an insider suggests they are well aligned and optimistic. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

We're building on our progress in reducing our end-to-end carbon footprint and working toward our long-term goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In doing so, we're transforming how we do business across our entire supply chain - from farmer's field to shop shelf.""For the last several years, we've worked with the Science Based Targets initiative to reduce our emissions footprint and with our net zero target, we are accelerating our efforts to create a more sustainable snacking company.

As part of the goal, we have signed the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi's) Business Ambition for 1.5°C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation targets with the aim of limiting temperature rise in accordance with the Paris Agreement. We've also joined the United Nations Race to Zero Campaign to help build momentum towards a decarbonized economy.Defining Net Zero CarbonThe SBTi Net-Zero Standard defines corporate net-zero carbon as: • Reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions to zero or to a residual level that is consistent with reaching net-zero emissions at the global or sector level in eligible 1.5°C-aligned pathways • Neutralizing any residual emissions at the net-zero target year and any GHG emissions released into the atmosphere thereafter.Story continuesA Clear Way ForwardAchieving net zero is no easy task, but we have set a clear path and know what we have to do to steer toward our long-term goal.Our principles for transition:1.

That's why we take an end-to-end approach to reducing our carbon footprint so we can work to reduce emissions within our owned operations and also, importantly, work to reduce emissions through signature programs designed to achieve more sustainable sourcing of the key raw materials we know have the biggest impact on our overall carbon footprint.Mondelēz International's Carbon FootprintWe have been monitoring and implementing programing to decrease emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 for several years, enabling us to gain experience in setting up long-term and more ambitious carbon reduction programs and related metrices and goals as well as the processes and governance required.We have also been calculating our Scope 3 emissions for several years and, as a next step as part of joining the SBTi Race to Net Zero are currently working with our external carbon experts and partners on a planned model revision allowing us to incorporate our Scope 3 interventions into the carbon model, review the materiality of recent acquisitions as well as incorporate planned updates to carbon accounting standards and recommendations set by the SBTi and the GHG Protocol, both targeting to enhance clarity around Scope 3 definitions.~70% of Mondelēz International's CO2e emissions comes from our raw materials, concentrated in four key commodities so more sustainable sourcing of these key raw materials will have biggest impact in reducing our overall carbon footprint.We have been implementing programs to reduce Scope 3 emissions that we are currently in the process of translating into carbon emissions reductions. We are focused on scaling signature sourcing programs in Cocoa and Wheat where thirdparty verified impact data gives us confidence to confirm our programs have a direct impact on emission reductions. For more information on the impact of our signature sourcing programs on a forest positive future please see page 53 .We're working with our suppliers and farmers to grow ingredients in ways that protect forests and promote biodiversity globally with tens of thousands of suppliers, and hundreds of thousands of farmers.Assessing Our Carbon FootprintWe take a thorough approach following the internationally recognized GHG Protocol Standards to calculate, annually, our total carbon footprint across our end-to-end supply chain, covering Scopes 1, 2 and 3.We assess the following activities:Scope 1 emissions:Combustion of fuels in our owned and operated facilitiesCombustion of fuels in our owned and operated mobile sourcesFugitive emissions from our owned and operated manufacturing sitesScope 2 emissions:Indirect emissions associated with purchased electricity, heat and steam in Mondelēz-owned and operated facilitiesScope 3 emissions :Purchased goods and services (including effects of Direct Land Use Change)Fuel and energy related activitiesUpstream transportation and distributionWaste generated in operationsBusiness travelEmployee commutingDownstream transportation and distributionUse of sold productsEnd of life treatment of sold productsFocusing End-to-EndWe look at each individual step within our supply chain to understand the contributors to our carbon footprint and where our focus matters most.2025 Goal-10%Our goal is to achieve 10% end-to-end CO2e emissions reductions by 2025 (vs 2018).Our AmbitionWe are in the process of adjusting our path towards net zero, which is subject to verification by the SBTi (by 2023 latest). In the meantime, we continue to deliver against our 2025 public goals, including reducing our absolute end-to-end greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by 2025 vs a 2018 baseline, which is equivalent to a 23% reduction vs business-as-usual.Following the SBTi guidelines, we focus our carbon reduction programs on the categories of GHG emissions that are most impactful for Mondelēz International. This represented 20.3 million metric tonnes CO₂e in 2020 (or 83% of our total value chain GHG emissions footprint). Accordingly, we include the following GHG emissions in our goal setting: Scope 1, Scope 2 and major elements of Scope 3: purchased goods and services and waste generated in operations.In 2021, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by 21% versus our 2018 baseline by continuing to improve energy efficiency and increase our use of renewable energy.We have been implementing programs to reduce Scope 3 emissions that we are currently in the process of translating into carbon emissions reductions.Energy ProgressElectricity and natural gas energy sources are the largest contributor to our manufacturing footprint and so are a major focus of our carbon reduction efforts.We continuously invest in energy management systems and energy efficient technologies in our factories. We are also using low-carbon renewable energy sources to reduce our CO2e emissions.Improving Energy EfficiencyIn 2021, several energy efficiency projects were implemented across our manufacturing network. Here are some examples:In South Africa, our Port Elizabeth site installed four centralized chiller units, saving 380 MWh per year in refrigeration, reducing CO2e by 2240 metric tonnes.Meanwhile in Poland, our Skarbimierz plant optimized its refrigeration system with the installation of dry coolers as a free cooling loop, reducing the workhours of the chillers and in so doing cutting out 1,300 metric tonnes of CO2e.Our East Suzhou plant, in China, is using the 200°C air emitted by its ovens to heat water and generate savings across the refrigeration process and other systems - saving 334 metric tonnes of CO2e.Read more in the Mondelēz 2021 Snacking Made Right ReportMondelēz International, Thursday, November 10, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mondelēz International on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Mondelēz InternationalWebsite: https://www.mondelezinternational.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Mondelēz InternationalView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725017/Mondelz-2021-Snacking-Made-Right-Report-Climate-Action]"

Market participants remained concerned as no clear cut picture has appeared so far about which party will take control of the U.S. Congress as the midterm election results were too close to call. Weak earnings results also dented investors’ sentiment. Additionally, market participants are waiting for a key inflation data. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 posted their worst post-election day decline in a decade. Nasdaq Composite registered its worst post-election day drop in line with 2012.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 2% or 646.89 points to close at 32,513.94. Notably, 29 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory while one in green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 10,353.17, tumbling 2.5% or 263.02 points due to weak performance of large-cap technology stocks.The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.1% to end at 3,748.57. All 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in negative territory. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XKY) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) plunged 1.6%, 1.7%, 2.6%, 3.1% and 4.9%, respectively.The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 2.2% to 26.09. A total of 11.6 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.8 billion. The S&amp;P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 16 new 52-week lows. The Nasdaq Composite registered 69 new 52-week highs and 463 new 52-week lows.Uncertain Midterm Election ResultsThe results of the U.S. Congressional midterm election is yet to deliver any decisive verdict. So far, the Republicans have an edge in both the House of Representatives and Senate. However, a red-wave expected by election watchers is yet to be visible. At present, democrats control the House of Representative and have a slender edge in the Senate.Story continuesWall Street generally likes a split Congress. Currently, the United States is having democrat President. A Republican controlled House or Senate or both is likely to create a stalemate regarding future government spending. Lower or no government spending may result into reduced inflation and interest rates.Markets Wait for CPI DataThe consumer price index (CPI) for the month of October will be released on Nov 10, before the opening bell. Market participants remained nervous before the release of this data as it may determine whether the Fed will continue with its aggressive interest rate hike policies or will reduce the magnitude of rate hike. October’s CPI data may also indicate whether the terminal interest rate will go beyond 5% and by how much. Investors are expecting the CPI to decline a little bit although it will stay elevated.Weak Q3 2022 Earnings DataThe Walt Disney Co. DIS reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings of $0.30 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 40% and declining 18.9% year over year. Revenues increased 8.7% year over year to $20.15 billion but lagged the consensus mark by 4.50%.Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY reported third-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.44 per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48. Earnings in the third quarter were lower than our estimate of $2.83 per share. However, total revenues were $9,501 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,354 million.Consequently, shares of The Walt Disney and Occidental Petroleum tanked 13.2% and 9.2%, respectively.

We believe firmly that there is importance and significance in representation.”ABC 57 reported that the company has been a part of Project Impact, an initiative in South Bend providing resources to support minority-owned businesses. Luten said he depends on such support to help the company reach its goals, which include scaling up to a new 4,200-square-foot facility.“We want to be able to open and expand more opportunity to our communities and to engage minority entrepreneurs and expand the opportunity,” said James Summers a volunteer executive director of Project Impact.“Our entire goal behind Importin’ Joe’s is to change the trajectory of children who are at risk and children who are homeless so our goal is to cultivate a community that can eventually accommodate 15,000 or more from children and women in Ethiopia, while simultaneously equipping our current ecosystem in our community here as well,” said Luten.Future plans for the company include supporting the local community, giving back to their roots, and working to expand to more than 60 locations across Indiana and Southwest Michigan by the spring.]"

Earnings were up 23.1% year over year.Total revenues in the reported quarter rose 12% year over year to $940.7 million. Total revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $939.9 million. The upside was driven by sales of new drugs and drugs added from the acquisition of GW Pharmaceuticals.Net product sales increased 12.2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $935.8 million. Royalties and contract revenues were up 26.3% to $4.9 million in the quarter.Neuroscience ProductsSales of Jazz’s neuroscience products increased 10.1% to $711.4 million.Net product sales for the combined oxybate business (Xyrem + Xywav) increased 11% to $512 million in the quarter. During the quarter, average active oxybate patients rose 10% year over year to approximately 17,600.Sales of the sleep disorder drug Xyrem declined 16.7% year over year to $256 million due to patients switching to Xywav. Jazz expects an authorized generic version of Xyrem to be launched in late 2022 or January 2023, which should hurt sales.Xywav, a low-sodium formulation of Xyrem, recorded sales of $255.9 million in the quarter, up 67.2% year over year and 8.9% sequentially. The upside can be attributed to the encouraging uptake of the drug in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) indications. As of October 2022-end, Jazz achieved a new significant milestone. There are now more narcolepsy patients taking Xywav than those taking Xyrem.Sales of the epilepsy drug Epidiolex/Epidyolex rose 22% to $196.2 million. The drug was added to Jazz’s pipeline with the GW Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition in 2021. Jazz is making significant progress related to the launch of Epidyolex in Europe and other ex-U.S. markets.During the quarter, JAZZ initiated a pivotal late-stage study on Epidiolex to support its label expansion to include epilepsy patients with myoclonic-atonic seizures.

275,5f199624-63eb-3318-97f4-fcc461de6f35,VRTX,2022-11-11,"AstraZeneca's (AZN) Q3 Earnings Beat, EPS Growth View Up",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/astrazenecas-azn-q3-earnings-beat-152003806.html,1668093603,STORY,"['AZN.L', 'AZN', 'VRTX', 'BAYN.DE', 'MRK']","[AstraZeneca’s AZN third-quarter 2022 core earnings of 84 cents per American depositary share (ADS) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents. Core earnings of $1.67 per share rose 55% year over year on a reported basis and 70% at constant exchange rates (CER).Total revenues were $10.98 million, up 11% on a reported basis and 19% at CER in the quarter, driven by higher product sales. Revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Product Sales RiseProduct sales rose 16% at CER to $10.59 billion. Collaboration revenues were $392 million, almost tripling from the year-ago quarter levels.Among AstraZeneca’s various therapeutic areas, Oncology product sales were up 22%. CVRM product sales were up 19%, while the Respiratory &amp; Immunology segment gained 1%. Vaccines &amp; Immune Therapies sales declined 21%. Rare disease product sales were up 11%. Sales of other medicines rose 30%.Sales of Some Key DrugsIn Oncology, Lynparza product revenues rose 19% year over year to $659 million, owing to growth in use in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers in the United States as well as the launch in early breast cancer in the country in March. Increased use in first-line HRD-positive ovarian cancer and increased uptake for expanded label in breast cancer boosted sales in Europe.AstraZeneca markets Lynparza in partnership with Merck MRK. The profit-sharing deal between AstraZeneca and Merck was inked in 2017. In addition to Lynparza, the deal included Koselugo.AstraZeneca &amp; Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, namely ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indications as well as some other cancer types.Tagrisso recorded sales of $1.4 billion, up 20% year over year on strong demand as a first-line and adjuvant treatment. Increased use of Tagrisso for the first-line setting in China and continued growth in other Emerging Markets offset the negative impact of the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) price reduction in China.Story continuesImfinzi generated sales of $737 million in the quarter, up 26% year over year, driven by increased demand for ES-SCLC indication. AstraZeneca witnessed some recovery in lung cancer diagnosis rates, mainly in the United States and Europe.Calquence generated sales of $566 million in the quarter, up 63% year over year, benefiting from the increased new patient market share.Sales of AstraZeneca’s legacy cancer drugs, such as Iressa, Faslodex, Arimidex and Casodex declined during the quarter. However, sales of Zoladex rose in the quarter.In CVRM, Brilinta/Brilique sales were $338 million in the reported quarter, down 7% year over year, primarily due to the slower post-pandemic recovery of oral antiplatelet medicines like Brilinta in the United States and the EU and pricing pressure from the VBP (volume-based procurement) program in China.Farxiga recorded product sales of $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 50% year over year, reflecting volume growth across all regions and growth of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in general. The label expansion approvals for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease indications contributed to Farxiga’s sales growth in the United States and Europe. In Emerging markets, Farxiga is witnessing growth in ex-China Emerging Markets.In Respiratory &amp; Immunology, Symbicort sales declined 1% in the quarter to $630 million. Pulmicort sales declined 31% to $145 million.Fasenra recorded sales of $353 million in the quarter, up 15% year over year, driven by increased market share performance in Europe and the United States due to market leadership. However, sales are being hurt somewhat due to price erosion in Japan.AstraZeneca’s new triple combo COPD treatment Breztri recorded sales of $103 million in the quarter compared with $93 million in the previous quarter.New lupus drug, Saphnelo (anifrolumab) recorded sales of $33 million in the quarter, compared with $24 million in the previous quarter.In the Rare Disease portfolio, which was added following the Alexion acquisition in July 2021, Soliris recorded sales of $901 million, down 6% year over year due to conversion to Ultomiris. Ultomiris and Strensiq sales were $518 million and $237 million, up 47 and 20%, respectively.In Other Medicines, sales of Nexium rose 36% to $311 million.In Vaccines &amp; Immune Therapies, AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria, generated $173 million of revenues, much less than $451 million in the previous quarter due to the conclusion of many initial contracts. No revenues were recorded in the U.S. market in the second and third quarters of 2022.AZN’s COVID-19 antibody cocktail medicine Evusheld generated $537 million in sales, compared with $445 million in the previous quarter.Profit DiscussionAstraZeneca’s core gross margin of 80.8% was up 7 percentage points at CER as the dilutive effect from profit-sharing arrangements and increased pricing pressure in China was offset by a positive mix due to increased contribution from oncology and rare disease medicines. Core selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16% to $3.16 billion.Core research and development expenses rose 16% to $2.36 billion. Core operating profit rose 63% to $3.41 billion in the quarter. The core operating margin was 31.1% in the quarter, up 9% year over year.2022 GuidanceAstraZeneca expects total revenues to increase in the low twenties percentage in 2022, same as the previous expectations.Core earnings are expected to increase in the high twenties to low thirties percentage versus the previous expectation of the mid-to-high twenties percentage in 2022.Foreign exchange is expected to have a mid-single-digit percentage adverse impact on total revenues and a mid-to-high single-digit adverse impact on core EPS in 2022 (previously mid-single-digit).Our TakeAstraZeneca’s third-quarter results were encouraging as it beat estimates for earnings while sales came in line with the consensus mark. Product sales growth was driven by higher sales of key medicines across Oncology and CVRM units like Tagrisso and Farxiga, which offset lower sales of some key older medicines like Brilinta and Symbicort. Higher collaboration revenues also boosted the top line.AstraZeneca maintained its sales growth guidance for 2022 while raising its earnings growth expectations.AstraZeneca’s stock was up 3.9% in pre-market trading on Thursday in response to the better-than-expected results and earnings guidance raise.The stock has risen 4.9% this year so far compared with an increase of 4.2% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAstraZeneca is making rapid progress across its pipeline.

282,b1713464-1077-3332-9284-a66acb8e0b4c,GE,2022-11-11,Positive week for General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) institutional investors who lost 20% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-general-electric-company-130025585.html,1668171625,STORY,['GE'],"[A look at the shareholders of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 69% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 20% losses, last week’s 8.9% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about General Electric. View our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that General Electric does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see General Electric's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. General Electric is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.8% and 6.3% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of General Electric Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$228m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand General Electric better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Progressive Progressive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$126 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$130. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's holding.Progressive insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Progressive Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Progressive. In total, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan sold US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Progressive insiders own about US$238m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Progressive that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

However, a prudent investor knows that in times like this, one should choose stocks that provide sustainable returns. To this end, we recommend stocks like Arch Resources, Titan Machinery, PBF Energy, Valero Energy and Axcelis Technologies, which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Story continuesAnalyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the third-quarter earnings cycle almost in its last lap, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen.Arch Resources: It is one of the largest coal producers in the United States, operating nine mines across the major coal basins of the country.

The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and throughputs.Specifically, the refining margin of $30.21 per barrel improved significantly from $14.51 a year ago. Total refined product sales volumes were 3,587 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from 3,539 mbpd in the year-ago quarter.

290,09e24ae8-e276-3a9a-ae55-70a76ce5fd9c,VLO,2022-11-11,5 Low Leverage Stocks to Buy Amid Market-Wide Skepticism,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-leverage-stocks-buy-122312700.html,1668082992,STORY,"['PBF', 'ARCH', 'VLO', 'ACLS', 'TITN']","[U.S. stocks slid on Nov 9, with investors being skeptical about election results and inflation pressure.Against this backdrop, an investor might not feel encouraged to buy some stocks. However, a prudent investor knows that in times like this, one should choose stocks that provide sustainable returns. To this end, we recommend stocks like Arch Resources ARCH, Titan Machinery TITN, PBF Energy PBF, Valero Energy VLO and Axcelis Technologies ACLS, which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityStory continuesThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the third-quarter earnings cycle almost in its last lap, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen.Arch Resources: It is one of the largest coal producers in the United States, operating nine mines across the major coal basins of the country.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. As per Bank of America, a new bull market could emerge in 2023 after the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates in 2022 in a bid to control inflation. While most investors are focused on the Fed's continuous rate hikes, they fail to observe that the central bank is shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet by means of monthly roll-offs of its treasury and mortgage debt worth $95 billion. Paired with rising rates, this move will make the global market illiquid, which can trigger a reversal in the Fed’s policy making next year. BofA's investment strategist Michael Hartnett said that central banks are ""petrified of market consequences of liquidity withdrawal.” The US dollar climbing new highs is another signal that the Fed could potentially press pause on its fiscal tightening. Any shift from the Fed, whether it chooses to halt future interest rate hikes or continues its monthly balance sheet reductions, could be a positive indicator for investors and result in a significant rally. However, Hartnett observed that the market will experience more pain before a relief rally in 2023, and he expects that stocks will touch record lows soon. As stocks hurtle towards new lows, investors are taking this opportunity to pile into high-quality firms which would normally be trading at much higher multiples. Case in point, Hartnett observed on October 21 that equities experienced in flows of more than $9 billion in the past week. Some of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023 include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services for individual customers, small and mid-sized businesses, institutional investors, large enterprises, and governments worldwide. It is one of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s dividend yield on November 11 came in at 2.31%. JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) to $39 from $35.50 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares. The large cap banks are benefitting in terms of revenue from higher rates and benign credit quality, while some impact from recession was already priced into the shares, the analyst told investors in a research note. In the short-term, he thinks bank stocks ""should continue to benefit from rotation away from other sectors seeing more headwinds.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) was part of 99 hedge fund portfolios, with collective stakes worth about $36 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Apple Inc.

As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:10 Stocks That Will Make You RichGoldman Sachs Semiconductor StocksBest Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 13 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 130% in five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 13%. But the price may well have benefitted from a buoyant market, since stocks have gained 9.2% in the last thirty days.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Automatic Data Processing achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Automatic Data Processing has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Automatic Data Processing will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Automatic Data Processing's TSR for the last 5 years was 155%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Automatic Data Processing shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 21% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. As per Bank of America, a new bull market could emerge in 2023 after the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates in 2022 in a bid to control inflation. While most investors are focused on the Fed's continuous rate hikes, they fail to observe that the central bank is shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet by means of monthly roll-offs of its treasury and mortgage debt worth $95 billion. Paired with rising rates, this move will make the global market illiquid, which can trigger a reversal in the Fed’s policy making next year. BofA's investment strategist Michael Hartnett said that central banks are ""petrified of market consequences of liquidity withdrawal.” The US dollar climbing new highs is another signal that the Fed could potentially press pause on its fiscal tightening. Any shift from the Fed, whether it chooses to halt future interest rate hikes or continues its monthly balance sheet reductions, could be a positive indicator for investors and result in a significant rally. However, Hartnett observed that the market will experience more pain before a relief rally in 2023, and he expects that stocks will touch record lows soon. As stocks hurtle towards new lows, investors are taking this opportunity to pile into high-quality firms which would normally be trading at much higher multiples. Case in point, Hartnett observed on October 21 that equities experienced in flows of more than $9 billion in the past week. Some of the best American stocks to buy heading into 2023 include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our Methodology We selected the following American stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong market visibility.

Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial.

Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:10 Stocks That Will Make You RichGoldman Sachs Semiconductor StocksBest Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 13 Best American Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Hosted out of Manila and simulcast to more than 10 countries and 3400 participants, the signature event saw the roll out of clinical guidance on simple diagnostic procedure for peripheral neuropathy and sharing of clinical experiences by medical experts.(PRNewsfoto/P&amp;G)With Diabetes Mellitus being the leading cause[1] of peripheral neuropathy (PN), the increasing prevalence of PN is closely linked to the rise in the number of diabetic patients. PN including Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is the result of damage to the nerves impacting quality of life of people as they are not able to go about their daily lives as comfortably. Burning and stabbing pain in the feet and hands can have a significant impact on the activities of daily living, including walking, climbing stairs, and sleeping. Peripheral neuropathy is often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed due to a lack of awareness amongst both patients and physicians[2]. Besides diabetes mellitus, B vitamins deficiencies and aging are other high-risk factors leading to peripheral nerve damage.Dr Ashley Barlow, Senior Director, Medical &amp; Technical Affairs, P&amp;G Health (Asia Pacific, India, Middle East, and Africa) shared, ""As a partner to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), P&amp;G Health is committed to continued efforts to raise awareness on Diabetes and its associated complications including Peripheral Neuropathy and Nerve Damage. The 'Winning the Fight Against Neuropathy in Diabetic Patients' forum is the first of several scientific forums being rolled out by P&amp;G Health as part of our World Diabetes Day awareness efforts across Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa region, to highlight the connection between Peripheral Neuropathy and Diabetes and the importance of early identification and timely treatment.""Story continues(PRNewsfoto/P&amp;G)Speaking at the forum, Dr. Rayaz A. Malik (Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, Consultant Physician at Central Manchester University Teaching Hospital) shared, ""Peripheral neuropathy is highly underdiagnosed in South-East Asia and the Middle East due to a lack of consensus guidance on routine screening and diagnostic pathways. This has a major impact on the quality of life as a result of painful neuropathic symptoms, foot ulceration and amputation with an associated 5-year mortality of 40% and 80%, respectively.  An awareness and sense of urgency amongst patients and healthcare providers is required, and primary care physicians need simple tools and guidance to help them diagnose peripheral neuropathy.""The P&amp;G Health 'Winning the Fight Against Neuropathy in Diabetic Patients' forum brought to light enriching insights, data and clinical practice guidelines from health experts from across the globe and the region on the important role of neuropathy diagnoses, treatment and management, in improving the quality of life of diabetic patients,"" added Dr. Ashley Barlow.""While identifying a patient with early onset PN may sound challenging, it is not and doesn't require complex diagnostic tools to diagnose peripheral neuropathy. Simple tools like a questionnaire and a sensory test can be a good start. By asking the right questions and listening to the patient, we can help patients avoid severe complications and improve their quality of life. The primary care physician has a key role to play in this,"" added Dr. Rayaz A Malik.For more information on the 'Winning the Fight Against Neuropathy in Diabetic Patients' forum, click here to register and learn from the webinar as healthcare professional: WDDglobalwebinarFAST FACTSIn 2021, there were 393 million diabetic patients in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and African regions projected to rise to 603 million by 2045[3].1 in 2 patients with diabetes and suffer from Peripheral Neuropathy[4] during their lifetime. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes there will be an exponential growth in the number of patients in these regions with PN.There are also at least as many people with pre-diabetes as there are with diabetes and at least 10% suffer from PN[5].A study from the Philippines in 2000 from the Diabcare-Asia project, which assessed 2,708 patients in diabetes centres, reported a prevalence of 42% for diabetic neuropathy, based on medical records[6].&lt; 1/3rd of physicians recognize signs of DPN. Undiagnosed cases contributing greatly to the high rates of morbidity and mortality of diabetes[3]. Up to 50 % of patients are asymptomatic and therefore often remain undiagnosed and are at risk of insensate injury[7].If not diagnosed and treated early, DPN can manifest with neuropathic pain with a tremendous impact on the quality of life.About P&amp;G Health: P&amp;G Health, the health care division of P&amp;G company, drives consumer-centric innovation to empower our consumers to live healthier, and more vibrant lives.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +9.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has gained 9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 points to a change of +0.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.23 indicates a change of +6.9% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for P&amp;G.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.51 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -2.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $79.39 billion and $82.52 billion estimates indicate -1% and +3.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. EPS of $1.57 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.77%. The EPS surprise was +1.29%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the same time period, operating costs surged 126% to €4.98 billion, due to a 205% increase in fuel expenses to €1 billion.Average fares in the first half of fiscal 2023 were up 7% from the corresponding pre-COVID level.

The new guidance indicates a 13% growth from the pre-COVID traffic numbers. Management expects profit after tax in fiscal 2023 in a range of €1 billion to €1.20 billion. The guidance is dependent on RYAAY not experiencing any adverse events this winter. In fact, management has warned that recovery for the remainder of fiscal 2023 may be impacted by new Covid variants or adverse geopolitical events.RYAAY was also in the news recently, when it reported upbeat traffic results for October. The story was reported in detail in the last week’s write-up.2. In October, Gol Linhas’ consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 2.9 percentage points to 81.4% with traffic growth (40.9%) lagging the capacity expansion of 46% year over year. The upbeat traffic in its domestic markets is leading to a rosy scenario on a consolidated basis. In October, domestic traffic and capacity improved 30.2% and 26%, respectively. On the domestic front, 26% more passengers boarded GOL’s flights in October 2022. Domestic load factor was 81.6%. The volume of departures and seats on the domestic front increased 30.9% and 31.1%, respectively.

To expand its network, Frontier Airlines reportedly announced new routes serving Phoenix and Dallas-Fort Worth. Last Friday, Frontier launched its base at Phoenix. Following the launch, the carrier is operating daily flights connecting Phoenix with Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Detroit and Orange County, California. Frontier will operate flights to Cincinnati four times a week.ULCC also aims to expand its presence in Dallas-Fort Worth this spring.4. With Nicole strengthening from a tropical storm to a hurricane, American Airlines has decided to waive change fees for flights connected to 20 airports in Florida, Georgia, the Bahamas and Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Due to hurricane Nicole, multiple flights connecting the Charlotte Douglas international airport and the airports mainly in Florida and Georgia were cancelled. This is causing untold harassment to passengers and deals a blow to airlines, already suffering labor woes.PerformanceEven though most airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the losses were muted in nature.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for American Airlines Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.00031 = US$14m ÷ (US$67b - US$22b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, American Airlines Group has an ROCE of 0.03%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Airlines industry average of 6.1%. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group roceIn the above chart we have measured American Airlines Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is American Airlines Group's ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at American Airlines Group doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 0.03% from 14% five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesOur Take On American Airlines Group's ROCEWhile returns have fallen for American Airlines Group in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. However, despite the promising trends, the stock has fallen 70% over the last five years, so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. So we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the trends look encouraging.American Airlines Group does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 2 which are concerning)  we think you should know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon.A stock split is when a company increases its number of outstanding shares in an effort to boost its stock's liquidity and make it more affordable for investors. The underlying value of the business does not change, since the price of each share decreases in proportion to the increase in the number of outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 100,000 shares outstanding at a price of $10 per share, its market cap would be $1 million. If the company decides to go for a 2-for-1 stock split, the company will then have 200,000 shares outstanding at a price of $5 per share, and the market cap will stay the same at $1 million. Stock splits are usually carried out on a regular basis, such as every quarter or every year. They are often seen as a sign of a company's health and growth potential. Stock splits can also be beneficial for companies as they can repurchase their shares at a lower price. Typically, stock splits are indicative of a company's health and growth and are also indicative of management's confidence in their business.Mega Caps That Split In 2022Stock splits have been all the rage in 2022, with mega caps like Amazon.com, Inc.

Fortunately for existing homeowners, most of whom own their houses outright or have locked in low, fixed mortgage rates, rising rates have not directly impacted their finances unless they have an outstanding variable-rate home equity line of credit.Homebuilders, who rely on incremental demand for housing, have seen demand dry up in response to declining affordability. Single-family home building permits have plummeted in recent months back to pre-pandemic levels.That’s the bad news. On the bright side, the building materials supply chain, which delayed construction and increased the cost to build a home, is rapidly improving. This bodes well for homebuilders like NVR with a track record of cost discipline. In other words, even if NVR’s average selling price declines, it can maintain attractive gross margins if they simultaneously control costs…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Brandon Fisher and Dan Ouwenga from Eaton's eMobility business address the top 10 consumer concerns related to electric vehicles.BRANDON FISHER: Hello. Welcome to the 10 in 10 podcast. Electric vehicles are a hot topic with automotive buyers today. However, some consumers have concerns before making the transition to EVs. I'm Brandon Fisher, head of engineering for our eMobility, power distribution, and protection product lines.DAN OUWENGA: And I'm Dan Ouwenga, senior manager of power electronics technical strategy for eMobility here with another Eaton 10 in 10 podcast. Engineer to engineer, we're going to be discussing 10 consumer misconceptions related to electric vehicles. Brandon, we've got 10 minutes and 10 questions. So let's get started.To start off, one of the major factors that concern vehicle owners is related to range. What can you tell us about the battery range of EVs compared to gas or diesel vehicles?BRANDON FISHER: Thanks, Dan. Most electric vehicles have over 200 miles of range today. Some even have options up to 300 miles of range. There's also a difference in how we use these electric vehicles. So we charge these electric vehicles at home, and I leave each day with a full battery charge, so that gives me over 200 miles a day.Additionally, most users are driving vehicles roughly 50 miles a day. So that leaves plenty of battery for you to do your daily commute, return home, and charge for the next day.DAN OUWENGA: Will charging availability become an issue for EV owners as adoption increases?BRANDON FISHER: As I mentioned, with electric vehicles, we'll change the use in how we charge. So instead of driving to fuel, we'll actually do more of charging where we're parked. And so you don't actually have to go out of your way to fill up an EV.Story continuesIn fact, most cars are parked 95% of the time. So whether you're at work, at home, at a shopping center, you can be charging these vehicles. And then, of course, when we have longer-distance trips, there are DC fast charges that are placed strategically along major highways for charging for long road trips. In fact, Eaton is working on a line of chargers, from smart chargers for your garage to DC fast chargers that would go along the highway or in parking lots.DAN OUWENGA: Are there enough charging stations to support the growing number of EVs on the road?BRANDON FISHER: The number of EV chargers available today is really strong enough to meet the current demand, and it continues to grow. So as of 2021, there were over 1.6 million public and commercial charging stations on the ground globally. That number is going to grow rapidly over the next few years to over 9 million charging stations in 2028.When you add this to the fact that most people charge at home, and additionally, you've got workplaces and shopping centers adding charging centers, charging stations aren't going to be a problem for the adoption of electric vehicles.DAN OUWENGA: Great. So next question is, will the electric grid be able to handle the influx of EVs?BRANDON FISHER: The reliability of the electric power grid is definitely meeting the demand today. And the development of smart charging and bidirectional charging will actually make electric vehicles be advantageous to the grid. So as technology advances, EVs will become a dynamic part of the grid and not just an endpoint or a load on the grid.Eaton is working with utility companies and building manufacturers to provide solutions that really enable more flexibility into the grid. And like I said, you'll be charging your electric vehicles, and there may be some scenarios where electric vehicles are actually generating energy or dumping energy back into the grid for some of the peak load situations today.In addition, a lot of these vehicles are being charged at home, as I mentioned. And that enables them to be charged at night, when the grid is very lightly used.DAN OUWENGA: And my final question for you is, are EVs as affordable as gas or diesel options?BRANDON FISHER: Great question. So automakers are definitely responding to the demand for more affordable EV options with several makes and models that are really already comparable in price to their gas or diesel counterparts. In addition to that, first-time EV buyers can also offset some of that cost with state and federal tax credits that are still available.And the other thing that you need to think about is in the long-term, these electric vehicles have a more affordable cost of ownership. The maintenance on them is very low. And so drivers are not being held hostage by fuel prices, for example. Electricity prices are very stable and much less than the equivalent full tank of gas.In addition, fewer tuneups, fewer moving parts are on board these electric vehicles. And so what that means is essentially, it's new tires. It's windshield wiper fluid and brakes, but at a far less consumption rate than your gas vehicle.Thanks, Dan. Now I'm going to ask you a few. Many consumers associate EVs as a greener alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles. Is this really true?DAN OUWENGA: Let's start with the obvious. EVs have no tailpipe emissions, which automatically make them better for the local environment than gas or diesel-powered vehicles. For example, in the winter, I warm up my EV in the garage with the garage door shut. That's not really advisable with a gas or diesel car.Then we're looking at the bigger picture for CO2. Even if your electricity comes from a coal power plant, it has lower greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable new gas or diesel vehicle. Electric vehicles are just incredibly efficient.If you're curious about the impact of driving an EV in your community, there's an online tool called Beyond the Tailpipe Emissions Calculator developed by the EPA and Department of Energy that allows you to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with charging and driving your EV where you live.BRANDON FISHER: Some vehicle owners feel disposing of EV batteries could become a sustainability issue. Should we be concerned about EV batteries filling up landfills?DAN OUWENGA: The batteries in electric vehicles are highly engineered to last a long time, typically 10 to 15 years and 1,000 to 1,500 cycles, in some cases much more. For example, a battery with a 300-mile range and a 1,500 cycle rating would mean 450,000 miles of use.Plus, there's a lot of development that continues to increase that cycle life rating of the battery. We could even see batteries outlasting the vehicles they're put in. Today, many automotive companies already offer battery warranties of greater than 100,000 miles. And once batteries are no longer useful in vehicles, they can have a second life used as energy storage for things like solar panels, backup power for homes or businesses, and many other things.And finally, for the complete end of life, there's battery recycling, which right now is getting a big investment from the industry. Some recycling companies are already claiming to recover 95% of the valuable materials.BRANDON FISHER: Should EV owners be concerned about running out of power if they get stuck in traffic?DAN OUWENGA: When your EV isn't moving, your electric motor doesn't use any power. So the heating and cooling system uses energy directly from the battery. You don't need to have an engine idling, like an internal combustion engine car, to have heating or cooling.With the small amount of energy used for heating or cooling and relatively large batteries in modern EVs, some people use their EVs for camping and can sleep with the cabin at a comfortable temperature all night and still have plenty of battery left in the morning. So the short answer is you'll have plenty of power to sit in traffic for a lot longer than you'd like to sit in traffic.BRANDON FISHER: Excellent. What about the topic of safety? Are EVs safe to drive?DAN OUWENGA: EVs need to go through the same crash safety testing as gas or diesel-powered vehicles. And in many cases, the EVs have very high safety scores. Some of the safest vehicles on the road are actually EVs.There's a few reasons for this. First is the batteries on the bottom of the car, which lowers the center of gravity reducing the chance of rollover. Second, since there isn't an internal combustion engine up front, the crumple zones can be optimized for even better occupant safety. And for EVs, there's also an additional focus on battery safety. While you might have seen some high-profile EV fires reported in the news, electric vehicles actually catch on fire at a significantly lower rate than gas or diesel-powered vehicles.Eaton works very closely with automotive companies around battery pack safety. One of our products called Breaktor can quickly shut down the battery pack within milliseconds in the event of a collision or short-circuit.BRANDON FISHER: OK, Dan. I have one last question for you. Does driving an EV mean sacrificing speed or performance?DAN OUWENGA: On the contrary, modern EVs are now getting a reputation for high performance. There are some EVs which are quicker than the latest gasoline or hybrid supercars. Plus, when you want to have a little fun without drawing any unwanted attention, EVs are quiet, even when accelerating quickly.Anyone interested in performance vehicles should at least test drive one of these modern EVs. You won't be disappointed.BRANDON FISHER: Thank you for the discussion today, Dan.

At the same time, these firms incur losses as the value of longer-duration bonds goes down with rising interest rates. Nevertheless, since insurance companies have long-term investment horizons, they can hold investments until maturity, and hence, no actual losses will be realized (read: 5 ETFs Set to Benefit From Higher Rates).A slew of solid earnings from the leading players in the insurance industry added to the strength as some of the prominent players surpassed estimates for both earnings and revenues. This will pave the way for a further rally in insurance ETFs like SPDR S&amp;P Insurance ETF KIE and iShares U.S. Insurance ETF IAK. Both ETFs have gained in double digits over the past month.Insurance Earnings in FocusMetLife MET, the U.S. life insurance behemoth, reported earnings of $1.21 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and declined 49% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 38.7% year over year to $23.69 billion and breezed past the consensus estimate of $19.9 billion.Prudential Financial PRU, the second-largest U.S. life insurer, missed on earnings but beat on revenue estimates. Earnings per share of $2.13 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 and decreased 43.6% from the year-ago earnings. Revenues increased 10% year over year to $21.61 billion and edged past the consensus mark of $12.76 billion.One of the leading property and casualty insurers, Chubb Corp CB, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share by 15 cents and for revenues by $391 million. Earnings per share improved 20.1% year over year. Another property and casualty insurer, Allstate ALL, came up with a loss per share of $1.56, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.57. The company reported earnings of 73 cents in the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 8.1% year over year to $13.37 billion, well above the consensus mark of $12.69 billion.Earnings per share of $1.42 reported by Aflac AFL, a seller of supplement health insurance, trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 19.6% from the year-ago earnings. Revenues dropped 8% year over year to $4.82 billion and beat the consensus mark by 4.4% (see: all the Financial ETFs here).Personal property and casualty insurer Travelers TRV posted earnings per share of $2.20, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 43 cents but declining 15.4% from the year-ago earnings.

The portfolio comprises a three-mile estimated population of 95,000 with an average household income of $187,000 and is 94.4% leased.The eight high-quality shopping centers comprise five grocery-anchored centers with a strong collection of necessity-based tenants and retailers that offer everyday goods and services. This is likely to enhance Kimco’s portfolio, a large portion of which includes grocery-anchored centers. As of third-quarter 2022 end, this segment generated 81% of Kimco’s annual base rent.Kimco funded the purchase through the issuance of a combination of cash and redeemable units and the assumption of a 4.1% mortgage debt of $88.8 million, having a remaining term of around six years.Per Conor Flynn, CEO of KIM, “The acquisition also brings us closer to our target of 85% of the company’s annual base rent coming from grocery anchored centers.”Kimco has been following an opportunistic investment policy to enhance its overall portfolio quality. It has been divesting its joint venture assets that have maximized their value and utilizing the proceeds to fund acquisitions and development and redevelopment projects.  During the third quarter, this retail REIT acquired two grocery-anchored centers for $89 million in aggregate. The centers are located in the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia and Massapequa, NY, and encompass 329,000 square feet.Further, its strong balance-sheet position supports its expansionary efforts. KIM exited the third quarter of 2022 with nearly $2.0 billion of immediate liquidity. This included $1.9 billion of availability under its $2-billion unsecured revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents of $124 million.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been revised marginally upward over the past week to $1.58.Shares of Kimco have lost 9.2% in the past three months compared with the industry's decline of 9.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Sherwin-Williams has been relatively sluggish. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Sherwin-Williams.Is There Enough Growth For Sherwin-Williams?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Sherwin-Williams' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered virtually the same number to the company's bottom line as the year before. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 49% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its uninspiring short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 14% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.4% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Sherwin-Williams is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Sherwin-Williams' P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that Sherwin-Williams maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Don't forget that there may be other risks.

The 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA was also trimmed down by management.Q3 UpdatePediatrix reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24.5%.

QuoteTotal operating expenses increased 1.9% year over year to $442.5 million due to a 22% escalation in practice supplies and other operating expenses, a 4.3% uptick in practice salaries and benefits and a 9.9% rise in depreciation and amortization expenses. Yet, the figure came lower than our estimate of $453.2 million.General and administrative expenses of $57.9 million dropped 13.5% year over year in the third quarter, courtesy of cost savings resulting from net staffing reductions, a decline in incentive compensation expense and lower revenue cycle management expenses.Interest expense plunged 45.9% year over year to $9.5 million, attributable to a declining debt level and reduced interest rates from the refinancing transactions of Pediatrix closed in the first quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA of $58.3 million tumbled 20.6% year over year in the quarter under review and fell short of our estimate of $72.2 million.Financial Update (as of Sep 30, 2022)Pediatrix exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $8.7 million, which declined nearly 45-fold from the 2021-end figure.Story continuesTotal assets of nearly $2,332 million decreased 14.3% from the figure at 2021 end.Net debt, including finance leases, amounted to $745.9 million, down 25.8% from the level as of Dec 31, 2021.Total equity of $858.7 million slipped 4.2% from the 2021-end level.During the first nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities more than doubled the prior-year comparable period’s level to $68.3 million.Pediatrix had a leftover borrowing capacity of $95 million as part of its revolving credit facility at the third-quarter end.2022 ViewManagement anticipates adjusted EBITDA within $240-$245 million, down from the prior view of $260-$270 million. The midpoint of the revised guidance suggests an 8.7% decline from the 2021 figure.Annual interest expense is forecast between $38.5 million and $39 million, up from the previous outlook of $36-$38 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $35 million in 2022, up from the prior expectation of $34 million. Transformational and restructuring-related expenses are predicted at $10.3 million, higher than the prior projection of $9.3 million.Earlier, MD had anticipated revenues of $2 billion this year, indicating a 4.7% increase from the 2021 reported figure.Zacks RankPediatrix currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Medical Sector ReleasesOf the Medical sector players that have reported third-quarter results so far, the bottom-line results of Universal Health Services, Inc.

319,9359040e-d018-353f-94fa-3020023a0073,AWK,2022-11-11,7 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy When the Fed Is Hawkish,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-no-brainer-stocks-buy-174254539.html,1667842974,STORY,"['ALL-PG', 'FIVE', 'AWK', 'DUK', 'KMI', 'KR']","[With the Federal Reserve raising the benchmark interest rate again, it’s time for investors to target no-brainer stocks to buy that may perform well during a period of monetary tightening. While this ecosystem closes many doors in the equities sector, a few well-positioned firms should do remarkably well.Mainly, it’s important not to overthink the fundamental value of these no-brainer stocks to buy. With the Fed sending interest rates to a 14-year high, previous investment paradigms will shift. Rather than growth-driven ideas, Wall Street will likely value companies that benefit from inelastic demand. By this, I’m referring to enterprises that will enjoy relatively consistent demand irrespective of economic pressures. Thus, whatever people need the most in life is what investors should target.Below are some of the most compelling no-brainer stocks to buy with the Fed going hawkish.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKRKroger$46.47FIVEFive Below$149.53DUKDuke Energy$90.61AWKAmerican Water Works$135.93KMIKinder Morgan$18.25ALLAllstate$128.59AFLAFLAC$67.56Kroger (KR)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Kroger (NYSE:KR) operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the U.S. Presently, the company sports a market capitalization of $33.2 billion. On a year-to-date basis, KR is up less than 3%. However, considering that the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is down over 21% during the same period, Kroger looks like a winner.Certainly, Kroger makes a fundamental case for no-brainer stocks to buy amid monetary tightening. Obviously, no matter what the Fed does, households must put food on the table. To be fair, demand won’t be completely inelastic as budget tightening will mean slimmer grocery purchases. However, humans must consume a baseline minimum amount of calories. That should help Kroger stay comfortably afloat during these times.In addition, it’s also important to remember the trade-down effect. Even if the economy slips into a deep recession, consumers will at first trade down from nights out at fancy restaurants to drive-thrus at fast-food joints. Failing that, the next trade-down will be to the grocers. In other words, Kroger is favorably the last in line, making it one of the no-brainer stocks to buy.Story continuesFive Below (FIVE)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is a chain of specialty discount stores that sells products that are less than $5. Also, it sells a selection of products ranging from $6 to $25. Presently, the company features a market cap of $8.3 billion. Since the start of the year, FIVE is down 28%. However, in the trailing month, it’s up 3%.Over the past several weeks, I’ve been talking about Five Below frequently because it’s one of the no-brainer stocks to buy. Staying with the trade-down theme, most consumers won’t go from A (premium retailers) to Z (literal dollar-discount stores) immediately. Instead, I anticipate a transition will occur. And Five Below provides a classier take on the discount retail theme, thus attracting bargain hunters.Also, the company brings great value from a fiscal perspective. According to data from Gurufocus.com, Five Below features outstanding income-related performance metrics relative to the industry. Also, decent stability in the balance sheet undergirds FIVE, making it one of the no-brainer stocks to buy.Duke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBased in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is an electric power and natural gas holding company. At the moment, Duke features a market cap of just over $69 billion. Since the beginning of the year, shares slipped around 10%. In the trailing month, DUK is about half a percent below parity, indicating some movement among the bulls.Fundamentally, Duke Energy represents one of the no-brainer stocks to buy based on economic realities and migration patterns. First, no matter what happens in the economy, households will do whatever it takes to keep the lights on. Plus, being tied to a digitalized society, and losing access to power simply represents an unacceptable conundrum.Second, Duke benefits from millennial migration trends. With so many young people being priced out of the wild real estate market – particularly in the coastal metropolitan areas – they’re looking for regions with lower costs of living. Duke just happens to service many of these regions, making it an attractive long-term idea among no-brainer stocks to buy.American Water Works (AWK)a picture of waterSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Camden, New Jersey, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) through its subsidiaries provides water and wastewater services. It offers water and wastewater services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states serving a population of approximately 14 million through 3.4 million customer connections.Currently, AWK carries a market cap of $24.7 billion. Since the start of the year, AWK lost more than 24% of its equity value, which is admittedly distracting. However, in the trailing month, shares gained over 4%. Probably, as more people recognize that the Fed isn’t messing around with its rate hikes, folks will come around to AWK.Basically, the narrative aligns with Duke. Water services practically represent a human right. Therefore, it’s the last expense to be traded down precisely because no alternative exists. And while AWK could use some shoring up of its balance sheet, the underlying business does enjoy strong income-related performance metrics.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is one of the largest energy infrastructure firms in North America. Per its public profile, Kinder specializes in owning and controlling oil and gas pipelines and terminals. Currently, the company carries a market cap of $40.8 billion. Since the start of the year, KMI gained over 11% of its equity value.Fundamentally, as a midstream player, Kinder benefits from established demand flows. For instance, upstream players (exploration and production) may lose out big to a lack of exploration and production. On the downstream end, certain brands may not be as competitive as others. However, the broader hydrocarbon space always needs storage and transportation solutions, which afford KMI better income predictability.Sure enough, the financials undergirding Kinder provide much confidence in terms of income-related stability. For instance, the company’s revenue growth rate ranks among the industry’s top half. The same can be said about its profitability margins, making KMI a prudent idea among no-brainer stocks to buy.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBased in Illinois, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is one of the largest insurance companies in the U.S. Currently, Allstate commands a market cap of $34 billion. Since the beginning of this year, ALL gained a little over 9%. In any other circumstance, this wouldn’t be anything to write home about. But again, with the benchmark index down more than 20%, a 9% gain represents a massive victory.Further, additional gains may be on the horizon, making ALL a worthy candidate among no-brainer stocks to buy. Generally speaking, insurance stocks tend to rise during periods of higher interest rates. More importantly, companies like Allstate benefit from inelastic demand. No matter what, people need a baseline of financial protection. Allstate provides exactly that.Beyond this point, auto insurance providers – which Allstate is one of – benefit from a hostage audience. Most states in the Union require basic auto insurance coverage. Therefore, look to Allstate to help you navigate the Fed’s monetary tightening.Aflac (AFL)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Columbus, Georgia, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) is an insurance specialist. Specifically, Aflac represents the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the U.S., per its corporate profile. Presently, the company features a market cap of $42.63 billion. Since the Jan. opener, AFL gained a whopping 15.3%. Not bad for a “boring” company and investors may look forward to even greater gains.If the coronavirus pandemic taught us anything, it’s that no matter how advanced we become as a society, if the forces that govern the universe decide it’s time for our little corner of the galaxy to have some smelly stuff hit the proverbial fan, there’s nothing we can do about it. Well, nothing except having some supplemental insurance for the times when “regular” insurance doesn’t cover the underlying event.As with other insurance players, Aflac will likely benefit from a higher interest rate environment. Obviously, you can see it in the chart itself. Thus, it’s one of the no-brainer stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

325,30cfc4d1-c22a-3cd5-8c00-eb911bad203b,PEP,2022-11-11,Investing in PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) five years ago would have delivered you a 83% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-pepsico-nasdaq-pep-five-120046761.html,1668168046,STORY,['PEP'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the PepsiCo share price has climbed 58% in five years, easily topping the market return of 46% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 15% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, PepsiCo achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that PepsiCo has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think PepsiCo will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for PepsiCo the TSR over the last 5 years was 83%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that PepsiCo has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 15% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PepsiCo better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with PepsiCo , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: PepsiCo may not be the best stock to buy.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion, recommending the approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In September 2022, Dupixent was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis.Prurigo nodularis is a chronic, debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient's quality of life among inflammatory skin diseases, due to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience intense, persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful – with burning, stinging and tingling of the skin – and can negatively affect mental health, activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials, PRIME and PRIME2, showing Dupixent significantly reduced itch (the primary endpoint) and skin lesions compared to placebo. Dupixent also significantly improved health-related quality of life while reducing measures of skin pain and symptoms of anxiety/depression. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included conjunctivitis.Story continuesThe use of Dupixent in adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), as well as investigational diseases prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, prurigo nodularis, asthma, CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in the EU and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing.

In September, the company told its employees it would wind down the partnership, and subsequently pulled all of the Yeezy Gap products from the shelves.The company is continuing to search for a CEO since the sudden departure of Sonia Syngal in July. She has been succeeded on an interim basis by Bob Martin, executive chairman of the board.The $16.7 billion Gap Inc. has had a sustained inability to pull itself out of the doldrums. Its three biggest brands — Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic — have all been faltering for some time, though Old Navy only in the last few seasons after a series of missteps over sizing and fashion miscues.Banana Republic, though still experiencing declining sales as of late, since the fall has exhibited more stylish and appealing collections harking back to the brand’s safari-style roots.There have been concerns over Gap Inc.’s inventory levels and costs, though the firm’s pack-and-hold strategy and lower inventory purchases this year as well as some lower costs because of the discontinuation of air transport of merchandise should help Gap’s financial results going forward.The combination of macroeconomic issues and persistent internal issues dragged Gap into the red during the second quarter ended July 30, when the group lost $49 million, compared to a profit of $258 million in the year-ago quarter. Net sales of $3.86 billion were down 8 percent compared to last year’s $4.2 billion. Comparable sales were down 10 percent year-over-year.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks. Jason Brady, president and CEO of Thornburg Investment Management, joined CNBC’s ‘The Exchange’ on November 8, where he noted that growth stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are now trading in value territory after losing billions in market capitalization this year alone. He contended that although the future of Meta hinges upon the ROI from its hefty metaverse investment, it is still a cash flow positive operation in terms of core business categories. However, he warned investors to be careful when viewing every beaten down stock as a buying opportunity, to save themselves from value traps. In the beginning of November, value stocks posted large gains compared to their growth counterparts. The Russell 1000 Value index climbed 10.1% in October, outperforming its growth peers by 4.3%. Similarly, The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) saw inflows of $444 million last month during the rally. Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, told CNBC on November 3: “We continue to prefer value over growth, with growth in the middle of a perfect storm of higher rates + weakening fundamentals. Value factors have also historically benefitted from year-end seasonality.”Some of the best value stocks in the Goldman Sachs portfolio include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 value stocks from the Goldman Sachs portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to Goldman Sachs’ stake value in each holding.

(NYSE:HD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”9.

Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy.

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the top value stocks in the Goldman Sachs portfolio. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industry wide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Value Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:12 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy NowTop 10 Real Estate Stocks To Buy13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to see more cheap ESG stocks, go directly to 5 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now.ESG investing is investing in a way that considers environmental, social, and governance issues. The term is often interchangeably used with 'sustainable investing' or 'socially responsible investing'.In terms of the environmental issues, investors consider whether a company helps conserve and protect the natural environment. In terms of social issues, investors consider whether a company has good relationships with employees, customers, and communities. Finally in terms of the governance aspect, investors consider whether a company has standards for company leadership and offer risk controls.ESG investing is a big trend on Wall Street.According to PwC, ""Asset managers globally are expected to increase their ESG-related assets under management (AuM) to US$33.9tn by 2026, from US$18.4tn in 2021. With a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.9%, ESG assets are on pace to constitute 21.5% of total global AuM in less than 5 years.""2022Given investors focus on areas that don't necessarily generate the highest returns, ESG investing might not match the broader market return, especially if their fees are higher than the average.Nevertheless, there are some ESG stocks that trade for attractive valuations given the market decline in 2022.With the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts think the U.S. central bank will increase rates even further.As a result of the substantial interest rate increases, the broader market indexes have declined signficantly in 2022 and some stocks trade for relatively low valuations that make them cheap.If economic data doesn't meet expectations, there could still be more downside in the near to medium terms. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesSergey Nivens/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now, we took 10 stocks with a forward P/E of under 15 that were among Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)'s top 33 holdings as of 11/8/2022 in terms of % of the fund.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 10 based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022.10 Cheap ESG Stocks to Buy Now10.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform.

The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 start-ups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.In this blog, we highlight Afriagrimark, winner of the 2022 Global Problem Solver Challenge People's Choice Award worth $10,000 USD. Voted as a winner by the public, Afriagrimark's mission is to revolutionize the agricultural pathway from farmer to supplier to vendor in Kenya.Founder Bonface Nyalwal and his team have a passion for finding real solutions to real problems. They start with the challenges that their community faces and ask questions to get to the root of the issue. With this exploration, they have built a platform to revolutionize the most pressing issues facing small-scale farmers in Africa - reliably and with-scale getting goods to market.What problem is your technology solution trying to solve?Bonface: Across Africa, there are 33 million small-scale farmers without a market with competitive prices. They must sell to middlemen who undercut their prices while making better margins themselves. This situation keeps the farmers below the poverty line. Afriagrimark aims to provide better access to competitive markets for farmers, suppliers, and vendors.Can you explain how the solution works?Bonface: The technology has three segments:Farmer's moduleDriver's moduleVendor's moduleThese three segments create a clear line from farmers to logistics to vendors. Among the farmers, we have recruited local agents trained to understand the quality assurance process and technology usage to train those adopting the solution. These agents help farmers sign up on the platform, list their produce, and provide ongoing support so that they can deploy best practices for farming and post-handling. Once produce is listed, the vendors who buy on-platform in urban markets can place their orders online. Afriagrimark's internal staff is notified of incoming orders, verifies them, and aggregates the net amount of produce needed from farmers to fulfill the order. The aggregation takes place so that the order amount is economically viable for the farmer to ship out. Next, the closest driver gets a notification and the agent on the ground brings the aggregated amount to them. The driver completes an additional round of quality inspection, and then signs off to begin shipment. This action sends a notification to all three parties - farmer, driver, and vendor - and can track order progress. The driver then delivers to each vendor who has placed an order.Story continuesWhat is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?Bonface: We have identified the need to rethink the value of small-scale farmers across Africa. Migrating the traditional marketplace and bringing it into a digital platform is the basis of our innovation. Unless we change the system so that small-scale farmers can produce enough value to participate in the market, their economic conditions will not improve. Our technology uses a geodatabase to map farmers so we know exactly where they are located; with this, we can track how many farmers are in which areas and what volume they are producing of which goods. This way, our operations cut the cost of the middleman who overcharges the farmer. Over time, we hope to embed machine learning in addition to GIS to efficiently track data and synchronize it across parties. Our future innovation lies in data.What inspired you to develop this solution?Bonface: My passion for agriculture stems from my family. My mother, who lived in an urban area, was a vegetable vendor, and my father, who lived in a rural area, was a teacher and farmer. Their most common complaints were around the quality and volume of goods at the market. When I was young, I did not quite understand what they meant. Over time, I realized that my father was not producing a high enough volume of high-quality goods to economically justify moving his yield to my mother who would take it to market.As my team and I spoke to other farmers and vendors, we understood exactly which points along the supply chain cause the most avoidable issues. Understanding the root of the problem, I decided to build a digital platform for farmers like my father to sell quality produce at sufficient, economically justifiable volumes to produce vendors.How will winning a prize in the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge help you advance your business?Bonface: My team's bigger dream is to build a wider infrastructure in Africa. We seek to pay attention to the global community's problems and customize our solutions. Working on the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge from trainings to pitching helped us refine what our business looks like in a customer context.Agriculture is a huge market that requires partnerships and collaborations, and now Cisco plays a part in that journey. We must rebuild the foundation required to propel the agricultural sector into an efficient and ethical future. This can only be accomplished if more and more companies come together to support this vision for small-scale businesses.Do you know what you will use the prize money for specifically?Bonface: The first thing we seek is to onboard more vendors onto the platform. With more vendors, we will be able to support more farmers on the platform. Second, we will work to build our internal capacity and continue to build a well-informed, equipped team that can support scale.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Bonface: It is very important to really, truly find what the problem is. Sometimes, we say that something is a problem via assumptions, and that problem may not actually exist. Ask people and find out what their real problems are - do not address just the symptoms, but rather the cause of the disease.As social entrepreneurs, we also need to understand that every market has its own, unique context. For example, in the case of Afriagrimark, Africa has a unique marketplace and customers. You have to train the customers accordingly to have the knowledge base to support your products upfront. We cannot assume that a market will immediately learn and deploy; we need to help the market understand and adopt your product.Lastly, to founders, discipline is the hardest part of the journey. Always focus on the ‘why' and on the community you are serving. Stay in the game no matter how hard it is and build a team that can take the dream further.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724995/Afriagrimark-How-Small-Scale-Farmers-in-Africa-Get-Goods-to-Market-Through-a-Unique-Platform]"
