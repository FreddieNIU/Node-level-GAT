Best oil stocks to buySource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comCrescent Point Energy (NYSE:CPG) is an oil and gas company based in Canada. In 2022, it minimized its capital expenditures, which strengthened its balance sheet. The company increased its base dividend. In addition, it returned around $500 million to its shareholders by paying dividends and buying back stock.For 2023, Crescent Point targets a cash flow of $1 billion, assuming WTI crude prices at $75.00. CPG stock is trading lower because WTI crude prices closed below $70 last week. Fortunately, the firm may cut expenses to increase its earnings per share, reduce net debt and remain one of the best income stocks to buy.The optimized energy portfolio will pay off in the next few years. Free cash flow will grow while debt declines. Chances are good that as oil prices climb, Crescent Point will increase its dividend more than expected.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported sluggish revenue growth. Revenue grew by 5.5% Y/Y to $9.6 billion.Magna is among the best income stocks to buy, thanks to its partnership with Fisker (NASDAQ:FSR). In 2021, the firms finalized a manufacturing agreement. As Fisker ramps up production of its electric vehicles, investors may bet on that growth through Magna stock.FSR stock is a pure play for EV investors while Magna pays a growing dividend.

Magna pointed out that it increased its dividend per share by an average of 11% since 2010.In 2023, when the supply chain in the automotive market stabilizes, Magna may renegotiate its contracts. While discussions continue, the company will cut costs by achieving operational efficiency.

Its monthly dividend is the 120th dividend increase. Income investors are not showing their appreciation for the small but steady dividend increase.O stock traded as high as $75.40 in the last year. As the stock falls, investors who took advantage of the $55.50 low in Oct. 2022 have another chance to increase their allocation.Realty Income is careful not to look into debt refinancing at higher interest rates. Instead, it looks at the debt capital market over the next three years. It will take advantage of establishing a credit revolver extension at lower rates. When the Federal Reserve eventually cuts interest rates, Realty Income will probably re-finance more of its debt.Real estate acquisitions are a source of growth.

After its share price fell, investors get a discount on this income stock to buy. In the last quarter, deposits fell by almost 10% year-on-year and sequentially. Eventually, fears of a bank deposit runoff must end.State Street navigated through interest rate cycles before. The latest 25 bps rate hike will not hurt the $1 trillion in client deposits. Chief Financial Officer Eric Aboaf said that clients are shifting their deposits among its global advisors, State Street products and money market.In addition, they are holding more interest-bearing assets. CFO Aboaf expects them to increase their holdings in assets that pay interest. This reduces the risk of clients withdrawing their deposits.The bank should enjoy higher margins from net interest income. By the end of this year and into 2024, NII should stabilize at higher levels. Customers will slow their asset allocation out of non-interest-bearing assets. Such assets earn fewer profits for State Street.Teck Resources (TECK)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockTeck Resources (NYSE:TECK) announced a $250 million stock buyback besides its $0.625 a share dividend on Class A shares.Zinc mining is Teck’s growth driver.

Zinc Mark is a framework that promotes responsible production practices.In February, Teck announced it would spin off its steelmaking coal business to shareholders. The reorganization lets investors choose between a base metals producer and a steelmaking producing unit. The metals unit should retain an investment-grade rating. The steelmaking coal unit will expose investors to the strong long-term steel market.TECK stock is sharply below the $46.43 reached only a month ago.

With several reports of oil spills in different areas of the world in recent years, it seems that even under mounting international pressure to respond to climate change, oil and natural gas companies are failing to implement the necessary standards to prevent these events. So, just what can energy companies do to prevent oil spills and the devastating effects that follow?Last year, in North America, Canada's TC Energy Corp was forced to shut its Keystone pipeline in the U.S. after more than 14,000 barrels of oil spilled into a creek in Kansas. This marked the biggest spill of crude in the U.S. in almost a decade. The 662,000-bpd pipeline delivers heavy crude from Alberta in Canada to U.S. refiners in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. But this was not the first spill seen from Keystone, with other major examples in 2011, 2016, 2017, and twice in 2019. Around 12,000 barrels of oil are thought to have been spilt from Keystone since it became operational in 2010.The spill was a result of a ruptured stretch of the pipeline. And to make matters worse, TC Energy has been accused of allowing the pressure inside parts of its Keystone system — including the stretch through Kansas — to exceed the typical maximum permitted levels in the past, which has long concerned environmentalists. However, the company stated, “At the time of the incident, the pipeline was operating within its design and regulatory approval requirements.”Elsewhere, in the Philippines, just last month a tanker carrying 800,000 litres of industrial fuel oil sank off the coast of the Oriental Mindoro province. The oil from the MT Princess Empress has since reached the shore of fishing villages in the region and caused many people to fall sick.The Philippines authorities have declared a state of calamity for the areas affected, as well as a fishing ban while the spill is being cleaned. The fishing ban is already having a major effect on the locals, with over 18,000 fishermen across 60 villages relying on fishing for their livelihoods. It could also harm tourism in the region. Further, the environmental risks could be huge, with the spill threatening 36,000 hectares of coral reef, mangroves, and seagrass.Story continuesRelated: WTI Crude Gains As Banking Fears Ease, Kurdish Oil Exports Remain SuspendedAnd in the U.K., around 200 barrels of reservoir fluid leaked into the Poole harbour, in the southwest of England, last week. Poole Harbour Commissioners (PHC), the harbour regulator, stated that the leak occurred at a pipeline operated by gas company Perenco. The fluid is said to consist of 85 percent water and 15 percent oil. Perenco said that some of the oil had already been recovered and much of the slick appeared to be dispersing. The company closed down and sealed the pipeline to avoid further leakage. Following the leak, thegovernment launched an investigation after MPs raised concerns about sensitive nature reserves and the impact on local fisheries. Environmental campaigners also gathered at the site to draw attention to the situation and warn of the potential impact of oil spills on the environment.Meanwhile, in Nigeria, residents in the oil-rich Niger Delta are taking action as over 13,000 people sue oil major Shell for years of spills in the region. The health of those living in the region has been long affected by a multitude of spills that have occurred over several years, which have also threatened the livelihoods of fishermen in the region, as many fish have died in tainted waters. There have been 55 oil spills in the last 12 years, with the region now being referred to as one of the most polluted places on earth.The court case has yet to be resolved, with worried that Shell has repeatedly escaped accountability in the past. However, in 2021, the U.K. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that there was a “good arguable case” that Shell plc, the U.K. parent company, was legally responsible for the pollution caused by its Nigerian subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company and that the case would proceed in the English courts.As we see repeated instances of oil spills all around the world, from pipelines and sea vessels, just what should energy companies be doing to prevent these events? Firstly, governments must strengthen their regulatory frameworks and give regulators the power to enforce strict standards on all energy companies to prevent spills. Oil and gas firms should be obligated to put new leak detection technologies in place, and ensure they are up to date in line with technological innovations. In addition, the development of industry-sponsored safety institutions would allow for greater research and development, to advise oil and gas operators. Companies should also be required to provide specialised training to their workers on spill prevention and be prepared to carry out emergency response measures. Finally, oil and gas companies should establish spill reduction targets and be transparent about these goals to enhance accountability.So long as there are oil and gas operations, the unfortunate inevitability of oil spills remains, with several having been seen in the last year alone. However, there are several ways that governments and energy firms can mitigate the risk of these spills and reduce the instances of spills. By strengthening the regulatory framework and holding oil and gas companies accountable for their operational safety, future spills may be prevented and the response to equipment failures improved.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Climb As Iraq's Dispute With Kurdistan EscalatesPetroChina Sees Chinese Fuel Demand Rising By 3% From Pre-Covid LevelsMercedes Signs Deal With Spanish Renewables GiantRead this article on OilPrice.com]"
10,33108afd-9a62-3ded-a03d-5d3559c641f4,O,2023-04-02,Kicking Coal May Be A Trillion Dollar Challenge For India,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kicking-coal-may-trillion-dollar-170000827.html,1680368400,STORY,['CL=F'],"[On a global scale, coal dependency is the single-biggest barrier to reaching international climate goals. Every feasible pathway to capping global warming to 1.5º-2º Celsius over pre-industrial averages hinges on the complete phase-out of the dirtiest fossil fuel. But kicking coal has proven to be an extreme challenge, especially in developing countries where energy demand is rising, coal is abundant, and funds are limited.The conversation around the green transition in developing countries is a complicated one, and presents major trade-offs. Moving away from fossil fuels, and particularly coal, is essential for environmental wellbeing, but energy is essential to opportunity growth and human dignity. Without affordable, accessible, and reliable energy, it is impossible for developing countries to do just that: develop. Achieving a “just transition” in such contexts will require an enormous amount of climate financing and social safety nets to make sure that citizens aren’t harmed more than they’re helped by clean energy initiatives.One of the biggest challenges in this regard is India, which is already one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, while still struggling to keep up with energy demand. Coal is currently responsible for about a third of India’s energy mix. India is the third largest coal producer in the world, and has the third biggest coal reserves after the United States and China. Even with these vast amounts of domestic coal, India is also the world’s eighth largest coal importer. Overall, the subcontinent has an annual coal production of 310 million tonnes and imports of almost 25 million tonnes.Related: Chinese Oil Major Eyes Significant Output BoostWeaning India off of coal won’t be easy, or cheap. A think tank out of New Delhi recently calculated that a just transition away from coal in India will cost approximately $900 billion over the next 30 years. The International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, known by the acronym iFOREST calculated that $600 billion would be needed for investments in new industries and infrastructure, and $300 billion would be allocated for grants and subsidies to support coal industry workers and affected communities. These social protections would be of enormous importance. According to the iForest reports, quitting coal overnight would cost Indians over five million jobs.Story continuesThe magnitude of this challenge – and its enormous price tag – has led Indian officials to resist agreements calling for the complete phaseout of coal. At the COP26 climate conference in 2021, China and India were instrumental in watering down the language of the final agreement from “phasing out” coal to “phasing down” coal. And at COP27, India negotiated to change language specific to coal to more broadly refer to fossil fuels as a whole. ""Natural gas and oil also lead to emission of greenhouse gases. Making only one fuel the villain is not right,"" a source in India's delegation at COP27 told the Press Trust of India. But others saw this as a rhetorical ploy to alleviate appropriate and necessary pressure on Indian coal.Making a climate financing deal with richer nations could be a pathway to achieving just transition in India, but so far Indian officials have been reticent. The history of climate financing is littered with broken promises, leading to great skepticism on the part of Indian leadership. Twelve years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, rich nations promised to channel US$100 billion a year in climate financing to less wealthy nations by 2020, but they never made good on that pledge.What’s more, many Indian leaders simply think it’s unfair that they should have to quit coal at all. There are lots of criticisms about ethics and fairness (or lack thereof) of placing the onus of the green energy transition on countries that have not yet benefited from fossil fuels in the way that developing countries already had the chance to do. The global north has historically been responsible for the lion’s share of emissions, and has benefited greatly from this unchallenged energy use. Now they know better, but it’s too late. And many developing countries say it’s unfair that world powers are now trying to keep poorer countries from following the same trajectory.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chinese Oil Major Eyes Significant Output BoostOil’s Low Prices Draw Rash Of HedgingU.S. Unveils Supply Chain Requirements For EV Tax CreditsRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

This will increase cash flow and establish another dividend hike in the future.Realty Income (O)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a widely held REIT. Its monthly dividend is the 120th dividend increase. Income investors are not showing their appreciation for the small but steady dividend increase.O stock traded as high as $75.40 in the last year. As the stock falls, investors who took advantage of the $55.50 low in Oct. 2022 have another chance to increase their allocation.Realty Income is careful not to look into debt refinancing at higher interest rates. Instead, it looks at the debt capital market over the next three years. It will take advantage of establishing a credit revolver extension at lower rates. When the Federal Reserve eventually cuts interest rates, Realty Income will probably re-finance more of its debt.Real estate acquisitions are a source of growth. In the last four years, CEO Sumit Roy said that it grew the business at 5% CAGR. The firm may leverage its core strengths. That includes size, cost of capital, and scale. Competitors have a tough time competing against Realty Income’s advantages.State Street (STT)State Street (STT)Source: ShutterstockState Street (NYSE:STT) is a financial services firm. After its share price fell, investors get a discount on this income stock to buy. In the last quarter, deposits fell by almost 10% year-on-year and sequentially. Eventually, fears of a bank deposit runoff must end.State Street navigated through interest rate cycles before. The latest 25 bps rate hike will not hurt the $1 trillion in client deposits. Chief Financial Officer Eric Aboaf said that clients are shifting their deposits among its global advisors, State Street products and money market.In addition, they are holding more interest-bearing assets. CFO Aboaf expects them to increase their holdings in assets that pay interest. This reduces the risk of clients withdrawing their deposits.The bank should enjoy higher margins from net interest income. By the end of this year and into 2024, NII should stabilize at higher levels. Customers will slow their asset allocation out of non-interest-bearing assets. Such assets earn fewer profits for State Street.Teck Resources (TECK)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockTeck Resources (NYSE:TECK) announced a $250 million stock buyback besides its $0.625 a share dividend on Class A shares.Zinc mining is Teck’s growth driver. It is focusing on copper production, so investors benefit from multiple markets. On Mar. 16, 2023, Teck announced Teck Trail Operations committed to Zinc Mark. Zinc Mark is a framework that promotes responsible production practices.In February, Teck announced it would spin off its steelmaking coal business to shareholders. The reorganization lets investors choose between a base metals producer and a steelmaking producing unit. The metals unit should retain an investment-grade rating. The steelmaking coal unit will expose investors to the strong long-term steel market.TECK stock is sharply below the $46.43 reached only a month ago. Investors who buy the stock at these levels will earn a modest dividend plus capital gain if the share prices rebound.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is a pharmacy store chain. The company has almost 9,000 stores and it deals with customers consistently.It extended its familiarity with customers through a digital solution. CEO Roz Brewer said that it had around 60 million digital engagements with them.To fuel growth, Walgreens acquired its remaining stake in Shields Health for $1.37 billion in Sept. 2022. This will support its specialty pharmacy unit.It acquired full ownership of CareCentrix last Oct. 2022 for around $392 million. WBA is among the inexpensive income stocks to buy as it integrates those businesses. It might outperform expectations after it realizes cost savings.In the next few quarters, Walgreens might grow script volume from 2% in Q1 to 3% by Q2. Marketing programs will boost growth among its thousands of stores.The markets are worried that Walgreens will lose customer traffic volumes as Covid-related treatments slow considerably. Still, Respiratory Syncytial Virus is one of many diseases that will require a visit to a pharmacy.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript March 29, 2023Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Paychex Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note, this call will be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson. Please go ahead, sir.John Gibson: Thank you, Todd. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the paychex third quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ending February 28. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23.We'll then open it up for any of your questions. As you saw in our press release, we delivered solid financial results for the third quarter with total revenue of 8% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 12%. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our employees we completed a successful selling and calendar year-end season with strong sales volumes and revenue retention for the quarter. We continue to see a stable macro environment and demand for our solutions. Our unique value proposition is clearly resonating in the market. Small and midsized businesses continue to show remarkable resilience as seen in our job at index in the last two months as they contend with a constantly changing labor market, inflation, increasing regulations and rising interest rates.Story continuesBefore we get into the third quarter results, I want to take a minute to address the recent volatility in the U.S. banking market as a result of two highly publicized bank closings. We have no cash, restricted cash and investments deposited within Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, and we've met all client fund obligations related to employee payment services and remittances to applicable tax or regulatory agencies. We continue to monitor this situation and believe that our existing client funds held cash, cash equivalents and investment balances are more than sufficient to meet all client fund obligations. We remain ready as we were when the crisis was unfolding to help businesses and their employees whose payroll processing or direct deposits may have been impacted by these bank closures.Paychex has a long-standing track record for being a stable place for customers, employees and investors during all types of macroeconomic situations and crisis, and we demonstrated that once again. The selling season was positive in terms of both revenue and volumes in a very highly competitive environment. In particular, demand has remained strong for our HR outsourcing solutions though as we've reported in prior quarters, we continue to see a trend of client shifting preferences for our ASO model over the PEO model. In the third quarter, we saw revenue retention remaining near record levels and normalization of uncontrollable losses at the very low end of the market. The focus and investment we continue to put in our high-value clients is making the difference in the customer experience.In addition, the advisory assistance we provide our clients is critical in these challenging times. Our retention for our HR outsourcing businesses, both ASO and PEO stand at an all-time record high year-to-date. PEO and Insurance Solutions continue to show lower health insurance attachment and enrollment inside those clients that are attaching. This is specifically impacting our PEO in the Florida market and the softer rates for workers' compensation insurance continue to impact the property and casualty part of our insurance agency. We expect these trends to continue early into the next fiscal year and normalize as the year progresses. Paychex is uniquely positioned with a continuum of solutions designed to help businesses in any macro environment.We help them recruit and train employees gain access to capital and provide valuable benefit packages such as insurance and retirement. Through our innovative technology, compliance and HR expertise, we are here to help businesses drive efficiency within their HR processes, which therefore frees a valuable time for them to focus on growing the business. Competing for and retaining employees remain a challenge for today's workforce. And I want to commend Congress and the President for signing the recent SECURE Act 2.0, which will introduce a range of new opportunities for businesses looking to introduce a retirement benefit and make their employee value proposition more competitive. We have begun to launch campaigns to educate the market on the SECURE Act 2.0 and continue to position Paychex as the industry leader in retirement plans that we are.Work, Office, JobPhoto by Damir Kopezhanov on UnsplashWe are working on strategies to leverage our strength in this market and capitalize on this opportunity in the years ahead. As higher interest rates and disruptions in the banking system have both impacted the cost and access of capital for many small and midsized businesses, we have fully embraced this challenge to help them out by proactively assisting our clients and prospects with obtaining financial assistance available to them through non-traditional financial partnerships and through government programs such as PPP and the ERTC program. We continue to see strong demand for our full-service ERTC solution. Many of the businesses we've helped are leveraging their new financial flexibility to reinvest in new solutions, such as a retirement plan, or one of our integrated HCM technologies.Recently, our ERTC service was recognized with a Stevie Award for helping businesses obtain critical financial support. In uncertain times, people look for stable, trusted advisers to help them succeed. I am proud that we have recently been recognized as one of the most admired, one of the most ethical and one of the most innovative companies by several prominent and respected brands. We remain one of Fortune's most Admired Companies in 2023. And for the 15th time, we were named among one of the most ethical companies in the world by Ethisphere. This is a select group of companies that show exceptional commitment to ethical operations, compliance performance and governance and risk practices, including strong commitments to ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion.And today, we are announcing that we have been named to Fortune's list of America's most innovative companies for 2023 due to the innovation we've shown in our products, processes and culture. These awards are the result of the dedication of our 16,000-plus employees who daily are supporting our clients and helping them succeed and doing business the right way every day. Very proud of the team, and I'm very proud of Paychex. There's no question that we are a well-managed and stable market leader that people can depend on. We have a long-standing track record of being there for our customers when they need us most, and we continue to be well positioned to help them through the HR challenges they are facing and whatever comes their way in the future.Now, I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the third quarter.Efrain Rivera: Thanks, John. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you the customary things I remind you that during these conversations, we're going to talk about forward-looking statements. Items like EBITDA, non-GAAP measures, please refer to our press release for more information on these topics. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and finish up with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Total revenue for the quarter, as you saw, grew 8% to $1.4 billion. Total service revenue increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Obviously, we're benefiting from increase in interest rates. Management Solutions revenue increased 7% to $1 billion, driven by additional product attachment, HR ancillary services.It's largely what we've discussed previously, our ERTC product and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remains strong and contributed approximately 1% to revenue growth in the quarter. Demand for this product along with our internal execution, have continued to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind, and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will eventually become -- will eventually moderate and become a headwind as we progress through next year -- next fiscal year. Beyond Insurance Solutions revenue increased 6% to $321 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees.The rate of growth was impacted by factors previously discussed, including lower medical plan sales and participant volumes, along with the mix shift to ASO as John called out. We expect these trends to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2020, meaning a little bit more of a balance between PEO and ASO. Interest on funds held for clients increased significantly to $35 million in the quarter, primarily due, as you know, to higher average interest rates. Total expenses were up 8% to $769 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates in general course to support growth in our business. Op income increased 9% to $612 million, with an operating margin of 44.3%, a slight expansion over the prior year period.Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to 22.3% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a higher volume of stock-based comp -- and stock-based comp payments and the recognition of a tax credit related to our development of client-facing software that generated the difference in rates. Net income increased 9% to $467 million and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter to $1.29 per share. Let me quickly summarize the results for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Performance has been strong. Total service revenue increased 8% to $3.7 billion, and total revenue was up 9% to $3.8 billion. Management Solutions was up 9% to $2.8 billion.PEO and Insurance Solutions up 6% to $877 million. Op income increased 9% with a margin of 41.8%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $1.2 billion and $3.31 per share. Our financial position remains strong, as you can see, with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion. Total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of February 28, 2023, cash flow from operations, again, solid for the first nine months was at $1.3 billion and with an increase from priority driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We've had our quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $854 million during the nine months of fiscal 2023 year 12-month rolling return on equity was the seller superb for 47%.Now let me turn to our guidance. For the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, our current outlook incorporates our results for the first nine months in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter, updated guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue now expected to grow slightly above 8%. We previously guided to a range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions outlook is unchanged at growth in the range of 5% to 7%, although we anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. We expect Q4 PEO and Insurance Solutions growth to be below 5% due to the factors that we've talked about through much of the year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million.Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%. Other income and expense net is now expected to be income of $10 million to $15 million, obviously due to higher interest rates. Remember, we met interest income there with our expense on the debt. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 12% to 14%. So we tightened the range, obviously, one quarter left. Guidance for margins and effective tax rates are unchanged, but we do anticipate being on the higher end of the range for operating margin and the lower end of the range for effective tax rate. We currently are in the middle of our annual budget process and are working on expectations for next fiscal year. As you know, this is challenging for a number of different reasons, not the least of which are expected outcomes in terms of interest rates and also economic environment.We'll provide final guidance for fiscal 2023 during fiscal 2023's fourth quarter earnings call in June. However, let me share some of our preliminary thought process around fiscal 2024. On a preliminary basis, we believe that the exit rate in the fourth quarter is a decent approximation for total revenue growth for 2024. This should result somewhere in the range of 6% to 7%. And again, we got more to do there, but just giving you what our thought process is at the moment. And it's heavily dependent on what we think will happen with interest rates during the year. And at this point, our assumptions are conservative. Management Solutions is expected to be lower as a result of moderating ERTC revenues. We called that out last year didn't happen.It actually went the other way. We do think it's going to happen next year. And then PEO and Insurance revenue growth is expected to trend higher as we progress through the year with moderation in some of the headwinds we have experienced this year primarily around insurance attachment and also, as we called out mix shift to ASO. We remain committed to improving margins and we anticipate that operating margin will expand at this stage in the range of 25 to 50 basis points for fiscal 2024. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which can change, especially if there are significant changes to the macro environment, which at this stage, we are not seeing. I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information.And now, let me turn the call back over to John.John Gibson: Thank you, Efrain. With that now being complete, Todd, we'll open up the call for any questions people have.See also 25 Best Free PC Games of 2023 and Top 20 Women-Owned Companies in the US.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:PM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 77% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 7.2% last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 5.9% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Philip Morris International, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Philip Morris International. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Philip Morris International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Philip Morris International is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company, with ownership of 17%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 6.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Philip Morris International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$217m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Philip Morris International .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

18,a899d2cd-0d9d-3ca9-877e-ebf881d3c523,GPN,2023-04-02,3 Growth Stocks That Have Strong Competitive Advantages,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-stocks-strong-competitive-112656195.html,1680175616,STORY,"['SHOP', 'ADSK', 'GPN']","[Growth stocks to buy are again gaining interest following the Federal Reserve’s recent increase of the target federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points.While the central bank didn’t explicitly state that it anticipated further rate hikes, its year-end federal funds rate projections held steady at 5.1%.After the release, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, held a press conference. At the conference, he affirmed that the U.S. economy is experiencing disinflation. He also expressed assurance in the robustness of the banking industry.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnsurprisingly, the current market conditions have caused people to focus on buying growth stocks. People are now investing in such stocks to gain higher returns now that the Federal Reserve is less hawkish.This list focuses on businesses with a competitive edge over their rivals. By prioritizing companies with a long track record of competitive advantages, this list is tailored to identify stocks with the potential for sustained growth.However, each stock on this list comes with its risk profile. So, it would be best if you judged which company is better for you and your portfolio.Keeping this in mind, here are three prominent growth stock to buy worth considering for your portfolio:Growth Stocks to Buy: Shopify (SHOP)Shopify on the phone display.Source: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.comShopify (NYSE:SHOP) has established a reputation as a modern-day Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by equipping small businesses with the necessary resources to rival technology behemoths. Only a handful of other companies have been able to match Shopify’s level of execution.Shopify’s expansion into various areas like FinTech, fulfillment, and partnerships with large companies demonstrates its commitment to horizontal growth. By diversifying its offerings and venturing into new sectors, Shopify is positioning itself for continued growth and success in the future.Story continuesIn particular, operating in the e-commerce space gives Shopify a unique advantage as it grows.According to Statista, the eCommerce market is set to continue growing. Revenue is projected to reach $4.11 trillion in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 11.51%. This will result in a market volume of $6.35 trillion by 2027. Users are expected to increase to 5.29 billion by 2027, with user penetration at 57.2% in 2023 and 66.6% in 2027. China is the leading revenue generator in the eCommerce market. Statista is projecting the country’s projected market volume of $1.487 trillion in 2023.The optimistic figures suggest that the eCommerce market is on the brink of significant expansion in the coming years, and Shopify is positioned to reap substantial rewards from this growth.Additionally, Shopify holds a specific advantage compared to Amazon, which is the big fish in the industry. Amazon is a giant online retailer with an extensive range of products. However, Shopify is a platform that helps small and medium-sized businesses establish and run their online stores.In summary, Shopify is one of the best growth stocks to buy due to its competitive advantages.Autodesk (ADSK)Is Autodesk Stock Still A Buy At New Highs? 3 Pros, 3 ConsSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is the global industry standard for computer-aided design software. Autodesk’s products find application in many industries, ranging from architecture and engineering to construction and product design and manufacturing. Due to their complexity, they have high switching costs.Autodesk’s fiscal year 2023, which ended in January of this year, was impressive overall. The company experienced revenue growth in all geographies, including an 18% increase in the United States.Autodesk’s primary segments, namely architecture/construction, manufacturing, media, and AutoCAD, exhibited growth in sales. Additionally, the company demonstrated strong profitability, generating $2 billion in free cash flow for the full year.Why are shares dropping, then? It’s because of the company’s lower-than-expected free cash flow guidance for the fiscal year 2024. Despite anticipating a year-over-year revenue increase of 7% to 9%, the management forecasts a decline in free cash flow generation to $1.2 billion. While this may be concerning at first glance and has caused the stock to fall, it is not a significant issue for long-term shareholders.Autodesk recently moved from multi-year contracts, which collected cash up front, to an annual billing cycle. This change is now being implemented, resulting in a temporary decrease in the company’s cash collections for 2024. However, the company is still signing new deals with customers at an impressive pace.If you are looking for growth stocks to buy, it makes sense to want a company that is not too red hot right now. Investors need to look at the dip in price as a potential buying opportunity. That is what made Warren Buffett an investing guru. Keeping that in mind, Autodesk presents a great opportunity right now.Global Payments (GPN)Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockMerchant acquirers stand to benefit from the sustained expansion of credit card companies. These acquirers offer merchants credit card terminals, software, and related services. One such player in this space is Global Payments (NYSE:GPN), which enables its clients to accept various payment types, including cards, electronic payments, checks, and digital wallets.Global Payments has been a formidable growth engine, registering a compounded annual revenue growth rate of 16% over the last ten years. The company’s impressive growth trajectory persisted in 2022, evidenced by its annual revenue of $8.976 billion, which marked a 5.3% upswing from the previous year (2021).Furthermore, Global Payments Network reported an increase of 14% in adjusted earnings per share, or 17% in constant currency, rising from $8.16 in 2021 to $9.32.Despite the obstacles, Global Payments achieved considerable growth in 2022 and anticipates similar double-digit growth in 2023.Global Payments, a payments processor with a longstanding history, is adjusting to the current landscape of digital solutions. According to management, the company plans to take an assertive approach to mergers and acquisitions in the coming months, searching for undervalued digital payments firms.In essence, Global Payments is a top-performing company experiencing growth in tandem with the expansion of credit firms over the past few years. With the stock down more than 26% over the last 12 months, the time is ripe to take advantage. Although a stable pick among growth stocks to buy, Global Payments possesses the attributes to pay back investors handsomely.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

24,9f33e25a-a569-3bd1-b9c1-2e7efef46248,M,2023-04-02,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-051140948.html,1680412300,STORY,['M'],"[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com - In the end, the first quarter of 2023 came down to Mother Nature and several bank failures. Depending which side of the trade they were on, the world’s best-known hedge funds were either on a roll or having some of their worst luck ever.Natural gas had its worst plunge in a three-month stretch due to unseasonably warm winter. Gold had an unprecedented 9% rally for two quarters in a row, thanks to a banking crisis, which almost left oil too with a double-digit quarterly loss that those long crude managed to slash in the final week of March. In 2022, the best performing hedge fund strategies were macro, including the sub-strategies of fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative, trend-following CTAs or Commodity Trading Advisors.Arguably, last year was an easier one for CTAs. Then, most commodities were one-way trades - going higher and higher - for most of the year (or at least six to nine months) as the Russian invasion of Ukraine upended supply of almost every raw material from oil to wheat and shook up the global economy. It was only in the second half that some measure of supply stability began to appear, resulting in market volatility that trapped some trend-followers on the wrong side.Despite those late price swings, the HFRI 500 Index, which tracks commodities and runs under the Hedge Fund Research Intelligence banner, broadly outperformed the equity and fixed-income markets and especially technology stocks - by 3,000 basis points, the widest margin since the index's inception.But this year brought a completely different challenge, one that few CTAs could have anticipated. The banking crisis, which began in the U.S. and quickly grew tentacles in Europe, altered the risk/ return profiles of virtually all major asset classes. Hedge fund managers were forced to adjust their playbook. Those who could do so quickly outperformed managers who were set in their ways. In some cases, smaller funds were nimbler than their larger counterparts, which enabled them to adapt quickly.Story continuesMacro funds which lost money might face investor redemptions, Don Steinbrugge, founder and chief executive of Agecroft Partners, said in comments carried by Reuters on Friday. ""For people who invest in CTAs, they tend to understand if you have sharp reversals, they are not going to do well staying with them,"" Steinbrugge said.Thus, trend-following funds were quicker to bail this year on trades that stopped working, a pension fund director who invests in hedge funds said in the Reuters report. He, however, does not plan to reduce his investment in trend funds because he believes their strategies will work over the year.Jim Neumann, chief investment officer of alternatives advisory firm Sussex Partners, said many funds were caught off guard in short positions in sovereign debt markets. The blowup in banks caused investors to flee to the safety of bonds, sending yields down at a rate not recorded since the 2008 financial crisis. “The violent swings in the global rates markets took their toll on many discretionary and systematic (CTAs) managers,"" said Neumann, adding portfolio managers on average cut risk exposure by 50% following the selloff.Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management’s diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period.Famed oil trader Pierre Andurand is, meanwhile, emerging as one of the biggest hedge fund losers this year after the banking crisis sent shock waves through commodities markets. The London-based trader’s flagship Andurand Commodities Discretionary Enhanced Fund has slumped about 40% so far this year, Bloomberg says, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Most of the losses occurred in March, as U.S. crude hit 15-month lows of below $65 per barrel at one point. The flagship fund of Andurand, who manages some $1.4 billion, was down 23% this month through mid-March.Andurand, who runs the fund with a high-conviction strategy with no set risk limits, has predicted that oil prices may exceed $140 a barrel this year. He has said the recent fall was not backed by fundamentals and all the indicators he uses were getting more bullish. The losses this year are enough to wipe out all of Andurand’s 2020 gains. His fund surged 154% in 2020, 87% in 2021 and 59% in 2022. At one point last year, his fund was up as much as 160% but gave up most of this rise during the second half of the year as the price of oil sank.He’s among several high-profile hedge fund traders caught out by market movements this year. Said Haidar’s Jupiter macro money pool is down 44% this year following wild bond swings. Billionaire Chris Rokos’ fund has reportedly lost about 10% for the year through mid-February, erasing all gains this year.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Against the odds, oil bulls coasted to a second straight week of gains that sharply pared losses forced by the U.S. banking crisis two weeks ago. Yet, they fell short of turning March into a positive month, and took an even bigger hit for the quarter.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude did a final trade of $75.70 on Friday, as per Investing.com data. It officially settled the session at $75.67, up $1.30, or 1.8%, on the day, after a session high at $75.72 that marked a two-week peak. For the week, WTI was up 9.2%. Combined, the past two weeks slashed 11% off the 13% drop WTI endured three weeks ago. For the month though, the U.S. crude benchmark was off by 1.8%, while for the quarter, it showed a loss of 6%.London-traded Brent crude did a final trade of $79.94 on Friday, as per Investing.com data. Brent officially settled the session at $79.77, up 50 cents, or 0.6%, on the day. For the week, Brent rose 6.4%. For the month, the global crude benchmark was down almost 5% and for the quarter, it showed a loss of 7.3%.“Oil prices are continuing to gradually recover but remain way off pre-banking mini-crisis levels,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “The prolonged economic scarring of the last month will likely slow the economy, if not cause a recession,” Erlam said, adding that the recovery may be slow as inventors learn of the longer-term consequences from this month’s banking crisis, with lower interest rate expectations unlikely to help much.Notwithstanding those concerns, this week's gains in oil were supported by bullish demand data on both crude and gasoline.Crude prices could also see further support next week from a meeting of producer group OPEC+ - which has been orchestrating market support in recent months with words more than the production cuts it promised.OPEC+ - an alliance of the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 independent oil producers steered by Russia - is supposed to be practicing a daily output cut of two million barrels. But overproduction by the group is reported commonly, with the refrain being that the market is still balanced.Headlines out of Moscow last week said Russian crude production fell by 300,000 barrels per day in the first three weeks of March, to 9.78M barrels per day. That was, however, still below the 500,000 bpd cut pledged by the Kremlin.Russia’s “fire-sale” of its Urals crude - at $60 a barrel or lower, in compliance with Western sanctions related to the Ukraine war - has been cited as one of the reasons for the inability of the oil market to command a constantly high price for WTI and Brent. Major crude buyers such as India and China have sourced cheap supplies from Russia for months now and cut back on pricier supply from other oil producers, including Saudi Arabia.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookU.S. crude could reach targets above $80 in the coming week if its momentum holds, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“WTI has had a strong rebound with a bullish closing at $75.67, which is inches away from the weekly middle Bollinger Band of $76.55 and the 100-Day SMA of $76.93,” Dixit said, referring to the Simple Moving Average. U.S. crude’s current bullish structure is supported by the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, of $73.75 crossing over to the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $72.60, Dixit said. Another overlap into the 50-Day EMA of $74.90 would endorse further continuation of ongoing rally, he added.“Going forward, the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $76.55 and the 100-Day SMA of $76.93 will be immediate challenges, which may either stop the rally or if decisively cleared, can extend the upward move towards the 5-month EMA of $79,” said Dixit. “In the event the bullish momentum continues above $76.55 - $76.93, we are likely to see more gains in WTI heading towards the major resistance zone of 50-week EMA at $82.66, followed by 100-week SMA at $84.50.”But on the flip side, if $76.55 - $76.93 attracts oil bears, then a selloff could ensure, pushing prices down, towards $73.50 and the horizontal support of $69.50, before a retest of the 200-week SMA of $66.35, Dixit added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity U.S. natural gas prices experienced what appeared to be their biggest plunge in a quarter, handing bulls in the space a loss of more than 50% for the December to March period, as an unusually warm winter led to a huge inventory of the fuel used for heating.Natural gas for May delivery did a final trade of $2.6125 on Friday, as per Investing.com data. It officially settled the session at $2.216 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub — up 11.2 cents, or 5.3%, on the day. For the week, the benchmark gas contract fell 6% while for the month, it lost 19%. Worst was the quarter, where it tumbled 50%.The selloff in gas came amid weaker-than-usual demand for heating that has left 1.853 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, of gas in U.S. {ecl-386||storage}}, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said in its latest inventory reading for the week ended March 24.The current U.S. gas storage is 31% higher from the balance at the same time a year ago and 21% up versus the five-year average for storage, the EIA said. The gas balance for 2023 is the highest in recent memory and remains the bane of bulls in the market who’ve been trying to restart a spectacular rally they enjoyed just months ago, before an unusually warm winter season led to less heating demand, sending excess gas supply into storage.The path forward for gas bulls would be to hope for outsized summer demand that would lead to higher-than-usual storage draws of the fuel for cooling, said analysts. Barring a scorching and long summer, “we still need a decent supply move downward this summer to facilitate balancing this market”, Eric McGuire, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in comments carried by naturalgasintel.com.Natural gas: Price OutlookDespite consistent pressure below the 5-week EMA, lower lows in natural gas are not really attracting seller enthusiasm, said SKCharting’s Dixit. “The bear reluctance is clearly visible,” he said.Daily and weekly charts were showing unambiguous divergence on natural gas prices making lower lows and the Relative Strength Index making higher lows, Dixit said. “We may be approaching an end of bearish correction and rebound from the lows may be taking shape soon, to be confirmed as and when the $3.03 high is taken out, clearing the decks for major reversal,” he said. “It is important to understand here that the rebound/reversal requires fulfillment of certain essential price conditions.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity In what appears to be an unprecedented win, gold prices are up 9% for two quarters back-to-back as memory of this month’s U.S. banking crisis keeps the safe haven in demand, even as risk assets rebound from recent lows.Gold for June delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade at $1,986.70 an ounce on Friday, as per Investing.com data. It officially settled the last trading day of March at $1,986.20 an ounce, down $11.50, or 0.6%. For the week, the benchmark U.S. gold futures contract was down as well, dipping $15.50, or 0.8%, as it compares with the previous Friday settlement of $2,001.70. But for the month, it climbed 8%, and, more importantly, for the quarter, it had a $160 gain that translated to a near 9% win.That quarterly gain is particularly significant as Investing.com data indicates that it’s the first time that gold posted such a large quarterly advance back-to-back. In the previous quarter between September and December, gold futures notched a $154, or 9.2% gain.Adding a cherry to the frosting on the gold cake was the metal’s proximity to the $2,000 perch for much of this month. In the past two weeks, Comex futures have breached $2,000 on six occasions, reinforcing expectations that it will get to $2,100 in due course to set a new record high.Gold highs came even as the S&amp;P 500 climbed 6% over the past three weeks, shrugging off contagion worries from the U.S. banking crisis that led to the collapse of two banks and the rescue of another amid troubles in the European banking sector as well.“It's been a very good start to the year for gold and the banking turmoil in March was another very bullish catalyst for it; so much so that it's barely given back any of those gains as interest rate expectations have barely shifted back and yields have remained lower,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.The Federal Reserve, which has added 475 basis points to U.S. interest rates through nine rate hikes over the past 13 months, is expected to end the tightening cycle between May and June. The central bank has ruled out any rate cuts for this year, though analysts aren’t exactly sure about that.Gold: Price Outlook Gold may be headed for consolidation in the coming week despite the strong monthly and quarterly close, said SKCharting’s Dixit. “Closing $42 below the $2,010 monthly high makes room for ample consolidation against the high and we expect a retest of the 5-week EMA, which may dynamically shift to $1,955.” Dixit said.He added weakness beneath the $1,960-$19,55 support base will put gold under further pressure, pushing prices down towards the major support zone of $1,932-$1,928. On the flip side, consolidation above $1,960 will help gold retest $1,988-$1,993 and reclaim swing high $2010, Dixit said. “The daily chart shows a pennant formation in the range of $1,934-$2,010 and a sustained break above $1,988-$1,993 will indicate a breakout aiming to reach $2060 initially, followed by $2086.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil has good week but poor month; Even poorer quarterGold up 9% for 2 quarters in row as safe haven and risk both shine]"

The Saudis have said publicly that the 23-nation coalition should keep output levels steady all year. Delegates privately predict that, when key members hold a monitoring meeting on Monday, they won’t make any adjustments.Fears over financial contagion are receding and the focus is returning once again to China’s resurgent oil demand, coupled with pressure on Russian output since its invasion of Ukraine. Crude futures have recovered sharply to almost $80 a barrel, buttressing revenue for Riyadh and its allies.“OPEC can intervene with markets when it feels there’s an oversupply,” said Marco Dunand, chief executive officer of commodities trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. But “it’s more likely that once we go through this, we’re going to see the market coming back up.”The oil-market outlook confronting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners remains cloudy.Confidence that prices were heading back to $100 a barrel, widespread in the petroleum industry at the start of the year, has frayed as Russian exports prove resilient against international sanctions. It looks like global supply will be in surplus this quarter.China’s modest new economic growth target of 5% has also sapped optimism among oil investors. Even Goldman Sachs Group Inc., perhaps the most enthusiastic crude bull on Wall Street, has dropped predictions of a return to triple digits this year.Story continuesThe reverberations from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and unraveling of Credit Suisse Group AG further darkened crude’s prospects.Test of ResolveThere was speculation that the price rout could test the resolve of Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who said last month that the production targets fixed when OPEC+ slashed output in late 2022 are “here to stay for the rest of the year, period.”Those predictions have diminished amid crude’s subsequent recovery.“The OPEC leadership will very likely decide that there is no need to exercise the additional cut option” next week, said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC. “But we do not see the group remaining on autopilot until year-end if oil descends into another tailspin.”Top oil traders like Trafigura Group Pte Ltd. and Gunvor Group don’t expect a further price slump. In fact, they predict a rally in the second half of 2023 as China fully emerges from years of Covid lockdowns. Goldman Sachs, while softening its initial price expectations, has doubled down on calls for a commodities boom.Global oil demand remains on track to increase by 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 102 million a day, shifting the market into a deficit this summer, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.The robust outlook for oil consumption comes alongside a pinch on global supplies.Russia, a member of the OPEC+ alliance, has announced a production cutback of 500,000 barrels a day this month in retaliation for sanctions, and promised to keep the reduction in place through to June. European nations have banned Russian barrels, and only provide facilitating services to countries that purchase shipments for less than $60 a barrel.While the country’s oil industry has so far defied predictions of a collapse by diverting crude flows Asia, there are signs that the trade is slowing down, with fuel cargoes floating idle off the coast of Europe, Africa and Latin America.Further disruption is being felt in OPEC member Iraq. A renewed legal dispute between Baghdad and the country’s northern Kurdish region is locking in about 400,000 barrels a day that would normally flow through via Turkey to international markets.When OPEC+ meets in early June to review output levels for the second half, it may have an opportunity to open the taps. In the meantime, ministers are likely to maintain a wait-and-see approach, according to Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official.“I suspect they’ll be keeping their heads down and eyes open,” McNally said.--With assistance from Salma El Wardany, Ben Bartenstein and Fiona MacDonald.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekDungeons &amp; Dragons’ Epic Quest to Finally Make MoneyJohn Wick’s Blowout Opening Lifts Lions Gate, But It Won’t Fix StarzThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeTrump Indictment Is Going to Make US Politics Even More Divisive©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"
26,fb7b52e0-c508-3949-ac50-057807e5501e,M,2023-04-02,Can Big Oil Do More To Prevent Oil Spills?,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oil-more-prevent-oil-190000682.html,1680375600,STORY,['M'],"[Oil spills are very much a thing of the present and if Big Oil wants to stay successful in the green transition it will have to clean up its act. With several reports of oil spills in different areas of the world in recent years, it seems that even under mounting international pressure to respond to climate change, oil and natural gas companies are failing to implement the necessary standards to prevent these events. So, just what can energy companies do to prevent oil spills and the devastating effects that follow?Last year, in North America, Canada's TC Energy Corp was forced to shut its Keystone pipeline in the U.S. after more than 14,000 barrels of oil spilled into a creek in Kansas. This marked the biggest spill of crude in the U.S. in almost a decade. The 662,000-bpd pipeline delivers heavy crude from Alberta in Canada to U.S. refiners in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. But this was not the first spill seen from Keystone, with other major examples in 2011, 2016, 2017, and twice in 2019. Around 12,000 barrels of oil are thought to have been spilt from Keystone since it became operational in 2010.The spill was a result of a ruptured stretch of the pipeline. And to make matters worse, TC Energy has been accused of allowing the pressure inside parts of its Keystone system — including the stretch through Kansas — to exceed the typical maximum permitted levels in the past, which has long concerned environmentalists. However, the company stated, “At the time of the incident, the pipeline was operating within its design and regulatory approval requirements.”Elsewhere, in the Philippines, just last month a tanker carrying 800,000 litres of industrial fuel oil sank off the coast of the Oriental Mindoro province. The oil from the MT Princess Empress has since reached the shore of fishing villages in the region and caused many people to fall sick.The Philippines authorities have declared a state of calamity for the areas affected, as well as a fishing ban while the spill is being cleaned. The fishing ban is already having a major effect on the locals, with over 18,000 fishermen across 60 villages relying on fishing for their livelihoods. It could also harm tourism in the region. Further, the environmental risks could be huge, with the spill threatening 36,000 hectares of coral reef, mangroves, and seagrass.Story continuesRelated: WTI Crude Gains As Banking Fears Ease, Kurdish Oil Exports Remain SuspendedAnd in the U.K., around 200 barrels of reservoir fluid leaked into the Poole harbour, in the southwest of England, last week. Poole Harbour Commissioners (PHC), the harbour regulator, stated that the leak occurred at a pipeline operated by gas company Perenco. The fluid is said to consist of 85 percent water and 15 percent oil. Perenco said that some of the oil had already been recovered and much of the slick appeared to be dispersing. The company closed down and sealed the pipeline to avoid further leakage. Following the leak, thegovernment launched an investigation after MPs raised concerns about sensitive nature reserves and the impact on local fisheries. Environmental campaigners also gathered at the site to draw attention to the situation and warn of the potential impact of oil spills on the environment.Meanwhile, in Nigeria, residents in the oil-rich Niger Delta are taking action as over 13,000 people sue oil major Shell for years of spills in the region. The health of those living in the region has been long affected by a multitude of spills that have occurred over several years, which have also threatened the livelihoods of fishermen in the region, as many fish have died in tainted waters. There have been 55 oil spills in the last 12 years, with the region now being referred to as one of the most polluted places on earth.The court case has yet to be resolved, with worried that Shell has repeatedly escaped accountability in the past. However, in 2021, the U.K. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that there was a “good arguable case” that Shell plc, the U.K. parent company, was legally responsible for the pollution caused by its Nigerian subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company and that the case would proceed in the English courts.As we see repeated instances of oil spills all around the world, from pipelines and sea vessels, just what should energy companies be doing to prevent these events? Firstly, governments must strengthen their regulatory frameworks and give regulators the power to enforce strict standards on all energy companies to prevent spills. Oil and gas firms should be obligated to put new leak detection technologies in place, and ensure they are up to date in line with technological innovations. In addition, the development of industry-sponsored safety institutions would allow for greater research and development, to advise oil and gas operators. Companies should also be required to provide specialised training to their workers on spill prevention and be prepared to carry out emergency response measures. Finally, oil and gas companies should establish spill reduction targets and be transparent about these goals to enhance accountability.So long as there are oil and gas operations, the unfortunate inevitability of oil spills remains, with several having been seen in the last year alone. However, there are several ways that governments and energy firms can mitigate the risk of these spills and reduce the instances of spills. By strengthening the regulatory framework and holding oil and gas companies accountable for their operational safety, future spills may be prevented and the response to equipment failures improved.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Climb As Iraq's Dispute With Kurdistan EscalatesPetroChina Sees Chinese Fuel Demand Rising By 3% From Pre-Covid LevelsMercedes Signs Deal With Spanish Renewables GiantRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

However, an increasing proportion comes as LNG in ships from the US, Peru and around the world, accounting for 35pc of demand last year.Demand for LNG in Europe and the UK climbed last year after Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe, helping push up gas prices to the record levels that have triggered the cost of living crisis.The UK has three permanent LNG terminals in Wales and Kent, amounting to import capacity of about 48 billion cubic metres per year or about two-thirds of the UK’s gas demand of 72bcm in 2022.Germany has relied heavily on floating gas import terminals since Russian supplies were cut off to help it ramp up capacity to accept LNG shipments.Experts said Britain's import capacity was less of a problem compared to securing the gas at a fair price in the first place.Clive Moffatt, gas consultant at Moffatt Associates and former adviser to the Government on energy security, said: “We have adequate terminal capacity – the problem in the past has been getting what we need when we need it in winter.”Gas prices have eased in recent months thanks to warmer weather. However, prices could rebound later in the year, experts have warned.Niall Trimble, managing director at The Energy Contract Company consultancy, said there is “huge uncertainty” over China’s demand for gas shipment imports in 2023, warning this “may be higher than expected”.]"

Every feasible pathway to capping global warming to 1.5º-2º Celsius over pre-industrial averages hinges on the complete phase-out of the dirtiest fossil fuel. But kicking coal has proven to be an extreme challenge, especially in developing countries where energy demand is rising, coal is abundant, and funds are limited.The conversation around the green transition in developing countries is a complicated one, and presents major trade-offs. Moving away from fossil fuels, and particularly coal, is essential for environmental wellbeing, but energy is essential to opportunity growth and human dignity. Without affordable, accessible, and reliable energy, it is impossible for developing countries to do just that: develop. Achieving a “just transition” in such contexts will require an enormous amount of climate financing and social safety nets to make sure that citizens aren’t harmed more than they’re helped by clean energy initiatives.One of the biggest challenges in this regard is India, which is already one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, while still struggling to keep up with energy demand. Coal is currently responsible for about a third of India’s energy mix. India is the third largest coal producer in the world, and has the third biggest coal reserves after the United States and China. Even with these vast amounts of domestic coal, India is also the world’s eighth largest coal importer. Overall, the subcontinent has an annual coal production of 310 million tonnes and imports of almost 25 million tonnes.Related: Chinese Oil Major Eyes Significant Output BoostWeaning India off of coal won’t be easy, or cheap. A think tank out of New Delhi recently calculated that a just transition away from coal in India will cost approximately $900 billion over the next 30 years. The International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, known by the acronym iFOREST calculated that $600 billion would be needed for investments in new industries and infrastructure, and $300 billion would be allocated for grants and subsidies to support coal industry workers and affected communities. These social protections would be of enormous importance. According to the iForest reports, quitting coal overnight would cost Indians over five million jobs.Story continuesThe magnitude of this challenge – and its enormous price tag – has led Indian officials to resist agreements calling for the complete phaseout of coal. At the COP26 climate conference in 2021, China and India were instrumental in watering down the language of the final agreement from “phasing out” coal to “phasing down” coal. And at COP27, India negotiated to change language specific to coal to more broadly refer to fossil fuels as a whole. ""Natural gas and oil also lead to emission of greenhouse gases. Making only one fuel the villain is not right,"" a source in India's delegation at COP27 told the Press Trust of India. But others saw this as a rhetorical ploy to alleviate appropriate and necessary pressure on Indian coal.Making a climate financing deal with richer nations could be a pathway to achieving just transition in India, but so far Indian officials have been reticent. The history of climate financing is littered with broken promises, leading to great skepticism on the part of Indian leadership. Twelve years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, rich nations promised to channel US$100 billion a year in climate financing to less wealthy nations by 2020, but they never made good on that pledge.What’s more, many Indian leaders simply think it’s unfair that they should have to quit coal at all. There are lots of criticisms about ethics and fairness (or lack thereof) of placing the onus of the green energy transition on countries that have not yet benefited from fossil fuels in the way that developing countries already had the chance to do. The global north has historically been responsible for the lion’s share of emissions, and has benefited greatly from this unchallenged energy use. Now they know better, but it’s too late. And many developing countries say it’s unfair that world powers are now trying to keep poorer countries from following the same trajectory.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chinese Oil Major Eyes Significant Output BoostOil’s Low Prices Draw Rash Of HedgingU.S. Unveils Supply Chain Requirements For EV Tax CreditsRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Depending which side of the trade they were on, the world’s best-known hedge funds were either on a roll or having some of their worst luck ever.Natural gas had its worst plunge in a three-month stretch due to unseasonably warm winter. Gold had an unprecedented 9% rally for two quarters in a row, thanks to a banking crisis, which almost left oil too with a double-digit quarterly loss that those long crude managed to slash in the final week of March. In 2022, the best performing hedge fund strategies were macro, including the sub-strategies of fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative, trend-following CTAs or Commodity Trading Advisors.Arguably, last year was an easier one for CTAs. Then, most commodities were one-way trades - going higher and higher - for most of the year (or at least six to nine months) as the Russian invasion of Ukraine upended supply of almost every raw material from oil to wheat and shook up the global economy. It was only in the second half that some measure of supply stability began to appear, resulting in market volatility that trapped some trend-followers on the wrong side.Despite those late price swings, the HFRI 500 Index, which tracks commodities and runs under the Hedge Fund Research Intelligence banner, broadly outperformed the equity and fixed-income markets and especially technology stocks - by 3,000 basis points, the widest margin since the index's inception.But this year brought a completely different challenge, one that few CTAs could have anticipated. The banking crisis, which began in the U.S. and quickly grew tentacles in Europe, altered the risk/ return profiles of virtually all major asset classes. Hedge fund managers were forced to adjust their playbook. Those who could do so quickly outperformed managers who were set in their ways. In some cases, smaller funds were nimbler than their larger counterparts, which enabled them to adapt quickly.Story continuesMacro funds which lost money might face investor redemptions, Don Steinbrugge, founder and chief executive of Agecroft Partners, said in comments carried by Reuters on Friday. ""For people who invest in CTAs, they tend to understand if you have sharp reversals, they are not going to do well staying with them,"" Steinbrugge said.Thus, trend-following funds were quicker to bail this year on trades that stopped working, a pension fund director who invests in hedge funds said in the Reuters report. He, however, does not plan to reduce his investment in trend funds because he believes their strategies will work over the year.Jim Neumann, chief investment officer of alternatives advisory firm Sussex Partners, said many funds were caught off guard in short positions in sovereign debt markets. The blowup in banks caused investors to flee to the safety of bonds, sending yields down at a rate not recorded since the 2008 financial crisis. “The violent swings in the global rates markets took their toll on many discretionary and systematic (CTAs) managers,"" said Neumann, adding portfolio managers on average cut risk exposure by 50% following the selloff.Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management’s diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period.Famed oil trader Pierre Andurand is, meanwhile, emerging as one of the biggest hedge fund losers this year after the banking crisis sent shock waves through commodities markets. The London-based trader’s flagship Andurand Commodities Discretionary Enhanced Fund has slumped about 40% so far this year, Bloomberg says, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Most of the losses occurred in March, as U.S. crude hit 15-month lows of below $65 per barrel at one point. The flagship fund of Andurand, who manages some $1.4 billion, was down 23% this month through mid-March.Andurand, who runs the fund with a high-conviction strategy with no set risk limits, has predicted that oil prices may exceed $140 a barrel this year. He has said the recent fall was not backed by fundamentals and all the indicators he uses were getting more bullish. The losses this year are enough to wipe out all of Andurand’s 2020 gains. His fund surged 154% in 2020, 87% in 2021 and 59% in 2022. At one point last year, his fund was up as much as 160% but gave up most of this rise during the second half of the year as the price of oil sank.He’s among several high-profile hedge fund traders caught out by market movements this year. Said Haidar’s Jupiter macro money pool is down 44% this year following wild bond swings. Billionaire Chris Rokos’ fund has reportedly lost about 10% for the year through mid-February, erasing all gains this year.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Against the odds, oil bulls coasted to a second straight week of gains that sharply pared losses forced by the U.S. banking crisis two weeks ago. Yet, they fell short of turning March into a positive month, and took an even bigger hit for the quarter.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude did a final trade of $75.70 on Friday, as per Investing.com data. It officially settled the session at $75.67, up $1.30, or 1.8%, on the day, after a session high at $75.72 that marked a two-week peak. For the week, WTI was up 9.2%. Combined, the past two weeks slashed 11% off the 13% drop WTI endured three weeks ago. For the month though, the U.S. crude benchmark was off by 1.8%, while for the quarter, it showed a loss of 6%.London-traded Brent crude did a final trade of $79.94 on Friday, as per Investing.com data. Brent officially settled the session at $79.77, up 50 cents, or 0.6%, on the day. For the week, Brent rose 6.4%. For the month, the global crude benchmark was down almost 5% and for the quarter, it showed a loss of 7.3%.“Oil prices are continuing to gradually recover but remain way off pre-banking mini-crisis levels,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “The prolonged economic scarring of the last month will likely slow the economy, if not cause a recession,” Erlam said, adding that the recovery may be slow as inventors learn of the longer-term consequences from this month’s banking crisis, with lower interest rate expectations unlikely to help much.Notwithstanding those concerns, this week's gains in oil were supported by bullish demand data on both crude and gasoline.Crude prices could also see further support next week from a meeting of producer group OPEC+ - which has been orchestrating market support in recent months with words more than the production cuts it promised.OPEC+ - an alliance of the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 independent oil producers steered by Russia - is supposed to be practicing a daily output cut of two million barrels. But overproduction by the group is reported commonly, with the refrain being that the market is still balanced.Headlines out of Moscow last week said Russian crude production fell by 300,000 barrels per day in the first three weeks of March, to 9.78M barrels per day. That was, however, still below the 500,000 bpd cut pledged by the Kremlin.Russia’s “fire-sale” of its Urals crude - at $60 a barrel or lower, in compliance with Western sanctions related to the Ukraine war - has been cited as one of the reasons for the inability of the oil market to command a constantly high price for WTI and Brent. Major crude buyers such as India and China have sourced cheap supplies from Russia for months now and cut back on pricier supply from other oil producers, including Saudi Arabia.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookU.S. crude could reach targets above $80 in the coming week if its momentum holds, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“WTI has had a strong rebound with a bullish closing at $75.67, which is inches away from the weekly middle Bollinger Band of $76.55 and the 100-Day SMA of $76.93,” Dixit said, referring to the Simple Moving Average. U.S. crude’s current bullish structure is supported by the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, of $73.75 crossing over to the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $72.60, Dixit said. Another overlap into the 50-Day EMA of $74.90 would endorse further continuation of ongoing rally, he added.“Going forward, the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $76.55 and the 100-Day SMA of $76.93 will be immediate challenges, which may either stop the rally or if decisively cleared, can extend the upward move towards the 5-month EMA of $79,” said Dixit. “In the event the bullish momentum continues above $76.55 - $76.93, we are likely to see more gains in WTI heading towards the major resistance zone of 50-week EMA at $82.66, followed by 100-week SMA at $84.50.”But on the flip side, if $76.55 - $76.93 attracts oil bears, then a selloff could ensure, pushing prices down, towards $73.50 and the horizontal support of $69.50, before a retest of the 200-week SMA of $66.35, Dixit added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity U.S. natural gas prices experienced what appeared to be their biggest plunge in a quarter, handing bulls in the space a loss of more than 50% for the December to March period, as an unusually warm winter led to a huge inventory of the fuel used for heating.Natural gas for May delivery did a final trade of $2.6125 on Friday, as per Investing.com data. It officially settled the session at $2.216 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub — up 11.2 cents, or 5.3%, on the day. For the week, the benchmark gas contract fell 6% while for the month, it lost 19%. Worst was the quarter, where it tumbled 50%.The selloff in gas came amid weaker-than-usual demand for heating that has left 1.853 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, of gas in U.S. {ecl-386||storage}}, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said in its latest inventory reading for the week ended March 24.The current U.S. gas storage is 31% higher from the balance at the same time a year ago and 21% up versus the five-year average for storage, the EIA said. The gas balance for 2023 is the highest in recent memory and remains the bane of bulls in the market who’ve been trying to restart a spectacular rally they enjoyed just months ago, before an unusually warm winter season led to less heating demand, sending excess gas supply into storage.The path forward for gas bulls would be to hope for outsized summer demand that would lead to higher-than-usual storage draws of the fuel for cooling, said analysts. Barring a scorching and long summer, “we still need a decent supply move downward this summer to facilitate balancing this market”, Eric McGuire, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in comments carried by naturalgasintel.com.Natural gas: Price OutlookDespite consistent pressure below the 5-week EMA, lower lows in natural gas are not really attracting seller enthusiasm, said SKCharting’s Dixit. “The bear reluctance is clearly visible,” he said.Daily and weekly charts were showing unambiguous divergence on natural gas prices making lower lows and the Relative Strength Index making higher lows, Dixit said. “We may be approaching an end of bearish correction and rebound from the lows may be taking shape soon, to be confirmed as and when the $3.03 high is taken out, clearing the decks for major reversal,” he said. “It is important to understand here that the rebound/reversal requires fulfillment of certain essential price conditions.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity In what appears to be an unprecedented win, gold prices are up 9% for two quarters back-to-back as memory of this month’s U.S. banking crisis keeps the safe haven in demand, even as risk assets rebound from recent lows.Gold for June delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade at $1,986.70 an ounce on Friday, as per Investing.com data. It officially settled the last trading day of March at $1,986.20 an ounce, down $11.50, or 0.6%. For the week, the benchmark U.S. gold futures contract was down as well, dipping $15.50, or 0.8%, as it compares with the previous Friday settlement of $2,001.70. But for the month, it climbed 8%, and, more importantly, for the quarter, it had a $160 gain that translated to a near 9% win.That quarterly gain is particularly significant as Investing.com data indicates that it’s the first time that gold posted such a large quarterly advance back-to-back. In the previous quarter between September and December, gold futures notched a $154, or 9.2% gain.Adding a cherry to the frosting on the gold cake was the metal’s proximity to the $2,000 perch for much of this month. In the past two weeks, Comex futures have breached $2,000 on six occasions, reinforcing expectations that it will get to $2,100 in due course to set a new record high.Gold highs came even as the S&amp;P 500 climbed 6% over the past three weeks, shrugging off contagion worries from the U.S. banking crisis that led to the collapse of two banks and the rescue of another amid troubles in the European banking sector as well.“It's been a very good start to the year for gold and the banking turmoil in March was another very bullish catalyst for it; so much so that it's barely given back any of those gains as interest rate expectations have barely shifted back and yields have remained lower,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.The Federal Reserve, which has added 475 basis points to U.S. interest rates through nine rate hikes over the past 13 months, is expected to end the tightening cycle between May and June. The central bank has ruled out any rate cuts for this year, though analysts aren’t exactly sure about that.Gold: Price Outlook Gold may be headed for consolidation in the coming week despite the strong monthly and quarterly close, said SKCharting’s Dixit. “Closing $42 below the $2,010 monthly high makes room for ample consolidation against the high and we expect a retest of the 5-week EMA, which may dynamically shift to $1,955.” Dixit said.He added weakness beneath the $1,960-$19,55 support base will put gold under further pressure, pushing prices down towards the major support zone of $1,932-$1,928. On the flip side, consolidation above $1,960 will help gold retest $1,988-$1,993 and reclaim swing high $2010, Dixit said. “The daily chart shows a pennant formation in the range of $1,934-$2,010 and a sustained break above $1,988-$1,993 will indicate a breakout aiming to reach $2060 initially, followed by $2086.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil has good week but poor month; Even poorer quarterGold up 9% for 2 quarters in row as safe haven and risk both shine]"

With several reports of oil spills in different areas of the world in recent years, it seems that even under mounting international pressure to respond to climate change, oil and natural gas companies are failing to implement the necessary standards to prevent these events. So, just what can energy companies do to prevent oil spills and the devastating effects that follow?Last year, in North America, Canada's TC Energy Corp was forced to shut its Keystone pipeline in the U.S. after more than 14,000 barrels of oil spilled into a creek in Kansas. This marked the biggest spill of crude in the U.S. in almost a decade. The 662,000-bpd pipeline delivers heavy crude from Alberta in Canada to U.S. refiners in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. But this was not the first spill seen from Keystone, with other major examples in 2011, 2016, 2017, and twice in 2019. Around 12,000 barrels of oil are thought to have been spilt from Keystone since it became operational in 2010.The spill was a result of a ruptured stretch of the pipeline. And to make matters worse, TC Energy has been accused of allowing the pressure inside parts of its Keystone system — including the stretch through Kansas — to exceed the typical maximum permitted levels in the past, which has long concerned environmentalists. However, the company stated, “At the time of the incident, the pipeline was operating within its design and regulatory approval requirements.”Elsewhere, in the Philippines, just last month a tanker carrying 800,000 litres of industrial fuel oil sank off the coast of the Oriental Mindoro province. The oil from the MT Princess Empress has since reached the shore of fishing villages in the region and caused many people to fall sick.The Philippines authorities have declared a state of calamity for the areas affected, as well as a fishing ban while the spill is being cleaned. The fishing ban is already having a major effect on the locals, with over 18,000 fishermen across 60 villages relying on fishing for their livelihoods. It could also harm tourism in the region. Further, the environmental risks could be huge, with the spill threatening 36,000 hectares of coral reef, mangroves, and seagrass.Story continuesRelated: WTI Crude Gains As Banking Fears Ease, Kurdish Oil Exports Remain SuspendedAnd in the U.K., around 200 barrels of reservoir fluid leaked into the Poole harbour, in the southwest of England, last week. Poole Harbour Commissioners (PHC), the harbour regulator, stated that the leak occurred at a pipeline operated by gas company Perenco. The fluid is said to consist of 85 percent water and 15 percent oil. Perenco said that some of the oil had already been recovered and much of the slick appeared to be dispersing. The company closed down and sealed the pipeline to avoid further leakage. Following the leak, thegovernment launched an investigation after MPs raised concerns about sensitive nature reserves and the impact on local fisheries. Environmental campaigners also gathered at the site to draw attention to the situation and warn of the potential impact of oil spills on the environment.Meanwhile, in Nigeria, residents in the oil-rich Niger Delta are taking action as over 13,000 people sue oil major Shell for years of spills in the region. The health of those living in the region has been long affected by a multitude of spills that have occurred over several years, which have also threatened the livelihoods of fishermen in the region, as many fish have died in tainted waters. There have been 55 oil spills in the last 12 years, with the region now being referred to as one of the most polluted places on earth.The court case has yet to be resolved, with worried that Shell has repeatedly escaped accountability in the past. However, in 2021, the U.K. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that there was a “good arguable case” that Shell plc, the U.K. parent company, was legally responsible for the pollution caused by its Nigerian subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company and that the case would proceed in the English courts.As we see repeated instances of oil spills all around the world, from pipelines and sea vessels, just what should energy companies be doing to prevent these events? Firstly, governments must strengthen their regulatory frameworks and give regulators the power to enforce strict standards on all energy companies to prevent spills. Oil and gas firms should be obligated to put new leak detection technologies in place, and ensure they are up to date in line with technological innovations. In addition, the development of industry-sponsored safety institutions would allow for greater research and development, to advise oil and gas operators. Companies should also be required to provide specialised training to their workers on spill prevention and be prepared to carry out emergency response measures. Finally, oil and gas companies should establish spill reduction targets and be transparent about these goals to enhance accountability.So long as there are oil and gas operations, the unfortunate inevitability of oil spills remains, with several having been seen in the last year alone. However, there are several ways that governments and energy firms can mitigate the risk of these spills and reduce the instances of spills. By strengthening the regulatory framework and holding oil and gas companies accountable for their operational safety, future spills may be prevented and the response to equipment failures improved.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Climb As Iraq's Dispute With Kurdistan EscalatesPetroChina Sees Chinese Fuel Demand Rising By 3% From Pre-Covid LevelsMercedes Signs Deal With Spanish Renewables GiantRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

However, an increasing proportion comes as LNG in ships from the US, Peru and around the world, accounting for 35pc of demand last year.Demand for LNG in Europe and the UK climbed last year after Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe, helping push up gas prices to the record levels that have triggered the cost of living crisis.The UK has three permanent LNG terminals in Wales and Kent, amounting to import capacity of about 48 billion cubic metres per year or about two-thirds of the UK’s gas demand of 72bcm in 2022.Germany has relied heavily on floating gas import terminals since Russian supplies were cut off to help it ramp up capacity to accept LNG shipments.Experts said Britain's import capacity was less of a problem compared to securing the gas at a fair price in the first place.Clive Moffatt, gas consultant at Moffatt Associates and former adviser to the Government on energy security, said: “We have adequate terminal capacity – the problem in the past has been getting what we need when we need it in winter.”Gas prices have eased in recent months thanks to warmer weather. However, prices could rebound later in the year, experts have warned.Niall Trimble, managing director at The Energy Contract Company consultancy, said there is “huge uncertainty” over China’s demand for gas shipment imports in 2023, warning this “may be higher than expected”.]"

Every feasible pathway to capping global warming to 1.5º-2º Celsius over pre-industrial averages hinges on the complete phase-out of the dirtiest fossil fuel. But kicking coal has proven to be an extreme challenge, especially in developing countries where energy demand is rising, coal is abundant, and funds are limited.The conversation around the green transition in developing countries is a complicated one, and presents major trade-offs. Moving away from fossil fuels, and particularly coal, is essential for environmental wellbeing, but energy is essential to opportunity growth and human dignity. Without affordable, accessible, and reliable energy, it is impossible for developing countries to do just that: develop. Achieving a “just transition” in such contexts will require an enormous amount of climate financing and social safety nets to make sure that citizens aren’t harmed more than they’re helped by clean energy initiatives.One of the biggest challenges in this regard is India, which is already one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, while still struggling to keep up with energy demand. Coal is currently responsible for about a third of India’s energy mix. India is the third largest coal producer in the world, and has the third biggest coal reserves after the United States and China. Even with these vast amounts of domestic coal, India is also the world’s eighth largest coal importer. Overall, the subcontinent has an annual coal production of 310 million tonnes and imports of almost 25 million tonnes.Related: Chinese Oil Major Eyes Significant Output BoostWeaning India off of coal won’t be easy, or cheap. A think tank out of New Delhi recently calculated that a just transition away from coal in India will cost approximately $900 billion over the next 30 years. The International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, known by the acronym iFOREST calculated that $600 billion would be needed for investments in new industries and infrastructure, and $300 billion would be allocated for grants and subsidies to support coal industry workers and affected communities. These social protections would be of enormous importance. According to the iForest reports, quitting coal overnight would cost Indians over five million jobs.Story continuesThe magnitude of this challenge – and its enormous price tag – has led Indian officials to resist agreements calling for the complete phaseout of coal. At the COP26 climate conference in 2021, China and India were instrumental in watering down the language of the final agreement from “phasing out” coal to “phasing down” coal. And at COP27, India negotiated to change language specific to coal to more broadly refer to fossil fuels as a whole. ""Natural gas and oil also lead to emission of greenhouse gases. Making only one fuel the villain is not right,"" a source in India's delegation at COP27 told the Press Trust of India. But others saw this as a rhetorical ploy to alleviate appropriate and necessary pressure on Indian coal.Making a climate financing deal with richer nations could be a pathway to achieving just transition in India, but so far Indian officials have been reticent. The history of climate financing is littered with broken promises, leading to great skepticism on the part of Indian leadership. Twelve years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, rich nations promised to channel US$100 billion a year in climate financing to less wealthy nations by 2020, but they never made good on that pledge.What’s more, many Indian leaders simply think it’s unfair that they should have to quit coal at all. There are lots of criticisms about ethics and fairness (or lack thereof) of placing the onus of the green energy transition on countries that have not yet benefited from fossil fuels in the way that developing countries already had the chance to do. The global north has historically been responsible for the lion’s share of emissions, and has benefited greatly from this unchallenged energy use. Now they know better, but it’s too late. And many developing countries say it’s unfair that world powers are now trying to keep poorer countries from following the same trajectory.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chinese Oil Major Eyes Significant Output BoostOil’s Low Prices Draw Rash Of HedgingU.S. Unveils Supply Chain Requirements For EV Tax CreditsRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

It’s got investors thinking about the end of the bear market. Ultimately, it’s got investors looking at the best stocks for a bull market.To some extent, investing is often about preparation. It’s helpful to devise multiple scenarios so we know how to react. In that event, we can be ready for multiple outcomes depending on how things pan out.Case in point, we don’t know if the current bear market is ending now or when it will ultimately do so. Sure, the stock market has performed pretty darn well in the first quarter of 2023, but there are a lot of mixed signals in the market right now. And admittedly, a recession seems to be barreling toward us.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI am writing this article on the premise that these stocks are not necessarily ones to buy right here, right now. Rather, I’m looking for names that I want to buy on pullbacks or upon the realization that we are truly entering a new bull market. I understand that different investors have different definitions of when that turn will be official.That said, I want to be prepared for when we enter a new bull market, because we will at some point. Let’s look at the best stocks for a bull market.Walt Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockDisney (NYSE:DIS) sure seems to be trading like there’s a recession on the horizon. For long-term buyers stalking Disney stock for a position, this is good news. A 12% pullback from current levels would send Disney down to new 52-week lows. A trip down to about $80 (a decline of about 16.5%) would send shares back down to the 2020 Covid-19 low.It’s possible that we see those prices or worse in the coming weeks or months. But let me tell you something: Once the economy bottoms and begins to rebound, and once the bull market is underway, Disney is going to be a name you’ll want to own for quite some time.Story continuesNot only does it have powerful travel, studio and experiences businesses, but it has grown its digital streaming business into a real powerhouse. Combined, it’s not crazy to assume that Disney will eventually regain its all-time high near $200.Just for some perspective, from current levels, Disney stock would gain more than 100% if and when it takes out that high, which I believe it will do in the next bull market.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been trading much better so far this year. Within the first week of 2023, Tesla stock bottomed and it then more than doubled off the low. If we enter a deep recession, both in the U.S. and/or globally, that’s going to weigh on Tesla’s business.After all, the company is an automaker and as consumer spending power comes under pressure so too will Tesla’s revenue. That said, once the economy fires back up, Tesla will be there to absorb that increase in consumer spending.Not to mention, the company continues to generate very impressive top- and bottom-line growth at the moment, while also generating its own energy revenue.I don’t know if Tesla stock will make new lows again or not. The selling pressure going into late-2022 was pretty intense and it has me thinking that, unless we go into a painful tailspin in the stock market and a deeper recession, we may not see the $100 level tested again.That said, I do believe Tesla shares will make new highs.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe action in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is quite disappointing for bulls. Not only was the stock caught up in a massive selloff, suffering a peak-to-trough decline of 78.6%, but it’s not partaking in the tech-stock rally of 2023!Shares are up just 10% from the 52-week low while many names in tech are up several multiples of that. Tesla more than doubled. So did Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While PayPal is in a different industry than these names, investors would have liked to see a stronger rebound.However, the company has staying power. It’s now forecast to grow revenue and earnings this year and next year, while trading at a reasonable valuation. It now trades at roughly 15 times this year’s earnings forecast. That’s cheap.When the market does eventually return to a bull market, I think money will flow back into PayPal. Even if PayPal only regained half of its losses, it would mark a 150% rally from current levels.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in PYPL.

49,3f989fc4-c97b-3901-b2ed-6b753b04a1b3,IBM,2023-04-02,How New Technology Will Disrupt The Oil And Gas Industry,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/technology-disrupt-oil-gas-industry-230000335.html,1680390000,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'HAL', 'IBM']","[At a certain point in its lifecycle, every industry faces its moment of reckoning with growing pressure to transform due to factors such as increasing competition, changing consumer preferences, government policy and other secular headwinds. The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.For the oil and natural gas industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations.A good case in point is a partnership struck between Haliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL), Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Accenture Plc. (NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.Big savingsSource: CNBCHalliburton is hardly alone.After years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.Barclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs and transportation operating costs.Story continuesAccording to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Inc. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has significantly expanded its partnership with Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services oil and gas division, and counts BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) and Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.In many cases, Big Oil’s digital makeover is quite extensive.For instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields.For years, Big Oil has been using tech companies’ enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including  rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton.However, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations.Is the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend. J.P. Morgan estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just ~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019.Artificial Intelligence (AI)Let’s face it: Our electric grids are simply ill-suited for the energy shift. After all, renewable power is highly intermittent by nature whereas our grids are designed for near-constant power input/output. Indeed, wind and solar energy have the lowest capacity factors of any energy source.For the energy transition to be successful, our power grids have to become a lot smarter. Luckily, there’s an encouraging precedent.Five years ago, Google announced that it had reached 100% renewable energy for its global operations including its data centers and offices. Today, Google is the largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments totalling 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy.In 2017, Google teamed up with IBM to search for a solution to the highly intermittent nature of wind power. Using IBM’s DeepMind AI platform, Google deployed ML algorithms to 700 megawatts of wind power capacity in the central United States--enough to power a medium-sized city.IBM says that by using a neural network trained on widely available weather forecasts and historical turbine data, DeepMind is now  able to predict wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation. Consequently, this has boosted the value of Google’s wind energy by roughly 20 percent.A similar model can be used by other wind farm operators to make smarter, faster and more data-driven optimizations of their power output to better meet customer demand.IBM’s DeepMind uses trained neural networks to predict wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generationSource: DeepMindHouston, Texas-based Innowatts, is a startup that has developed an automated toolkit for energy monitoring and management. The company’s eUtility platform ingests data from more than 34 million smart energy meters across 21 million customers including major U.S. utility companies such as Arizona Public Service Electric, Portland General Electric, Avangrid, Gexa Energy, WGL, and Mega Energy. Innowatts says its machine learning algorithms are able to analyze the data to forecast several critical data points including short- and long-term loads, variances, weather sensitivity, and more. Innowatts estimates that without its machine learning models, utilities would have seen inaccuracies of 20% or more on their projections at the peak of the crisis thus placing enormous strain on their operations and ultimately driving up costs for end-users.Further, AI and digital solutions can be employed to make our grids safer.Three years ago, California’s biggest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, found itself in deep trouble after being found culpable for the tragic 2018 wildfire accident that left 84 people dead and, consequently, was slapped with hefty penalties of $13.5 billion as compensation to people who lost homes and businesses and another $2 billion fine by the California Public Utilities Commission for negligence. Perhaps the loss of lives and livelihood could have been averted if PG&amp;E had invested in some AI-powered early detection system like Innowats.By employing digital and AI models, our power grids will become increasingly smarter and more reliable and make the shift to renewable energy smoother.BlockchainDespite its enormous potential to transform the global energy sector, blockchain technology has largely remained confined to the financial sector with the energy industry consistently catalyzed by innovations in sub-sectors such as rooftop solar, offshore wind, smart metering, battery storage, and electric vehicles.But this is now beginning to change thanks to the Enterprise Ethereum blockchain emerging as the newest technology to spur growth in the energy sector across a raft of verticals from peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and smart contracts to green energy provenance and systems interoperability.Indeed, a Global Blockchain in Energy Market research document says blockchain technology in the energy industry is about to record explosive growth over the next five years with blockchain energy startups such as Power Ledger, WePower, UAB, and LO3 Energy set to open up new possibilities for the energy industry, ranging from cost-savings for the consumer by eliminating third parties in energy deals and faster transaction settlements, all the way to the emergence of a new market for peer-to-peer and excess renewable energy trading.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Climb As Iraq's Dispute With Kurdistan EscalatesPetroChina Sees Chinese Fuel Demand Rising By 3% From Pre-Covid LevelsMercedes Signs Deal With Spanish Renewables GiantRead this article on OilPrice.com]"
50,8efe2467-e7f4-3526-98a6-68a2bfd11386,MKC,2023-04-02,7 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy for Consistent Income Growth,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-aristocrats-buy-consistent-182937570.html,1680028177,STORY,"['ALB', 'JNJ', 'MMM', 'MKC-V', 'DOV', 'BDX']","[I’d argue there’s never been a better time to consider investing in dividend aristocrats. Volatility remains very high in the overall market, with a destabilized banking sector. Additionally, inflation has proven to be anything but transitory. In short, dividend aristocrats, with their larger size and liquidity requirements and 25+ years of successive increasing payments, are generally about as solid as investments can be.Investors who buy into this group will receive consistent income growth, sure. But such investors will also tend to be exposed to the most dependable sectors as well. Consumer staples, industrials, and materials companies comprise the most significant number of dividend aristocrats. These are, unsurprisingly, the sectors that fare best throughout business cycles.These dividend aristocrats have thus grown into steady giants that reward investors with regular income. A current list of the group can be found here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFrankly-speaking, any of these shares represent reasonable investments. Below, I have highlighted seven that I feel are particularly compelling.MMM3M$101.41JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$153.78ALBAlbermarle$219.99MKCMcCormick$74.39DOVDover Corp.$142.90BDXBecton Dickenson$243.07SJMJ.M. Smucker$157.023M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com3M (NYSE:MMM), like most other stocks on this list, engages in a relatively unsexy business. It manufactures and sells products spanning industrial, safety, and consumer goods. And while its products are arguably less-exciting than those offered by tech firms, MMM stock remains compelling to investors interested in securing a long-term and dependable income stream.Currently, MMM stock provides investors with a juicy dividend yield of 5.9% right now. That’s relatively high, and would typically indicate substantial risk if 3M were an average dividend stock.It isn’t. The company has been increasing its dividend since 1959. So, investors can pretty much lock in a 6% return, guaranteed.Story continuesMMM stock also has roughly 15% upside, based on the consensus analyst target price. Expecting 20% returns on 3M shares within a medium-term investment horizon isn’t hyperbolic. Thus, this is a stock long-term investors should take a good look at now.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a healthcare giant, and arguably the biggest household name on this list. Most of us grew up with its products, with its vaccine perhaps being the most recent breakthrough from the company.From an income perspective, Johnson &amp; Johnson is sort of middle-of-the-road. Its 3% dividend is neither high nor low. It is dependable, though, as are all the dividends on this list.The other positive for JNJ stock is that its shares have fallen since the beginning of the year. In fact, JNJ stock has fallen from $180 to around $150 currently. Analysts expect shares to move toward that former figure, implying significant price appreciation upside.JNJ stock carries a current price-to-earnings ratio similar to its median over the past ten years. That suggests that shares are priced right at the moment, but I think this stock could reach its analyst price target in short order.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comDividend aristocrats generally aren’t brimming with growth potential like Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is. Albemarle has immense growth upside, given the fact its core lithium mining business is the lifeblood of the EV boom.Many consider Albermarle to currently be in the middle of a growth cycle. As the EV boom continues, more lithium will be demanded, driving up the valuation of companies like Albermarle. It’s really that simple.Accordingly, investors shouldn’t be surprised that there’s still roughly $100 in upside for ALB shares, based on the consensus analyst target price. This price target is supposed by Albermarle’s booming fundamentals, including Q4 sales that increased by 193% to $2.6 billion and EBITDA that increased by 444% during the same period.Albemarle just announced the location of its lithium Mega-Flex facility to be built in Chester County, South Carolina. Construction will begin in 2024, with the announcement further cementing the firm’s commitment to lithium production.McCormick (MKC)A table is spread with breakfast foods like orange juice, berries and croissants. represents food and beverage stocksSource: ShutterstockThere’s reason to believe McCormick’s (NYSE:MKC) stock could soon increase in price. The spice maker announced price hikes earlier in the quarter. Although there was pushback on those price increases, they could translate to higher earnings for the firm, which has seen revenues decline slightly over the past few years.If higher retail costs translate to better earnings, shareholders should expect MKC shares to rise. That’s perhaps not the primary concern for income investors who like MKC shares for their reliable, though lower-yield, dividend. Although the dividend yields a modest 2.2%, it has grown by 9.4% over the past 5-year period.There’s another reason to believe McCormick could see improved earnings moving forward: a brand redesign of its core herbs and spices line. The redesign has the potential to capture better consumer attention in grocery aisles that are increasingly competitive for kicks. If that happens, MKC stock could logically increase in price.Dover Corp. (DOV)The logo for Dover (DOV) displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comTo be clear, Dover Corp. (NYSE:DOV) stock, with its 1.4% dividend yield, won’t provide spectacular income to investors. Indeed, the company’s dividend has only increased at an average rate of less than 2% over the past five years. That said, the company is about as consistent as they come, even when comparing this company to the other dividend aristocrats on this list.Dover is more of a solid dividend stock with price appreciation potential than anything else. It trades at $140, but has a target price of $167. So, it provides reliable income and substantial price appreciation potential, which is an attractive combination overall.Revenues grew by 8% in 2022 at the auto parts maker that also serves the energy, and engineered products sectors. However, earnings fell by 5% during the same period, as higher prices generally affected suppliers across all industries.The company expects growth in 2023 in the 3-5% range, implying that the company’s dividend is nearly sure to remain safe moving forward.Becton Dickinson (BDX)robotic arms over medical bed symbolizing medical roboticsSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertiseBecton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) provides the medical equipment and supplies that underpin our healthcare system. The necessity of those products means that Becton Dickinson enjoys relatively inelastic demand. That has provided stability to the company, allowing it to pay an increasing dividend since 1972. That dividend has also grown 3.5%, on average, over the past years.Becton Dickinson hasn’t had a particularly strong 2023, to be sure. Shares have fallen by $15 to $241 currently. That’s partly due to a slight revenue decline in 2022 of 2.8%. That’s not a particularly positive way to entice investors leading into a new year. However, Q4 was better, with 1.7% revenue growth over Q4 ’21.None of that is admittedly beautiful to potential investors overall. The real point of attraction for BDX stock is that the company raised full-year guidance from $18.6 to $18.8 billion up to $19.1 to $19.3 billion a few weeks ago.J.M. Smucker (SJM)company sign outside smucker's headquarters SJM stockSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of dividend aristocrats to buy is none other than J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM). Indeed, there are plenty of reasons I think this is a dividend gem to consider right now.For one, the company offers reasonably-priced food, coffee, and pet foods. It’s a consumer staple stock that should continue to do well as inflation runs rampant because it provides affordable necessities. That logically leads to sustainable demand across the business cycle, particularly in recessionary times.The company’s most recent earnings reflect that idea. Sales increased by 8% to $159.2 million for the quarter that ended on 31 January. Those results were pretty much in line with what Wall Street expected. When earnings were released, the company also gave guidance for 6% sales growth in 2023. It’s reasonable to expect that sales could increase, as economic volatility increases.Demand for lower-priced Jif peanut butter and Folgers coffee could increase throughout 2023 as the economy looks to weaken further and the likelihood of a recession rises.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Although the purchase only increased their holding by 1.3%, it is still a solid purchase in our view. See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts Genuine Parts Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by Paul Donahue was the biggest purchase of Genuine Parts shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$167. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for Genuine Parts share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. Paul Donahue was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Genuine Parts Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Genuine Parts insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$55m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Genuine Parts Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Genuine Parts we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Genuine Parts. While conducting our analysis, we found that Genuine Parts has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The hardest hit areas are the northern and western areas of Illinois including Rockford and Dixon. Approximately 23,000 customers remain without power as of 8:00 am, Saturday, April 1 while ComEd and contractor crews work 24/7 to restore service to all remaining customers as quickly and safely as possible.The storms damaged trees and equipment, causing power outages for approximately 94,000 customers. Over 500 ComEd and contractor crews are working around the clock to restore power to customers. ComEd expects that power will be restored to 80 percent of customers by later today, April 1, and nearly all customers no later than Sunday afternoon, on April 2. A small number of customers requiring significant repairs may take longer to restore.""ComEd crews are hard at work throughout the region to restore power to customers following last night’s severe weather,"" said Dave Perez, senior vice-president of Distribution Operations at ComEd. ""We recognize that any outage is frustrating to our customers, and we thank everyone for their patience as we work to safely repair damaged equipment and restore service to our customers as quickly as possible.""Following the Friday storms, high winds, with gusts up to 45 miles per hour, are expected through Saturday afternoon, which can tear down branches, further damaging ComEd equipment and resulting in additional power outages. ComEd has called in additional crews from out of state to help restore customers throughout the weekend.ComEd has been investing in power grid upgrades and tree trimming to minimize the impact of storms. Since smart grid upgrades began in 2011, ComEd has avoided more than 19 million power outages—saving more than $3.3 billion in outage-related costs—and improved overall reliability by more than 80 percent.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. For example, the Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) share price return of 11% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 1.7% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, Colgate-Palmolive failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 8.0% (annualized).Earnings per share have melted like a stack of ice cubes, in stark contrast to the share price. So we'll need to take a look at some different metrics to try to understand why the share price remains solid.It could be that the revenue growth of 4.7% per year is viewed as evidence that Colgate-Palmolive is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthColgate-Palmolive is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Colgate-Palmolive, it has a TSR of 19% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Colgate-Palmolive shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 0.8% over the last year. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 3% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive   you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy What Is Devon Energy's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Devon Energy had US$6.44b in debt in December 2022; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.31b, its net debt is less, at about US$5.13b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Devon Energy's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Devon Energy had liabilities of US$3.11b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$9.32b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$1.31b in cash and US$1.77b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$9.34b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Devon Energy has a huge market capitalization of US$33.1b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Devon Energy has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.50. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 24.2 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Even more impressive was the fact that Devon Energy grew its EBIT by 142% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Devon Energy's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Devon Energy recorded free cash flow worth 57% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Devon Energy's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its EBIT growth rate also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Devon Energy's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example Devon Energy has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) share price is up 24% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 13% over twelve months.The past week has proven to be lucrative for NiSource investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance. See our latest analysis for NiSource To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, NiSource achieved compound earnings per share growth of 27% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of NiSource's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, NiSource's TSR for the last 3 years was 38%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveNiSource shareholders are down 9.8% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -11%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for NiSource   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

86,a90c4d98-ceb2-3e14-af98-155ef6e7b219,UNH,2023-04-02,7 Growth Stocks That Are Crushing the Market in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-crushing-market-215611005.html,1680126971,STORY,['UNH'],"[This year has been nothing if not volatile. Worries of a looming recession – if we’re not already in one – continue to spark fear. Additionally, the Fed recently instituted its ninth consecutive rate increase. This 25 basis point (0.25%) interest rate hike adds pressure to a financial system already troubled by various banking concerns. Yet, despite all the trouble, markets are up year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 up a modest 0.8%. Several growth stocks have proven particularly resilient, providing especially strong returns.There’s some irony there. Higher rates tend to negatively impact growth stocks overall. Last year, this was certainly true, as growth stocks lost significant value. Nevertheless, outliers are continuing to buck conventional wisdom. Let’s look at some of the more prominent names in that conversation.VRMEVerifyMe$1.57METAMeta Platforms$205.35AAPLApple$160.77GOOGAlphabet$101.90ADBEAdobe$379.16UNHUnitedHealth Group$466.59FVRRFiverr$33.24InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerifyMe (VRME)An image of a hexagon network covering the world map with glowing data centers and shield symbolsSource: BeeBright / ShutterstockVerifyMe (NASDAQ:VRME) is an interesting company with respect to its growth potential and relative upside compared to its peers. The Florida firm provides identification and authorizations solutions for verifying people, products, and transactions.Indeed, it’s a given that security is an increasing concern today. Cyber security threats are arguably more important today than they’ve ever been.This is highlighted well by VerifyMe’s recent earnings. The company thus far has fared quite well in 2023, seeing its earnings surge to $1.57 per share from $1.15 per share during the same quarter last year. That 36% growth rate makes the company something of an outlier, and certainly interesting to investors.Back in January, VerifyMe released preliminary Q4 earnings data that anticipated 87% revenue growth on a sequential basis. The company expects $9.7 million in Q4 revenues compared to the $5.2 million it recorded in Q3. The company didn’t give much more in terms of information other than to say that it expects to have $3.3 million in cash on hand as well.Story continuesMeta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comThere’s a lot happening with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) so far this year. This stock is on the rebound, with shares of META stock appreciating 65% on a year-to-date basis. This follows a 2022 that saw shares tank, falling 65% from $332 all the way to $120.There’s a reason why META stock is on the rebound. The company’s resurgence began in early February, when the company telegraphed an improvement in underlying business conditions and rising revenues. Then, the company reported $32.2 billion in revenues as well as a number of cost-cutting measures. These numbers came in better than analysts were expecting, and cost-cuts were music to many investors’ ears.Indeed, the fact that Meta’s management team is pushing for greater efficiency is a big deal to many investors. Rounds of layoffs have signaled the company will do what they say they’re going to do. Despite the human toll these layoffs provide, there’s clear upside for investors with this name.Meta Platforms is also leveraging AI tools to increase the effectiveness of its ad targeting efforts. As a result, user engagement has increased, and the overall feeling is one of a giant ship finally turning in the right direction after a period of turbulence. Profits in Q4 reached $4.7 billion, which snapped a series of three sequential quarters in which profits fell.Apple (AAPL)Apple Stock Looks Too Cheap Here for Investors to Pass UpSource: mama_mia / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another big tech firm that has seen its stock perform well this year. The iPhone, iMac, and iPad maker has done well, despite questions about weakening demand heading into 2023.Consumers aren’t buying Apple products at the rates they did in late-2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Apple saw iPhone sales decline from $71.6 billion to $65.8 billion, and overall sales fell 5.5%, to $117.15 billion.There were a few bright spots despite the overall downturn. The company’s iPad sales jumped nearly 30% to $9.4 billion, and services revenues reached an all-time high of $20.76 billion.Additionally, despite the weaker numbers than what investors have become used to in recent years, Apple remains Apple. Demand may be down for iPhones, sure. But it’s naive to think that consumers are going to abandon Apple products long-term. That might explain why share prices have improved in 2023 even as overall conditions remain difficult to predict. I think demand for iPhones will rebound, and AAPL shares should benefit from that broad notion.Alphabet (GOOG)Source: turtix / Shutterstock.comDepending on how you look at it, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock is crushing it in 2023. The company’s stock price has swung up and down from the start of 2023 (at $90 per share), currently trading for around $102. Again, big tech is proving that it won’t be held lower forever. Even as the Fed continues to raise rates, FAANG stocks continue to rise. If growth stocks and rising interest rates correlate negatively, big tech seems to be providing a strong rebuttal.I’d argue that Alphabet investors ought to simply be grateful for what the company offers investors as market reality sets in. The company’s revenue grew by 10% in 2022, reaching $282.84 billion. Investors can’t expect the 57% revenue growth in 2021 to continue indefinitely for Alphabet/Google. That said, double-digit growth is double-digit growth.Google ad revenues face a new reality in which spending has changed. The free money era of the last decade is over. Companies can’t be spendthrift as they were, meaning lower revenue growth moving forward. Google grew substantially in 2022, and investors should be happy with that.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.comAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) remains a ubiquitous player in most creative industries. The company’s Illustrator and Photoshop tools have become required learning for professionals globally, for good reason.On top of that, Adobe has leveraged the growth of various other software niches in the tech sector, including PDF signature tools with Acrobat, which have driven substantial growth for the company in recent years. Accordingly, it should be no surprise to investors that Adobe has put up some of the best metrics of its peers during the tech contraction over the last year.Adobe’s first quarter included top-line growth of 9.22% and gross profits that grew by a similar amount. Net income contracted slightly, but it’s easy to explain this underperformance away due to inflation.The company continues to proceed with its planned acquisition of Figma, amid regulatory scrutiny. This tool will expand Adobe’s creative asset portfolio, and should be accretive to investors. All in all, ADBE stock represents a growth story, and one which I think could continue for some time, especially once this Figma deal is finalized.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) stock isn’t crushing the market this year. In fact, it’s down so far. But UnitedHealth Group comes with a lot of positives, and investors should expect UNH stock to provide decent returns in 2023.For one, the company provided meaningful growth in 2022, with revenues coming in at $324.16 billion, up 12.7% year-over-year. Current estimates provide for a similar growth rate in 2023. In fact, analysts see the company reporting around $359.7 billion in sales by the end of 2023.UNH stock includes a rock-solid dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1990. Its yield is quite low, but the company has grown its distribution 17.4% over the past 5 years.In short, UNH shares aren’t crushing the market thus far like some of their tech counterparts. But the growth narrative behind UnitedHealth’s business is clear. Accordingly, with healthcare stocks being more stable than tech in general, this is a great way for investors to gain upside exposure in a defensive manner in this market.Fiverr (FVRR)The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.Source: Temitiman / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of growth stocks to buy is Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR), a stock that’s been on fire to start 2023. Indeed, FVRR stock has risen from under $28 to above $33 per share in 2023. This performance exceeds that of the overall market.The Israel-based platform allows gig workers and employees to buy and sell services on a contractual basis. The firm’s growth numbers aren’t staggering, but I can see tailwinds that favor the company this year.First, those growth figures. Fiverr’s revenues grew by 4.2% in Q4 and 13.3% in 2022 on a year-over-year basis, respectively.My guess, for what it’s worth, is that Fiverr could move much closer to its $49.70 target price. The idea is that the gig economy is likely to grow as layoffs rise. Displaced workers are likely to flock to Fiverr’s platform to make up for lost full-time jobs. The result is higher fees paid to Fiverr as overall volume rises.We’ll have to see if this hypothesis plays out. But considering how FVRR stock has moved thus far this year, it’s clear many in the market seem to be aligned with this view.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

92,a027e53d-be79-383a-aa24-6cbc45320fb9,GPS,2023-04-02,GME Stock: What Investors Need to Know About the ‘New’ GameStop,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gme-stock-investors-know-gamestop-191644519.html,1680117404,STORY,"['GME', 'GPS']","[Last week, I noted that short sellers were playing with fire by betting against GameStop (NYSE:GME). High call volumes and low short float meant the meme stock could quickly become a massive short squeeze.On Tuesday, GameStop shareholders scored another win:The company announced its first profit in two years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsShares in the videogame retailer immediately jumped 20% in after-hours trading. By Wednesday, many options holders were booking 10X or more gains.GME Stock: The Classic Wall Street PlaybookIn a sense, GameStop’s profits were highly unexpected. In the same article, I noted how the lack of new consoles and supplier-driven issues would probably make the retailer’s earnings more of a “damp squib.”But it turned out CEO Matt Furlong had an ace up his sleeve: a 15.8% reduction in corporate overheads. Even if revenues were down, profits could rise on extreme cost-cutting.The result, of course, was fireworks. The $85.5 million in saved expenses would turn the company’s expected $48.5 million loss into a $48.2 million surprise profit. And though rank-and-file workers complain about the $8.25 per hour they make, Reddit investors are loving every moment of it.It’s a classic Wall Street playbook that other managers have used before. Come in with a new CEO… cut staff… upsell the most profitable items… and attempt to manage cash flows with careful inventory control. We’ve seen this at other “sunset” retailers like Gap (NYSE:GPS) that try to extract as much value as possible before their business disappears entirely.Even Elon Musk has arguably used these tactics to preserve cash at Twitter. But that’s another story.What’s GameStop’s Game Plan?Ordinarily, shareholders should be ecstatic about GameStop’s wind-down plans. The company embarked on its “managed decline” path in 2016 after its forays into online gaming and game development failed. Its acquisition of browser-based game firm Kongregate was sold in 2017 for $55 million, and the current cost-cutting by Furlong is an extension of that strategy.Story continuesIt’s a path that has enriched shareholders before. DVD kiosk company Redbox Entertainment pulled this feat off magnificently — milking its locations for cash before selling out to private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) for $1.6 billion. Even Gap has done a remarkable job. Since 2010, the struggling retailer has distributed $13 billion back to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The firm is now worth only $3.5 billion on public markets.But GameStop’s high share price makes that option less viable. Even if the company managed to pump out $127 million in free cash flow by 2025, the declining use of physical game discs means that 3-stage DCF models price GameStop shares at only $5.40. The company would need around $600 million in annual free cash flow to justify its $7.5 billion market capitalization.The Slow Wind-DownSuch wind-downs also have long-term costs. In Q4, GameStop spent just $11.6 million on store upkeep, about half of the $21.3 million they spent in Q4 2021. It’s a short-term way to save cash that eventually becomes more significant expenses later.The lack of store upkeep also makes the physical locations less attractive to customers. It’s why Sears Holdings and Tuesday Morning eventually went under. Customers might put up with aging stores for a while, but my experience as a retail analyst has taught me that retailers hit a tipping point around the 8- to 10-year mark. Once stores are neglected for longer than that, customers will stop showing up. People will put up with broken air conditioners and moldy rugs for only so long.GameStop has also slowed the development of its more “moonshot” ambitions. The company is no longer recruiting for any Web 3.0 or NFT positions, and its NFT trading platform has remained in beta for months.“We’re going to aggressively pursue further cost containment, efficiency, profitability and pragmatic growth in the categories where we can consistently delight our customers,” Mr. Furlong said in his Q4 earnings call. Not exactly a call for hypergrowth projects.GME Stock: It’s 2018 All Over AgainBetween June 2012 and October 2013, shares of GameStop rose over 225% as the company promised new avenues of growth. The firm had just completed several splashy acquisitions, including Spawn Labs, a tech startup that allowed users to play video games in the cloud. The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer also bought a digital game distribution firm that could have competed with Valve’s Steam Games.These dreams, however, failed to work out. By 2017, CEO J. Paul Raines had resigned from the firm for health reasons. GameStop would then see a revolving door of leaders tasked with shrinking the firm. Over the next three years, the firm returned over $1 billion to stakeholders through dividends and retirements of stock and debt.Investors might have felt a sense of deja vu in 2021, when activist investor Ryan Cohen replaced much of the company’s board and management with executives promising growth. And they would have seen history repeat itself as GameStop went from pushing NFTs and Web 3.0 gaming to cutting costs by 15%.GameStop’s “new” direction looks much like its old one. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Mr. Cohen had met with Furlong in 2022 to “abandon the e-commerce plan, shore up cash and focus on stores.”And unless its management can find new growth streams, shareholders should expect more of the same buybacks and corporate shrinking that has defined so much of GME’s recent past.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
