STLD, Ternium S.A. TX and Olympic Steel, Inc. ZEUS.Industry: SteelLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2074682/4-top-steel-producer-stocks-to-play-the-industry-strengthThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is poised to ride on a recovery in demand in automotive, a major market, as the semiconductor crisis gradually eases and automakers ramp up production. The sizable infrastructure investment also augurs well for the U.S. steel industry. The companies in this space are also expected to benefit from a rebound in steel prices.A resilient non-residential construction market and healthy demand in the energy space also act as tailwinds for the industry. Players from the industry like Nucor Corporation, Steel Dynamics, Inc., Ternium S.A. and Olympic Steel, Inc. are well-placed to gain from these trends.About the IndustryThe Zacks Steel Producers industry serves a vast spectrum of end-use industries such as automotive, construction, appliance, container, packaging, industrial machinery, mining equipment, transportation, and oil and gas with various steel products. These products include hot-rolled and cold-rolled coils and sheets, hot-dipped and galvanized coils and sheets, reinforcing bars, billets and blooms, wire rods, strip mill plates, standard and line pipe, and mechanical tubing products.Steel is primarily produced using two methods — Blast Furnace and Electric Arc Furnace. It is regarded as the backbone of the manufacturing industry. The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. Notably, the housing and construction sector is the biggest consumer of steel, accounting for roughly half of the world’s total consumption.What's Shaping the Future of the Steel Producers' Industry?Demand Strength in Major End-use Markets: Steel producers are set to gain from strong demand across major steel end-use markets such as automotive, construction and machinery. They are expected to benefit from higher-order booking from the automotive market in 2023. Steel demand in automotive is expected to improve this year on the back of an easing of a global shortage in semiconductor chips that weighed heavily on the automotive industry for nearly two years.Story continuesLow dealer inventories and pent-up demand should also be supporting factors. Order activities in the non-residential construction market remain strong, underscoring the inherent strength of this industry. Demand in the energy sector has improved on the back of strength in oil and gas prices. Favorable trends across these markets augur well for the steel industry.Auto Recovery, Infrastructure Spending to Drive Steel Prices: Steel prices witnessed a sharp correction globally in 2022 as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, skyrocketing energy costs in Europe, persistently high inflation, interest rate hikes and the slowdown in China due to new COVID-19 lockdowns dwindled demand for steel across key end-use markets. Notably, U.S. steel prices tumbled after surging to roughly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war.The benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices cratered to near the $600 per short ton level in November 2022. The downward drift partly reflects weaker demand and fears of a recession. However, HRC prices have rebounded lately to above $1,000 per short ton, driven by U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions, low import levels, supply tightness partly due to mill outages and a recovery in demand.A rebound in automotive demand is also expected to boost steel prices this year. The massive infrastructure development project should also act as a catalyst for the American steel industry and U.S. HRC prices in 2023. The sizable federal infrastructure spending should favor the U.S. steel industry, given the expected rise in consumption of the commodity.Slowdown in China a Worry: Steel demand in China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity, has softened since the second half of 2021 due to a slowdown in the country’s economy. A downturn in the country’s real estate sector contributed to the slowdown. New lockdowns are also taking a significant toll on the world’s second-largest economy.A slowdown in manufacturing activities has led to a contraction in demand for steel in China. The manufacturing sector has taken a beating as the virus resurgence has hurt demand for manufactured goods and supply chains. China has also seen a slowdown across the construction and property sectors. The country’s real estate sector has taken a hard hit from repeated lockdowns. The slowdown in these key steel-consuming sectors is expected to hurt demand for steel over the short term.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Upbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #33, which places it at the top 13% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

However, HRC prices have rebounded lately to above $1,000 per short ton, driven by U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions, low import levels, supply tightness partly due to mill outages and a recovery in demand. A rebound in automotive demand is also expected to boost steel prices this year. The massive infrastructure development project should also act as a catalyst for the American steel industry and U.S. HRC prices in 2023. The sizable federal infrastructure spending should favor the U.S. steel industry, given the expected rise in consumption of the commodity.Slowdown in China a Worry: Steel demand in China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity, has softened since the second half of 2021 due to a slowdown in the country’s economy. A downturn in the country’s real estate sector contributed to the slowdown. New lockdowns are also taking a significant toll on the world’s second-largest economy. A slowdown in manufacturing activities has led to a contraction in demand for steel in China. The manufacturing sector has taken a beating as the virus resurgence has hurt demand for manufactured goods and supply chains. China has also seen a slowdown across the construction and property sectors. The country’s real estate sector has taken a hard hit from repeated lockdowns. The slowdown in these key steel-consuming sectors is expected to hurt demand for steel over the short term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Upbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. BlackRock (BLK) earns a Zacks Rank #2 nine days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 14, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $8.23 a share.BlackRock's Earnings ESP sits at 4.16%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $8.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.90.BLK is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Unum (UNM) as well.Unum, which is readying to report earnings on May 4, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.67 a share, and UNM is 29 days out from its next earnings report.For Unum, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 is 2.83%.Story continuesBLK and UNM's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

11,ef4d5645-d634-3c10-890f-ba3eda58afcf,UNM,2023-04-06,4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Garner Superior Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-price-cash-flow-125112278.html,1680699072,STORY,"['ABG', 'UNM', 'GM', 'PVH']","[We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. PVH Corp. PVH, Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM and Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. ABG boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:PVH Corp., which operates as an apparel company, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 16.1% for three-five years.

12,f46a55aa-efa1-300c-8c20-fa3c494dd855,STT,2023-04-06,How to Maximize Your Retirement Portfolio with These Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/maximize-retirement-portfolio-top-ranked-131001182.html,1680700201,STORY,['STT'],"[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Bank OZK (OZK) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.35 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.06%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.9% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.75%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 13.33%. Check Bank OZK (OZK) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;State Street Corporation (STT) is paying out a dividend of $0.63 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.38% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 4.44% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 10.53% over the past year. Check State Street Corporation (STT) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.23 per share, TowneBank (TOWN) has a dividend yield of 3.57%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 15%. Check TowneBank (TOWN) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:16% = US$7.0b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo begin with, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Thermo Fisher Scientific's exceptional 27% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 29% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Thermo Fisher Scientific fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 5.9% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (94%) of its profits. So it looks like Thermo Fisher Scientific is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, Thermo Fisher Scientific is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 4.9%. Still, forecasts suggest that Thermo Fisher Scientific's future ROE will rise to 26% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 2, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.04 a share.ZBRA has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.06%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.04 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.92.ZBRA is part of a big group of Industrial Products stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Cintas (CTAS) as well.Cintas is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 13, 2023.

To save more, find out some of the worst items you can buy at Walmart.Boumen Japet / Shutterstock.com1. Wrapping PaperWhether you're in need of wrapping paper for a birthday gift, wedding present or Christmas surprise, you can save big by skipping Walmart and heading to the Dollar Store. Walmart charges $8.49 for one roll of a plain-colored wrapping paper. You can pick up a roll for only $1.25 at the Dollar Tree.Cora Mueller / Shutterstock.com2. Party SuppliesWhether you're hosting a graduation party, an anniversary celebration or a baby shower, Walmart might be the first place you consider for party supplies. But if you're also hosting on a budget, you'll do better heading to the nearest dollar store.""Party supplies at Walmart can be up to five times the cost of party supplies at dollar stores,"" said Carson Yarbrough, a consumer insights specialist for Offers.com, a site for coupons and insider savings tips. ""If you're planning a party, opt to get party supplies like plastic cups, decorations and balloons at the dollar store to see significant savings.""Milosz_G / Shutterstock.com3. ToysThere's nothing more exciting than watching your little one jump for joy when given a new toy, but you don't need to pay more to experience that same reaction. The Thomas &amp; Friends Fix 'em Up Friends Toy Train Set costs $39.99 at Walmart, but you can save on it by buying it at Target for $18.99.Nikhom / Shutterstock.com4. Wood FurnitureFurniture can be expensive. So, if you're just starting out or looking for inexpensive pieces for your home, you might be lured by Walmart's low prices on wood furniture. Keep in mind, however, that you get what you pay for at these prices.Story continues""Walmart has relatively cheap wood furniture, but this is because it's a lesser quality than other furniture retailers,"" said Yarbrough. ""Wooden furniture from Walmart is more likely to break or deteriorate quicker, so buy your furniture elsewhere to save money and the hassle of replacing it in two months.""VGstockstudio / Shutterstock.com5. ShampooMany of us love to give our locks the luxury treatment with salon-quality shampoos and conditioners. However, shampoo is one of the items you should buy on Amazon instead of Walmart.At Walmart, 33.8 ounces of Nexxus Therappe Moisture Shampoo costs $25.98, but you'll pay $24.72 with free shipping on Amazon. You can use those savings to purchase some new hair ties to replace the ones you're always losing.franckreporter / iStock.com6. PhotosAlthough Walmart offers a decent price of 12 cents per photo print, you can do better. There are several apps that give you the opportunity to order copies of your favorite photos for free. Shutterfly, for example, gets you started with unlimited free prints when you download its app. There's also an app called FreePrints that makes ordering pictures as easy as 1-2-3, and it also provides services free of charge. Customers simply pay for shipping, which still makes the purchase much cheaper than buying prints from Walmart.Nomad_Soul / Shutterstock.com7. BatteriesCrucial for operating everything from toys to remote controls, batteries are a must-have item around the house. The problem with Walmart, however, is that you'll likely spend a lot on batteries and get little in return.Right now, the retailer offers a four-pack of Energizer Ultimate AA Lithium Batteries for $14.76. But if you buy in bulk at Sam's Club, you'll get an 18-pack of the batteries for $34.98.NOBUHIRO ASADA / Shutterstock.com8. CoffeeMost people can't get their days started without a cup of joe. Because coffee is relatively inexpensive, you might not question Walmart's prices. But the truth is, competitors like Amazon typically sell the same brands of coffee for less.For example, Walmart's price for Maxwell House Original Roast Ground Coffee (30.6 ounces) is $10.46, but the coffee is sold at Amazon for $9.36.uatp2 / iStock.com9. Mini-RefrigeratorsMany prospective college students head to Walmart to get items for their dorm rooms. This can include a minifridge for always having a cold drink on hand. Unfortunately, Walmart isn't the best place to get this appliance. Parents can save a significant amount of money by taking a few minutes to shop around. For example, if you purchased the Magic Chef 4.4 cubic feet Refrigerator at Walmart, you'd have to pay $355.59. After a little digging, you'd discover Home Depot sells the same minifridge for $249. That's a savings of over $100.bhofack2 / Getty Images10. Vitafusion MultiVitesVitamin supplements can treat nutritional deficiencies, and some vitamins even improve the outlook for certain health conditions. But the cost of vitamins can add up over time, so it's important to find ways to save money. Rather than purchase vitamins from Walmart, compare prices to see if you can find your selections cheaper on Amazon.You'll save on Vitafusion MultiVites gummy vitamins, for example, when shopping on Amazon. A pack of two 150-count bottle is listed on Amazon for $21.90, whereas Walmart sells a single bottle for $12.47. You save $1.52 on each bottle buying from Amazon.Rob Hainer / Shutterstock.com11. KeurigYou'll also save money by skipping Walmart and purchasing your Keurig K55 Brewer from another retailer. Walmart has this particular Keurig model for $169.96. For a cheaper option, head to Amazon where you'll find the same model for $109.99.Sorbis / Shutterstock.com12. Gift CardsWalmart's gift card center features a generous selection of restaurants and retailers, including Olive Garden, Papa John's, Starbucks and Burger King. Plus, there's the option to buy Visa, MasterCard and American Express gift cards. Walmart is a convenient place to pick up cards, but it isn't the cheapest place.A cost-saving solution involves buying from discount sites like Raise and Cardpool, which have gift cards for up to 30% and 35% off, respectively.kavee29 / Shutterstock.com13. Straight Talk WirelessWith a prepaid or pay-as-you-go cellphone plan, you don't have to worry about a contract. And, you only pay for the minutes you use.Walmart's Straight Talk wireless is an affordable cellular solution, with its $55 monthly unlimited nationwide plan and 4G LTE data. This monthly price might agree with your wallet, it's certainly not the best deal in town. If you buy this same plan through Straight Talk Wireless' website, you can get the first three months at $50 per month when you automatically refill it.Daria Minaeva / Shutterstock.com14. Basic Kitchen ItemsWalmart has a huge selection of kitchenware from drinking glasses to cooking items. But if you're on the hunt for simple, inexpensive kitchen merchandise like coffee mugs, flatware or bowls, there's no need to pay big retailer prices. Dollar stores might have exactly what you're looking for at a cheaper price.Why pay $5 for a basic coffee mug at Walmart when you can get mugs for $1 each at dollar stores?Most people want to save money. But just because a company claims to be the cheapest retailer on the block doesn't mean it's true. Even with Walmart coupons, you can potentially save elsewhere. With that being said, do your homework, shop around and compare prices at retailers -- your wallet will thank you.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterPrices are accurate as of April 5, 2023.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 14 Items To Avoid at Walmart]"

The company highlighted its push into automation as well as how inflation is changing consumer buying habits.Speaking with Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith, CFRA Analyst Arun Sundaram says that while the company focusing on growing profitability, labor costs will remain a pressure point through the end of 2023.KEY VIDEO MOMENTS0:13 Walmart increasing wages0:43 Wage pressure lower compared to last few years1:07 Walmart becoming an 'omnichannel retailer'1:53 Alternative profit streamsVideo TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Arun, how big of a factor are labor costs right now? Is that still a pressure point here for Walmart?ARUN SUNDARAM: Yeah, that's been a pressure point for several years. And it's going to be another pressure point for this year. It was just a few months ago, Walmart announced that they're increasing wages for their US associates this year. I believe this the average hourly wage will now be over $17.50. And the minimum wage is now $14 an hour for their store employees.And they're also increasing benefits for their store employees, things like extended health care coverage, tuition reimbursement, things like that. But I think the good news is that, although wage pressures continue to exist, it's probably going to be less of a headwind this year than it was the past few years.I think that it's slowly becoming less of headwind. But albeit it is still is a headwind.SEANA SMITH: Arun, what's the one thing that you think Walmart needs to do to succeed and help maybe why didn't that gap or stay-- at least stay ahead of some of its rivals out there?ARUN SUNDARAM: Yeah, I think it's really about becoming a true omnichannel retailer. Many people still only shop inside Walmart stores, inside their physical stores. But now they're really doubling down on both their in-store business and their online business.For their online business, they don't want to be just a first party marketplace. They also want to be a large third party marketplace, similar to an Amazon. And they're really trying to-- they're kind of copying Amazon's playbook in that regard and trying to expand their online marketplace.They also introduced a subscription-based program called Walmart+. They're trying to attract more higher-income, affluent customers to that subscription model, similar to Amazon's Prime model. And I think as they grow this online marketplace, that will bode well for both their in-store sales, their online sales, and also these alternative profit streams that I was talking about before.The more sellers they attract to their online business, the more buyers they attract to the online business, the more likely advertisers are going to want to advertise on walmart.com. And that's a way, I think, they're going to grow margins over the long term.]"

As far as the impact on the top line, he said, ""Our targeted 4% compounded growth implies that over the next five years we'll add more than $130 billion of sales on top of our $600 billion base today.""As Walmart looks to compete with Amazon (AMZN), known for fast delivery, the retail giant thinks that its automated fulfillment centers could set a new precedent.At the meeting, U.S. President and CEO John Furner said he thinks these new fulfillment centers ""can double the number of orders we are able to fulfill in a day, which means packages arrive at customer's doorstep faster than ever before.""This announcement comes after Walmart recently went through layoffs at five of its U.S. e-commerce warehouses, affecting more than 2,000 positions.Walmart is trying to make the case that this major investment in automation will actually results in more, higher-paying jobs and keep its headcount nearly flat.Furner said automation will result in less manual labor. ""Over-time, we’ll have the same number of associates, possibly even more, but we’ll have a larger business and they’ll be new roles that’ll emerge that are more technical…and they’ll pay more,” he said.North Miami Beach, Florida, Walmart discount department store, checkout line, cashier with customer paying . (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images)CFRA Analyst Arun Sundaram (who holds a Buy rating on the stock) said Walmart will likely try to turn the job cuts in its favor.Story continues""A lot of these lower-level jobs will be cut, but they'll redirect these employees to other jobs that require less manual labor. They're expecting, also, to increase their employee retention, now that less strenuous jobs, less manual labor and more of those higher paying jobs will be available.""Meanwhile, labor costs remain a pressure point for the retail giant, according to D.A. Davidson Senior Research Analyst Michael Baker, but ""less so this year than they were last year.""Furner said over the last five years, its hourly wage is up approximately 30%. At the end of January of this year, Walmart announced plans to increase its average hourly pay to more than $17.50, making the range now $14 to $19 per hour.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

When we see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) in conjunction with a declining base of capital employed, that's often how a mature business shows signs of aging. This reveals that the company isn't compounding shareholder wealth because returns are falling and its net asset base is shrinking. So after we looked into Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), the trends above didn't look too great.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Nordstrom:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.095 = US$545m ÷ (US$8.7b - US$3.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).So, Nordstrom has an ROCE of 9.5%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Multiline Retail industry average of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Nordstrom compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Nordstrom.The Trend Of ROCEThere is reason to be cautious about Nordstrom, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 19% that they were earning five years ago. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. This combination can be indicative of a mature business that still has areas to deploy capital, but the returns received aren't as high due potentially to new competition or smaller margins. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Nordstrom to turn into a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Investors haven't taken kindly to these developments, since the stock has declined 63% from where it was five years ago. That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere.Nordstrom does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Nordstrom  that you might be interested in.While Nordstrom isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

By assessing the relative effectiveness of each control, organizations are now able to allocate resources towards those that provide the best protection, better position their risk with insurers, and build their cyber resiliency more confidently.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230406005089/en/According to a new Marsh McLennan report, these five controls, among the 12 key control categories commonly required by cyber insurers, were determined to have the greatest ability to decrease the likelihood of a successful cyberattack. (Graphic: Business Wire)According to the report, Using data to prioritize cybersecurity investments, automated hardening techniques were found, by a wide margin, to have the greatest ability of any control studied to decrease the likelihood of a successful cyberattack. Organizations with such techniques in place, which apply baseline security configurations to system components like servers and operating systems, are nearly six times less likely to have a cyber incident than those that do not.The finding is surprising, the report notes, given that until now, the three controls most frequently recommended by insurers have been endpoint detection and response (EDR), multifactor authentication (MFA), and privileged access management (PAM).The analysis also shows that MFA, long a staple among cybersecurity tools and recommendations, only works when it is in place for all critical and sensitive data, for all remote login access, and for administrator account access. Organizations with such broad implementation are 1.4 times less likely to experience a successful cyberattack than those that do not.Story continuesAdditionally, patching high severity vulnerabilities across the enterprise within seven days of the patch’s release ties as the fourth most effective control – decreasing an organization’s probability of experiencing a cyber event by a factor of 2, yet it is has the lowest implementation rate among organizations studied, at only 24%, the report found.""All of the key controls in our study are well-known best practices, commonly required by underwriters to obtain cyber insurance. However, many organizations are unsure which controls to adopt and rely on expert opinions rather than data to make decisions,"" said Tom Reagan, US and Canada Cyber Practice Leader, Marsh. ""Our research provides organizations the data they need to more effectively direct cybersecurity investments, which in turn, helps favorably position them during the cyber insurance underwriting process. It is another step toward building not only a more resilient cyber insurance market, but also a more cyber resilient economy.""For the report, Marsh McLennan paired its extensive proprietary dataset of cyber claims with the results from Marsh Cybersecurity Self-Assessment (CSA) questionnaires, which are composed of hundreds of questions and responses from individual organizations. Based on the correlation, data scientists calculated and assigned a ""signal strength"" to each control. The higher the signal strength, the greater the impact the control has on decreasing the likelihood of an event.Among the hundreds of cyber capabilities, tools, and implementation techniques analyzed and measured, the report focuses only on those falling within the 12 key control categories commonly required by cyber insurers. Among those, the top five controls determined most effective are:Key control categorySignal strengthHardening techniquesSystem configuration management tools, such as active directory group policy, which enforce and redeploy configuration settings to systems5.58Privileged access managementManaging desktop or local administrator privileges via endpoint privilege management (EPM)2.92Endpoint detection and responseOperating advanced endpoint security2.23Logging and monitoringOperating a security operations center (SOC) and/or having an outsourced managed security service provider (MSSP) with the following capabilities at a minimum:a.

(NYSE:MET) would have made a tidy sum after selling US$593k worth of stock at a high price",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-metlife-inc-nyse-met-120220289.html,1680782540,STORY,['MET'],"[Despite the fact that MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) stock rose 3.8% last week, insiders who sold US$593k worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$74.18, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for MetLife The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MetLifeIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Head of Global Technology &amp; Operations, Bill Pappas, sold US$378k worth of shares at a price of US$75.55 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$58.66. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year MetLife insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like MetLife better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of MetLifeLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.2% of MetLife shares, worth about US$89m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About MetLife Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Still, the insider transactions at MetLife in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for MetLife you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.But note: MetLife may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

35,201243bc-858a-3b7f-81a2-dee94c87a464,IT,2023-04-06,Why We Like The Returns At Gartner (NYSE:IT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-returns-gartner-nyse-100746679.html,1680775666,STORY,['IT'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Gartner (NYSE:IT) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Gartner:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$7.3b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Gartner has an ROCE of 31%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the IT industry average of 11%. Check out our latest analysis for Gartner roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Gartner compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Gartner.So How Is Gartner's ROCE Trending?Gartner has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 825% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 49% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. Given it's pretty high ratio, we'd remind investors that having current liabilities at those levels can bring about some risks in certain businesses.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo sum it up, Gartner is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Since the stock has returned a staggering 169% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Gartner can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Gartner does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Meanwhile, Brazil, traditionally a U.S. naphtha importer, is boosting purchases from Russia at more attractive prices.However, the journey from Russia to Brazil can take 18 days or longer and, at up to $7 million per voyage, the costs are nearly double that of a U.S. shipment, the ship charterer involved in the Russian market said.Brazil received around 240,000 tonnes of Russian diesel and gasoil in the first three weeks of March, accounting for a quarter of Brazilian imports, up from Russia's 12% share in February and less than 1% last year, said Benedict George, head of diesel pricing with energy and commodity data provider Argus.""Until February, Europe had remained Russia's primary market for refined product exports; however, in the space of a month, a major pivot has been observed,"" tanker broker E A Gibson said in a recent report.LONGER DISTANCES, MORE POLLUTIONMeasured in terms of cargo miles, which multiplies the cargo quantity in metric tonnes by the distance travelled in nautical miles, the amount of Russian oil product shipments to Brazil in March rose to 3.07 billion metric tonne-nautical miles (MT-NM) from 941 million MT-NM in November, according to data from valuation company VesselsValue. Shipments from Russia to Nigeria rose to 1.88 billion MT-NM in March from zero in November, VesselsValue estimates showed.Clean product cargoes to Saudi Arabia in March jumped to 1.75 billion MT-NM from 31 million MT-NM in November, while shipments to the United Arab Emirates were 4.43 billion MT-NM in March, up from 2.85 billion MT-NM in November, the data showed.Also in March, Russian clean products shipped to Togo reached 973 million MT-NM, up from zero in November. In volume terms, Brazilian imports of oil products from Russia were about 284,000 metric tonnes in February, up from 73,300 tonnes in September, VesselsValue data showed. Conversely, Russian exports to the Netherlands dropped to 238,200 tonnes in February from 1.15 million tonnes in September.Those longer distances are being done at higher costs for Russian products than for typical shipments from Europe.According to market estimates, freight rates for the UK/European continent to West Africa are quoted at $55.77 per tonne for a product tanker with a standard 37,000-tonne load. This compares with an indicative rate of $174.24 per tonne for shipments from Russia's Baltic ports to Nigeria, $103.84 for Morocco and around $150 to Egypt.With ships travelling further, that is also likely translating into greater emissions from smokestacks.Based on pre-pandemic data, a 10% increase in mileage for all tankers travelling to and from the European economic area would increase their emissions by around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equal to the emissions of around 750,000 cars per year in Europe, said Valentin Simon, data analyst with the Transport &amp; Environment think tank in Brussels.(Reporting by Mohi Narayan in New Delhi, Jonathan Saul and Shadia Nasralla in London, additional reporting by Trixie Yap in Singapore and Natalia Chumakova in Moscow; Editing by Tony Munroe and Christian Schmollinger)]"

Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""Our plan will build on the significant enhancements we've made to reinforce the grid against progressively stronger storms,"" said Patricia Mullin, acting president of FirstEnergy's Ohio operations. ""We're committed to making the right investments to ensure a modern, more reliable grid while also keeping electric bills affordable, and we will continue working with interested stakeholders to ensure an open and thorough review of our proposal.""Utilities in Ohio are required to file plans to establish electric service for their customers. FirstEnergy's plan – the company's fifth ESP – maintains an auction process to determine the pricing and supply of electricity for customers who rely on their company for all aspects of their electric service. While the ESP preserves the ability for customers to select their own energy supplier, enhancements to the auction process are proposed to help ensure competitively priced electricity for those who do not shop by increasing interest in the auction from energy suppliers while minimizing their risk.The eight-year ESP term would begin June 1, 2024, through May 31, 2032. The plan supports additional investments in the distribution system, including grid modernization, maintenance such as storm restoration work and increased tree trimming, energy efficiency programs and bill assistance measures that aim to keep customers' needs and expectations top of mind. The plan includes:Story continuesMeasures to support the companies' continued investment in the electric distribution system. These include investments in grid modernization, such as the companies' $626 million Grid Modernization II proposal which was submitted in July 2022 and is pending PUCO approval.Provisions to enable the companies' continued maintenance of the distribution grid, including an enhanced tree-trimming program to accelerate removal of trees and brush that can cause power outages. The plan would help reduce outages caused by trees outside the companies' rights-of-way, which are a leading contributor to outages during major weather events.New energy efficiency programs for residential and commercial customers to help them save energy, reduce their bills and ease their environmental impact.Commitment to spend $52 million over the eight-year term of the ESP, without recovery from customers, on initiatives to assist customers and enhance the customer experience. These include low-income bill payment assistance programs, a new senior citizen electric bill discount program, educational efforts to support deployment of electric vehicles and funding to deploy energy storage supporting the distribution system.If the ESP is approved, the average FirstEnergy Ohio residential customer using 750 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month could expect to see an initial increase of approximately $3.11, or 2.2%, on their electric bill. Over the eight-year term of the plan, the estimated average annual impact to these customers' bills is an increase of 0.5%.Ohio Edison serves more than one million customers across 34 Ohio counties.

Wall Street analysts expect an EPS of $2.01 and revenue of $27.65 billion.As always, InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Start your free 7-day trial to get on board.First Citizens Bancshares reached all-time high following UBS double-upgradeFirst Citizens BancShares (NASDAQ:FCNCA) surged over 4% on Wednesday to reach an all-time high, after UBS double-upgraded the stock to Buy from Sell and raised its price target to $1,206 from $538. This came after last week’s announcement of the company's acquisition of $72B of assets held by the Silicon Valley Bridge Bank at a discount of $16.5B, which resulted in a share price jump of more than 53% on March 27.UBS argues that tangible book value per share (TBVPS) accretion should be a positive catalyst for a further re-rate. ""We increased our 2024E EPS to $141.36 from $86.01, and our YE2023 tangible book value per share (TBVPS) to ~$1,423 from ~$659 due to the acquisition,” said the firm.Story continuesSealed Air upgraded to buy as volume inflection nearsSealed Air (NYSE:SEE) shares rose more than 2% today after UBS upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $59.00, noting that volumes should inflect with normalizing customer demand.Supply chain issues such as those with resin and equipment parts, combined with a post-COVID demand reset and industrial destocking, resulted in negative volume trends over the past year. However, the firm anticipates a positive inflection in volumes beginning in Q3/23. This is expected to boost confidence in the company’s growth algorithm, and UBS models a long-term approximately 13% EPS CAGR, which makes the stock undeserving of the current valuation discount.3 more upgradesSLM (NASDAQ:SLM) shares surged more than 5% yesterday after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to Overweight from Underweight and raised its price target to $15.00 from $14.00 on better-than-feared credit quality.The firm raised its EPS estimates for 2023/2024 by 11%/5% as SLM's credit performance has improved over the past several months, while the rest of the group's credit quality is declining. According to the firm, this is mainly due to one-time transitory issues that impacted performance in 2022, which have now eased.Wedbush upgraded  Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $37, highlighting a higher probability of upside to $125M 2023 AEBITDA guidance.Although aggressive near-term consensus expectations do not reflect management's internal expectations and messaging, Wedbush considers the 2023 AEBITDA guidance as conservative and realistic.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.25%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.24%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.88%.Coming into today, shares of the energy company had gained 0.27% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector lost 3.35%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.48%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Marathon Oil as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 3, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Marathon Oil to post earnings of $0.67 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 34.31%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.7 billion, down 2.99% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.11 per share and revenue of $7.04 billion. These totals would mark changes of -30.58% and -12.44%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 13.93% lower within the past month. Marathon Oil currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesInvestors should also note Marathon Oil's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 8.28. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.62, so we one might conclude that Marathon Oil is trading at a discount comparatively.We can also see that MRO currently has a PEG ratio of 0.37. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.51 at yesterday's closing price.The Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Juniper Networks is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that JNPR has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.08, while MSI has a forward P/E of 25.58. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 2.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.84.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.48. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MSI has a P/B of 364.91.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, JNPR holds a Value grade of B, while MSI has a Value grade of C.JNPR sticks out from MSI in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that JNPR is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A source familiar with the matter said it would likely take several days to assess the contents of the letter.OpenAI, which is based in San Francisco, did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's statement.On Thursday, the company published a blog post, titled ""Our approach to AI safety"", which said it was working to develop ""nuanced policies against behavior that represents a genuine risk to people.""""We don’t use data for selling our services, advertising, or building profiles of people,"" it said. ""We use data to make our models more helpful for people. ChatGPT, for instance, improves by further training on the conversations people have with it.""While some of our training data includes personal information that is available on the public internet, we want our models to learn about the world, not private individuals.""Story continuesThe company said it removed personal information from its datasets where possible, fine-tuned models to reject user prompts asking for such information, and would respond to individual requests to delete their data from its systems.The ban by Italy has piqued the interest of other privacy regulators in Europe who are studying if harsher measures are needed for chatbots and whether to coordinate such actions.In February, Garante banned AI chatbot company Replika from using the personal data of Italian users, citing risks to minors and emotionally fragile people.

Operational efficiency and reduced expenses on the back of a successful work-from-home trend and the hybrid working model have been driving competitive advantage besides increasing innovation and speed to market. The buoyancy in the industry is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank #58, which places it in the top 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries.However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Over the past three months, the industry has declined 6.2% against the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 6.4% appreciation and 2.8% rise of the broader Zacks Business Services sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven this backdrop, let’s focus on some outsourcing stocks — Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. BR — which have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus reflecting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

73,8a6c12bc-01b1-3563-b4bc-1ccd0d208518,SBUX,2023-04-06,MCD Vs SBUX: Which Stock is Better Placed at the Moment?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcd-vs-sbux-stock-better-151803681.html,1680707883,STORY,"['SBUX', 'MCD', 'ARCO']","[The restaurant industry is benefiting from improvement in demand, menu innovation, robust off-premise sales, sales-building efforts and digital initiatives. However, high wages and food cost inflation remain major concerns.Restaurant operators’ focus on digital innovation, sales-building initiatives and cost-saving efforts has been acting as a catalyst. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats, and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth. Restaurant operators are focusing on driverless delivery systems to augment sales amid the COVID-19 crisis. This is anticipated to reduce expenses substantially and ensure safety amid the pandemic as companies do away with delivery personnel.However, the restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time now. A rapid increase in menu prices and COVID-19 are the primary reasons behind traffic erosion. Restaurant operators are grappling with high costs of operations.Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation are concerning. The industry is persistently bearing increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure the company’s margins. The rise in meat and seafood costs, including ribs, prime rib, ribeye, tri-tip and salmon, is hurting the industry.In line with the industry's growth, leading restaurant companies — McDonald's Corporation MCD and Starbucks Corporation SBUX — are trying out different strategies to generate profits. With both companies carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let's analyze and find out which is poised better with respect to different parameters.Price Performance and ValuationShares of McDonald's have gained 12.3% in the past year, whereas Starbucks stock has risen 24.8%.On the basis of the forward 12-month P/E ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing restaurant stocks, the industry is currently trading at 25.45X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 19.52X. McDonald's has an edge with a lower forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.17 than Starbucks' figure of 27.79X.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Estimated Earnings &amp; RevenuesArguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance in determining a stock's potential, as surging profit levels indicate strong prospects (and stock price gains).For the current year, McDonald's earnings per share and sales are expected to improve 3.9% and 4.7%, respectively, year over year. Starbucks’ earnings per share and sales are likely to increase 15.2% and 11.2%, respectively, year over year. Hence, this round goes to Starbucks.FundamentalsMcDonald’s believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding its presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance.Despite unfavorable scenario, the company continues to expand its global footprint. It is planning to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023, including 400 in the United States and IOM segment, and 1,500 (including nearly 900 in China) in the IDL market. The company expects net restaurant unit expansion to contribute 1.5% to 2023 systemwide sales growth in constant currencies.The company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In fourth-quarter 2022, global comps advanced 12.6% compared with 12.3% gain reported in the prior-year quarter. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of comps growth.In the fourth quarter, comps in the United States, international operated markets and international developmental licensed segment rose 10.3%, 12.6% and 16.5%, respectively. The company gained from robust performance in Japan and Brazil.Then again, Starbucks is benefiting from expansion efforts. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, Starbucks opened 459 net new stores worldwide, bringing the total store count to 36,170. In fiscal 2023, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The company expects global store growth to be nearly 7%. Capital expenditure in fiscal 2023 are estimated to be $2.5 billion.The company’s North America comps have impressed investors for the eighth straight quarter and rose 14% in the fiscal first quarter. The segment benefited from 10% growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales. Average ticket and transaction increased 9% and 1%, respectively.Despite the dismal performance in China, the company reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2023. Consolidated revenues are anticipated to grow 10-12% on a year-over-year basis. The company anticipates non-GAAP EPS growth to be at the low end of 15-20%.Our TakeThe fundamentals of both companies are solid. However, earnings growth and share price performance provide Starbucks a slight edge over McDonald’s.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO and Bloomin' Brands, Inc. BLMN.Arcos Dorados currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). ARCO has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.8%. Shares of the company have declined 8.3% in the past year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Arcos Dorados’ 2024 sales and EPS suggests growth of 8% and 11.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported levels.Bloomin' Brands flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 at present. BLMN has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.3%. The stock has risen 23% in the past year.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bloomin' Brands’ 2024 sales and EPS suggests growth of 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ADM, Corteva Inc. CTVA, Adecoagro S.A. AGRO and Limoneira Co LMNR.Industry: Agriculture OperationsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2074751/4-agriculture-operations-stocks-in-focus-amid-wavering-industry-trendsLogistic and supply-chain issues, higher input costs, and elevated operational expenses have been affecting the Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry for a while. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while.Nonetheless, the industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Continued investments in assets and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players likeArcher Daniels Midland Co., Corteva Inc., Adecoagro S.A. and Limoneira Co.About the IndustryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process, and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial products). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology.The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mostly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations IndustryElevated Costs:Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, including constraints in labor and trucking resources, leading to higher lead times for deliveries. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while.The companies have resorted to pricing strategies to counter the rising raw material costs. The industry participants are looking to counter the global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, supply-chain challenges and cost inflation are expected to continue hurting margins in the near term.Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&amp;A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses may continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2023 (ending Sep 30) of $184.5 billion suggest a decline of $5.5 billion from the November forecast of a record $193.5 billion. The export forecasts have been affected by declines in most of the commodity groups, with the largest declines coming from corn, soybeans and sorghum.Corn exports are expected to decline due to lower volumes. Soybean exports are expected to be impacted by tight U.S. supplies and higher competition from Brazil. The export projections for sorghum have halved due to sharply lower U.S. production. Overall grain and feed exports are projected at $43.8 billion, down $2.4 billion from November.China continues to be the largest market for U.S. agricultural exports. While export projections to Mexico have been unchanged, export projections to Canada have declined by $500 million due to lower corn demand.Robust Demand Trends for Organic Products: The industry has been benefiting from an organic movement, prompted by consumers’ increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques, and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry’s growth.Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #214, which places it at the bottom 15% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in a year.The stocks in the industry have collectively fallen 11.9% in a year compared with declines of 8.8% for the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and 2.3% for the sector.Agriculture - Operations Industry's ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 13.63X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.53X and the sector’s 13.63X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 17.44X, as low as 10.24X and at the median of 14.51X.4 Agriculture Operations Stocks to Keep an Eye OnNone of the stocks in the Zacks Agriculture – Operations universe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

Its Readiness program, positive cash flow and solid performance at the Nutrition unit have been aiding the results. The company has been progressing well on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Management is optimistic about the company’s 2022 results and envisions another year of strong earnings growth.

77,f6986509-bd47-3d81-b124-11638ecf7f32,ADM,2023-04-06,4 Agriculture Operations Stocks in Focus Amid Wavering Industry Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-agriculture-operations-stocks-focus-123212022.html,1680697932,STORY,['ADM'],"[Logistic and supply-chain issues, higher input costs, and elevated operational expenses have been affecting the Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry for a while. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while.Nonetheless, the industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Continued investments in assets and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM, Corteva Inc. CTVA, Adecoagro S.A. AGRO and Limoneira Co LMNR.About the IndustryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process, and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial product). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology. The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mostly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.What's Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations IndustryElevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, including constraints in labor and trucking resources, leading to higher lead times for deliveries. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. The companies have resorted to pricing strategies to counter the rising raw material costs. The industry participants are looking to counter the global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, supply-chain challenges and cost inflation are expected to continue hurting margins in the near term.Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&amp;A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses may continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2023 (ending Sep 30) of $184.5 billion suggest a decline of $5.5 billion from the November forecast of a record $193.5 billion. The export forecasts have been affected by declines in most of the commodity groups, with the largest declines coming from corn, soybeans and sorghum. Corn exports are expected to decline due to lower volumes. Soybean exports are expected to be impacted by tight U.S. supplies and higher competition from Brazil. The export projections for sorghum have halved due to sharply lower U.S. production. Overall grain and feed exports are projected at $43.8 billion, down $2.4 billion from November. China continues to be the largest market for U.S. agricultural exports. While export projections to Mexico have been unchanged, export projections to Canada have declined by $500 million due to lower corn demand.Robust Demand Trends for Organic Products: The industry has been benefiting from an organic movement, prompted by consumers’ increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques, and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry’s growth. Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #214, which places it at the bottom 15% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) recently and CEO Aart de Geus deserves a mention for their role in it. Shareholders will have this at the front of their minds in the upcoming AGM on 12th of April. This would also be a chance for them to hear the board review the financial results, discuss future company strategy and vote on any resolutions such as executive remuneration. Here is our take on why we think CEO compensation is not extravagant. View our latest analysis for Synopsys How Does Total Compensation For Aart de Geus Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?Our data indicates that Synopsys, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$58b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$10m for the year to October 2022. That is, the compensation was roughly the same as last year. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$540k.On comparing similar companies in the American Software industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$14m. From this we gather that Aart de Geus is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry. Moreover, Aart de Geus also holds US$158m worth of Synopsys stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$540kUS$540k5%OtherUS$9.5mUS$9.4m95%Total CompensationUS$10mUS$10.0m100%Speaking on an industry level, nearly 9% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 91% is other remuneration. In Synopsys' case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.Story continuesceo-compensationSynopsys, Inc.'s GrowthSynopsys, Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 24% a year over the past three years. It achieved revenue growth of 15% over the last year.Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's a real positive to see this sort of revenue growth in a single year. That suggests a healthy and growing business. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.Has Synopsys, Inc. Been A Good Investment?Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Synopsys, Inc. for providing a total return of 172% over three years. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.In Summary...The company's solid performance might have made most shareholders happy, possibly making CEO remuneration the least of the matters to be discussed in the AGM. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.Shareholders may want to check for free if Synopsys insiders are buying or selling shares.Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the fourth quarter, its Investor Class fund APFWX returned 10.25%, Advisor Class fund APDWX posted a return of 10.23%, and Institutional Class fund APHWX returned 10.24%, compared to a return of 7.56% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Artisan Value Income Fund highlighted stocks like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in the Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a tobacco company. On April 5, 2023, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stock closed at $98.74 per share. One-month return of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was -1.01%, and its shares lost 0.28% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has a market capitalization of $153.259 billion.Artisan Value Income Fund made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless ""reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.""Story continuesPixabay/Public DomainPhilip Morris International Inc.

The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows MA to pursue acquisitions as well as deploy capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past six months (+29.7% vs. +17.0%).

Philip Morris (PM), which belongs to the Zacks Tobacco industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 9.31%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Philip Morris came out with earnings of $1.39 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share, representing a surprise of 7.75%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.38 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.53 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.87%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Philip Morris lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Philip Morris has an Earnings ESP of +4.83% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 20, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your WatchlistFor growth investors, a company's financial strength, overall health, and future outlook take precedence, so they'll want to zero in on the Growth Style Score. This Score examines things like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will generate sustainable growth over time.Philip Morris (PM)Philip Morris International is progressing well with its business transformation in the face of consumers rising health consciousness and stern regulations to dissuade smoking. To this end, the tobacco giant has been expanding in the reduced risk products (RRPs) category, evident from the launch of IQOS (a heating tobacco device) that counts amongst one of the leading RRPs in the industry. We note that RRPs formed 31.4% of the company’s total revenues in second-quarter 2022. Continued rise in revenues from IQOS has been contributing toward RRP’s growth. Nevertheless, the company’s combustible category presently remains its major revenue contributor.PM sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Growth Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. Earnings and sales are forecasted to increase 5.5% and 9.8% year-over-year, respectively.Five analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.30 to $6.31 per share. PM boasts an average earnings surprise of 10.9%.On a historic basis, Philip Morris has generated cash flow growth of 4.2%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 0% this year.Story continuesPM should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive growth fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Growth and VGM Style Scores.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:MAT) Trading At A 33% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mattel-inc-nasdaq-mat-trading-192931610.html,1680722971.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Mattel fair value estimate is US$26.89Mattel is estimated to be 33% undervalued based on current share price of US$18.04 The US$23.13 analyst price target for MAT is 14% less than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Mattel Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$426.2mUS$583.3mUS$679.9mUS$762.9mUS$832.9mUS$891.5mUS$941.0mUS$983.3mUS$1.02bUS$1.05bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 16.56%Est @ 12.21%Est @ 9.17%Est @ 7.04%Est @ 5.55%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.77%Est @ 3.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$387US$480US$507US$516US$511US$496US$474US$450US$423US$396(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.6bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$4.9bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$9.6b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$18.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mattel as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.382. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MattelStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.25% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.24%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.88%.Coming into today, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had lost 6.62% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector lost 3.35%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.48%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Schlumberger as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 21, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.60, up 76.47% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.55 billion, up 26.64% from the year-ago period.SLB's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.02 per share and revenue of $32.74 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +38.53% and +16.54%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Schlumberger is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Schlumberger has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.73 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.1, which means Schlumberger is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that SLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.44. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.56 as of yesterday's close.The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG), which is up 60%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 47% (not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Packaging Corporation of America achieved compound earnings per share growth of 16% per year. We note that the 17% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Packaging Corporation of America has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Packaging Corporation of America, it has a TSR of 76% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Packaging Corporation of America returned a loss of 4.3% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 9.8%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 8% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Packaging Corporation of America (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Also, volatile equity markets may cause a reduction in transaction volumes.Looking at its earnings estimates, it seems that analysts are not very optimistic regarding NTRS’ earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has been revised marginally lower over the past seven days. As a result, NTRS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past six months, shares of the company have lost 1.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s revenues witnessed a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% over the last three years (2020-2022) on rising non-interest income and NII, with some annual volatility. Growth of NII was aided by the improvement in loan balances. In the upcoming quarters, a decent loan pipeline in the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments will position it for organic growth. Moreover, the elimination of fee waivers and the ongoing creation of businesses will propel fee income.Given the increase in its lending book, a favorable balance sheet mix and prevalent high interest rates, Northern Trust's net interest margin is likely to increase.The bank’s credit quality remained decent. Provisions recorded a benefit in 2021 and were only $12 million in 2022. The company has been witnessing improvements in credit quality within the commercial and institutional portfolios. We believe, with the continuation of such a favorable trend in the future, Northern Trust will be able to strengthen its earnings.As of Dec 31, 2022, Northern Trust’s cash and due from banks were $1.73 billion. It maintains investment grade senior debt ratings of A+/A2/A+ and a stable outlook from Fitch, Moody’s and S&amp;P Global, respectively.Story continuesNorthern Trust’s capital deployment activities seem sustainable, given its decent liquidity. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company hiked its third-quarter dividend by 7% to 75 cents per share in July 2022. In October 2021, the company announced a 25-million share repurchase program. Northern Trust repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock in 2022. Such moves will boost shareholder value in the stock.Northern Trust’s expenses continue to rise on higher compensation and increases in equipment and software expenses. We believe that an increasing expense trend on inflation and personnel hires will hinder bottom-line growth in the upcoming quarters.Changing conditions of the global financial markets and general economic conditions could affect NTRS’ businesses. Weak economic conditions affected wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which, in turn, affected the demand for trust and investment products and services. Amid volatile equity markets, a reduction in transaction volumes may affect earnings in the coming quarters.Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are CB Financial Services CBFV and Byline Bancorp BY.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CB Financials' current-year earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.

ILMN recently reached a major milestone by surpassing over 200 orders for its revolutionary NovaSeq X sequencing system in the first quarter of 2023. Strong customer demand drives strong orders.The recent development will further strengthen Illumina’s portfolio of sequencing platforms.More on the NewsNovaSeq X delivers high-throughput sequencing that is twice as fast and three times as accurate as earlier Illumina products. It can generate over 20,000 whole genomes per year at the cost of $200 per genome.In February, scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the first recipient of a NovaSeq X, presented data validating NovaSeq X Plus. The data confirms that NovaSeq X Plus performance meets or exceeds the NovaSeq 6000. This step-change in performance and the launch of Illumina Complete Long Reads (launched in March 2023) allows customers to run long- and short-read sequencing on the same device, offering flexibility in a simplified and efficient workflow.Strong Demand Driving NovSeqX GrowthCustomers are excited about NovaSeq X's ability to allow and advance new projects that require more samples, more multiomic analyses and depth of sequencing. NovaSeq X also offers an entry point for customers seeking more power and faster results.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe NovaSeq X has witnessed the strongest pre-launch demand Illumina has ever witnessed for any instrument, and customer enthusiasm continues to grow. The strong orders represent a varied customer base spanning research and clinical customer segments in about 30 countries across five continents, all seeking to add NovaSeq X — the fastest, most powerful and most sustainable high-throughput sequencer available.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global whole genome sequencing market was valued at $1,645.2 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 20.06% by 2030.  The growing prevalence of genetic disorders and mutations that lead to cancer progression are the main factors driving the market.Story continuesSequencing Growth ContinuesDuring the fourth quarter, Illumina witnessed strong global interest, with orders from more than 25 countries, four times more than in the first quarter of the NovaSeq 6000 launch.  Illumina also witnessed stronger-than-expected clinical adoption and orders from new to high-throughput customers bringing sequencing in-house due to NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits.In mid-throughput, Illumina saw record NextSeq 1K and 2K shipments, up 40% year over year. The upside was driven by the accelerated adoption of multiomics primarily in cancer research and cellular and molecular biology, by new and existing customers. As part of the ongoing innovation road map, the launch of X leap SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1K, 2K remains on track for 2024. The low throughput shipments were up 13% year over year. These instruments continue to provide a great entry point to sequencing.During the fourth quarter, the NovaSeq X has had the strongest pre-order book of any Illumina instrument launch, and this demand will catalyze a multiyear upgrade cycle.Share PriceIn the past six months, Illumina has outperformed its industry.

The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance, along with its solid foothold in the broader MedTech space, is expected to contribute further. However, dependence on third-party suppliers and stiff competition continue to concern the company.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 1.4% compared with 15.9% decline of the industry it belongs to and the S&amp;P 500 composite’s fall of 9.4%.This renowned medical device outsource manufacturer has a market capitalization of $2.54 billion. The company projects 11.6% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Integer Holdings’ earnings yield of 5.4% is favorable to the industry’s negative yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Improving Non-Medical Sales: We are upbeat about Integer Holdings’ improvement in its Non-Medical sales. In the fourth quarter of 2022, revenues at the Non-Medical Sales segment rose 40.9% year over year. The upside was driven by strong sales at the Electrochem product line, part of the Non-Medical segment, across all market segments and incremental sales recovery from the third-quarter supplier delivery issues.Solid Foothold in the Broader MedTech Space: We are optimistic about Integer Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts to increase its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company is also making strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Strong Q4 Results: Integer Holdings’ robust fourth-quarter results raise our optimism. The company registered strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment were also seen. The expansion of both margins bodes well for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: Competition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Many other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: Integer Holdings’ business depends on a continuous supply of raw materials, which may be susceptible to fluctuations due to transportation issues, government regulations and price controls, among others. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, which cannot be recovered through increases in the prices of the company’s products, could affect its operating results.Estimate TrendInteger Holdings is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for the current quarter. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 3.5% south to $4.13 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $351.2 million, suggesting a 12.9% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our first-quarter revenue estimate of $358 million, suggesting a 15.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Yet, rising pressure to reduce reimbursement rates for generic drugs dents growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).CVS Health exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a strong note, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Robust sales growth across all three operating segments drove the top-line results. Within the Health Care Benefits arm, continued growth across the entire range of insured and self-insured medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health products and services instills optimism.Meanwhile, the company’s parallel announcement of entering into a colossal $10.6-billion acquisition agreement to purchase Oak Street Health is an added positive. Oak Street Health is a network of value-based primary care centers for adults on Medicare. The acquisition is expected to further advance CVS Health’s care delivery strategy for consumers.During the fourth quarter, CVS Health recorded a seven-million increase in unique digital customers to more than 47 million, reached eight million active users on CVS Health’s individualized Health Dashboard and interacted with nearly five million customers daily across the community footprint. The company also launched a new functionality that gives patients more choices and convenience for filling prescriptions.Following the acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna for a colossal sum of $70 billion, CVS Health introduced its Health Care Benefits business arm. This segment has been exhibiting continued strong momentum for the past few quarters. In the fourth quarter, the business delivered strong revenue growth of 11.3% year over year, banking on growth across all product lines.CVS Health Corporation PriceCVS Health Corporation PriceCVS Health Corporation price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteDuring the reported quarter, Medical membership increased by 109,000 members, reflecting increases across all product lines. During the fourth quarter, the segment witnessed the benefits of prior-periods’ healthcare cost estimates in its Government Services and Commercial businesses.Story continuesOn the flip side, during fourth-quarter 2022, gross margin contracted 135 basis points (bps) to 16.5% on an 11.2% uptick in total cost (including Benefit Costs). The contraction of margins on escalating costs does not bode well. The decline in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing sales is a downside. Further, persistent pharmacy reimbursement headwinds also continued to impact business performance in the quarter under review.Further, the reimbursement pressure in the Pharmacy Services segment is projected to be exacerbated by the cumulative effect on rebate guarantees of the lower brand name drug price inflation and a modest selling season. The company is making continued efforts to combat this reimbursement pressure by increasing volume and reducing costs.Mounting costs and expenses are putting pressure on margins as well. Total cost (including Benefit Costs) rose 11.2%. The gross margin contracted 135 basis points (bps) to 16.5%.The adjusted operating margin in the quarter under review contracted 24 bps to 4.4% despite a 3.9% rise in adjusted operating profit.Over the past year, CVS Health has outperformed its industry.

(HOLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-hologic-inc-130001398.html,1680699601,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this medical device maker have returned +2.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.5% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 0.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -57.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -37.9%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +6.7% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $967.05 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -32.6%. The $3.97 billion and $4.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.4% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980.98 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.89%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

105,4c43dc0b-9f26-367c-a698-f32640de761d,NFLX,2023-04-06,Wall Street analysts favor Disney over Netflix ahead of earnings,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/wall-street-analysts-favor-disney-141045002.html,1680703845,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'DIS']","[Yahoo Finance’s Allie Canal joins the Live show to break down why Wall Street analysts are favoring Disney over Netflix.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- The two biggest names in streaming are facing a number of headwinds. Disney just made it through a CEO shakeup and now is battling it out with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Meanwhile, Netflix is looking to rein in cost and lift revenue.So which name does Wall Street think will come out on top despite it all? Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has all the answers for us. Allie?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, it's always interesting to see Netflix and Disney paired against each other because they are very different companies. But at the same time, they're going through this media reckoning that we've seen across the landscape when it comes to high costs and profitability issues.Now, from an analyst rating perspective, they seem to be bullish on both stocks. Disney seems to be the winner, with about 80% of analysts who cover Disney giving that stock a buy rating. Netflix, on the other hand, about 50% of analysts give that stock a buy rating. And on top of that, Disney also wins out when it comes to potential upside, with analysts seeing a 26% upside for Disney with just about a 4% upside potential for Netflix. That's according to data from FactSet.But there are bull cases for both companies. If we take a look at the bull case for Netflix, that largely centers around its crackdown on password sharing, along with its recently launched ad-supported tier, which did debut in November. Those are two big revenue initiatives.And because of those efforts, we saw Bank of America earlier this week named Netflix as one of its top second quarter picks. Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall also said that he expects more outperformance in the stock over the efforts surrounding the password sharing crackdown. If we take a look at where shares are trading today, they're up about 18% on the year, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500. So that's Netflix.Story continuesAnd if you want to switch gears and take a look at the bull case for Disney, that all centers around its diversification. It's not a company that is completely reliant on streaming. We have other components of this business that can help offset some of those streaming risks.We have the parks business, for example. That is a business that has been very resilient, especially post COVID. We also have sports with ESPN. We have movies.So there's a lot of other things to work with here. And that's really attractive for both investors and analysts alike. So it seems like for analysts, they're leaning more towards Disney than Netflix. And with Bob Iger at the helm, that just instills greater confidence in this stock moving forward.- Do they believe in one's profitability model versus the other? Is it clear where they're honing in on margins, as many of the activist investment campaigns around Disney that have circled it like a shark before kind of stepping back after Bob Iger seemingly put some of those issues to rest at the last earnings call, is it seeming that the investment community is also picking up on that, too?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think they are picking up on that. Look, profitability for both of these companies is clearly paramount. And they both gone on significant cost-cutting initiatives.You take a look at a company like Disney, they're in the midst of layoffs, cutting 7,000 jobs. They've restructured the business. In a similar vein with Netflix, they are leaning into those revenue initiatives to try and boost the average revenue per user. It's not all about the subscriber anymore, which is historically what we've seen from Netflix in the past.Now, analysts have said, look, Netflix is clearly the leader here. Disney is, too. But, again, it's that diversification that makes profitability more in reach for a company like Disney because they have other things to work with if things go south in streaming, whereas Netflix, it's really a one-trick pony there. And that's why you've seen them trying to experiment with different things, like live events--- Video games.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --video games, workouts. My friend did a Netflix workout the other day.- Really?

Nears Deal for Harry Potter Online TV SeriesTop Tax Mistakes to Avoid If You Make More Than $100,000The Final Mission for a California Military Base: Become HousingWall Street Shuns Risk as Recession Talk Ramps Up: Markets WrapThe video-streaming giant is cracking down on the ability of its users to share subscriptions across locations, a move that analysts say could push millions of borrowers to spring for their own plans. This strategy, along with the debut of a lower-cost tier with advertising, could keep user growth robust, supporting an extended rebound in the stock.“There are millions of people on shared accounts, and if you get a few bucks per month out of even a small percentage of them, that creates a huge recurring revenue base that can supplement current growth,” said Jamie Lumley, senior analyst at Third Bridge, who sees the crackdown as a “huge opportunity” for the company.Netflix shares already have more than doubled off a 2022 low and are up 18% off a low hit last month. Despite these gains, the stock remains about 50% below a peak from late 2021. The stock fell 1% on Wednesday.Analysts have been warming to the stock. The average estimate for Netflix’s 2023 earnings per shares has risen by 8.4% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue is expected to increase 8.6% this fiscal year before accelerating to almost 12% growth in fiscal 2024. It rose 6.5% last year.Wells Fargo Securities sees the crackdown as a primary driver of this optimism, as the efforts “appear to be creating significant upside to estimates.” Despite the attention paid to the ad tier, analyst Steven Cahall wrote, “paid sharing is arguably the bigger near-term earnings opportunity.”Story continuesBank of America Corp. expects subscriber results for the US and Canada “will be significantly stronger than current consensus,” citing an analysis of third-party data that it sees as “an encouraging sign that NFLX’s recent crackdown on password sharing is driving new subs to the service.”Netflix has said that more than 100 million people are using the service without paying for it. The company reports first-quarter results April 18, and analysts expect it will add 2.3 million subscribers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That will bring total paid memberships to 233 million.One potential pitfall is that the company alienates subscribers with its tougher stance. And given the strength of the recent stock rally, any sign that subscriber growth is disappointing could lead to a big drop in the shares.“There’s some risk Netflix could be too restrictive, but we’re pretty optimistic that this won’t lead to a lot of people canceling,” said Third Bridge’s Lumley.The company is restructuring its film group to make fewer movies each year, and this focus on costs, along with any subscriber tailwind from the password crackdown, could reinforce the idea that the stock is attractive at current levels.In a measure of how Wall Street is viewing its prospects, Moody’s Investors Service last month upgraded Netflix’s senior unsecured notes to investment grade, up from junk status.Shares trade at about 26 times estimated earnings, about a third of the stock’s average valuation over the past 10 years, though still a modest premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index.To Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, that’s still attractive given Netflix’s growth potential.“Netflix is generating revenue growth, while the film restructuring shows it is doing a good job of protecting its bottom line,” he said. “Meanwhile, even if the password move adds just 10-12% growth to subscribers, that’s a measurable number. In an economy that is likely slowing, where else are you going to get that kind of growth?”Tech Chart of the DayThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has risen 24% this year, as of its last close, easily outperforming the 18% gain in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the software sector. Jordan Klein, a tech sector specialist at Mizuho Securities, wrote that software feels like the more “‘watched’ sector by investors,” and that “more money wants to come into Software vs Semis.” He added that investors are focused on a potential recovery for chipmakers in the second half of the year, which could help offset signs of weakness in the first half of 2023.Top Tech StoriesAmazon.com Inc. laid off about 100 employees in its video-game divisions as part of its broader cutbacks, affecting workers at Prime Gaming, Game Growth and the company’s San Diego studio.Amazon and Microsoft Corp.’s cloud services could face a full-blown antitrust probe in the UK after the country’s digital regulator said the firms may be abusing their market power to thwart fair competition.Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world’s largest maker of Apple Inc.’s devices, increased revenue by only 3.9% last quarter, underscoring how fears of a recession are crimping demand for iPhones and other consumer electronics.Twitter Inc. is struggling to sell users on its new subscription product, Twitter Blue, according to a new report.India is muscling in on the increasingly lucrative business of space, taking advantage of the geopolitical isolation of China and Russia to pitch itself as a reliable alternative to SpaceX.Apple is set to open its first official retail store in India soon, a landmark move for the iPhone maker, which is placing big bets on the South Asian nation for everything from manufacturing to sales.Japan’s decision to join the US and Netherlands in restricting exports of chipmaking gear to China is giving the allies powerful new weapons to deploy in the escalating technology war.--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.(Updates to market open.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsXi Jinping Launches a Charm Offensive to Repair China’s Tattered ImageThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsA Giant Rail Merger Escapes Washington’s Big Deal Crackdown©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The company expects declining oil and gas prices to lower earnings of its production business. The oil major expects its upstream business to lower earnings by $1-$1.8 billion in the first quarter, sequentially, as crude prices fell.The decline in natural gas prices is likely to have negatively impacted the upstream business’s profits by $400-$800 million, while lower crude oil prices accounted for $0.6-$1 billion. The company could face $1.8-$2.2 billion in upstream mark-to-market derivative losses.ExxonMobil stated that the rising refining margins could result in a $200-million sequential decline in earnings or remain flat sequentially. The value of unsettled derivatives is likely to have been positively impacted by $300-$700 million. Moreover, the margins in the company’s chemical units could result in $100 million of sequential improvement/decline in earnings in the first quarter.Improving fuel demand and strong commodity prices are likely to have aided the energy businesses in the first quarter. Per Zacks Earnings Trends, the energy sector is on track to generate $38.6 billion in earnings in the first quarter of this year, suggesting an improvement from $36.5 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter.Price PerformanceShares of ExxonMobil have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

Strong quarterly earnings were primarily driven by increased drilling activity by customers, offset partially by higher total expenses.At the fourth-quarter end, Cactus had cash and cash equivalents of $344.5 million, which can provide it with immense financial flexibility. Cactus had no bank debt outstanding as of Dec 31, 2022.Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s MPC adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54. The bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and another $700 million worth of shares from the start of this year till Jan 27. Marathon Petroleum, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $7.6 billion.Phillips 66 PSX reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $4 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.34. Lower-than-expected quarterly earnings were driven by lower contributions from the Chemicals segment. The negatives were partially offset by strong refining margins worldwide.Phillips 66 received approval from the board of directors to hike its dividend. The new quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share reflects an increase of 8.2% from the previous quarter’s 97 cents and a 14% hike from the year-ago quarter’s 92 cents.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Phillips 66 (PSX).Phillips 66 currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 42.9% and 14.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PSXBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PSXCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Phillips 66 here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Phillips 66, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in PSX?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Phillips 66, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $15.88.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Phillips 66. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Phillips 66 may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

109,a8856365-e8e1-33c9-85ce-602c4cc8dff1,PSX,2023-04-06,3 Dividend Stocks to Gain Despite Volatility in Energy Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-stocks-gain-despite-121012852.html,1680696612,STORY,"['MPC', 'VLO', 'PSX']","[Notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector, as reflected in the wild swings in oil prices since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby making Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC,Valero Energy Corporation VLO and Phillips 66 PSX well-poised to gain.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices have behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data is per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Although oil price is currently favorable, the commodity’s pricing environment will remain volatile.Dividend Stocks to the RescueOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter investors from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. Handsome margins and throughput in all regions are aiding MPC. It pays out a quarterly dividend of 75 cents ($3.00 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.38% yield at the current stock price. (Check Marathon Petroleum’s dividend history here).Valero Energy Corporation: Constraint in worldwide refining capacity amid demand recovery is aiding Valero Energy. This is likely to boost the utilization of refinery capacity and, in turn, drive its bottom line. Valero Energy pays a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of $1.02 ($4.08 annualized) per share. (Check Valero Energy’s dividend history here).Phillips 66: Phillips 66 is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistic player with a presence in Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties businesses.

In each of the operations, Phillips 66 has a good footprint pertaining to safety, profitability, size and competitive strengths.It is focusing more on businesses like midstream, renewables and chemicals, which makes the business model more stable. The firm’s premier midstream operations comprise the U.S. pipeline network, spread across 22,000 miles. The midstream portfolio includes multiple refined product terminals, crude oil terminals and NGL terminals. Thus, with a robust midstream business portfolio, Phillips 66 will generate stable cashflows with lower exposure to energy business volatility.The firm’s financial strength is reflected in its lower debt exposure compared with the composite stocks belonging to the industry. PSX, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), also has a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Further, it has more than $12 billion in liquidity.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space include Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, Sunoco LP SUN and Valero Energy Corporation VLO.

In the past 60 days, Sunoco has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2023.Valero Energy is well poised to gain from constraint capacity in global refining activities and favorable demand for refined products.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this gold and copper miner have returned +20.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, which Newmont falls in, has lost 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.29 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -58%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +21.1%. This estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.64 indicates a change of +17.7% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Newmont is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Newmont, the consensus sales estimate of $2.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.6%. The $11.9 billion and $12.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.2% and +1.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $3.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.6%. EPS of $0.44 for the same period compares with $0.78 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.57%. The EPS surprise was -6.38%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries say the explosions were deliberate, but have yet to determine who was responsible.The blast in the Swedish zone occurred at a depth of 80 meters, which the Swedish prosecutor said made it complicated to investigate.""We believe it will be rather difficult to determine who did this,"" prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist told Reuters in a phone interview.""The people who did this have probably been aware that they would leave clues behind and probably took care so that the evidence would not point in one direction, but in several directions,"" he added.""That makes it difficult to clearly point to one actor.""The investigation continues.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas in the political spotlight and the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines has hastened the bloc's switch to other energy suppliers.Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, each consisting of two pipes, were built by Russia's state-controlled Gazprom to pump 110 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas a year to Germany.Ljungqvist said investigators had been able to determine what type of explosive had been used and that it ruled out ""a very large number of actors"", but declined to name the explosive, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation.Story continuesWhile no conclusion has been drawn there have been a number of theories as to who blew up the pipelines and how.Germany has confirmed its investigators raided a ship in January that may have been used to transport the explosives used to blow up the pipelines. German media reported the boat could have been used by a small Ukrainian or pro-Ukrainian group.Ljungqvist said it could not be completely ruled out that an independent group, as opposed to a state actor, was behind the attack, but that it was unlikely.""There are certain companies that have certain special missions that mean they could, in theory, carry this out,"" he said. ""We don't rule out anything, but that it is a state actor who is directly or at least indirectly behind this is of course our absolute main scenario, given all the circumstances.""U.S. journalist Seymour Hersch reported earlier this year that American authorities, with aid of the Norwegian military, were behind the attack.Both the United States and Ukraine have denied having anything to do with the attacks as has Russia. Moscow, without providing evidence, has blamed the explosions on Western sabotage.Ljungqvist said the incident had become an open arena for attempts to influence the hotly debated proceedings, likely with the purpose of deliberately sowing confusion.""I don't want to comment on any specific report but I can conclude that many of the hot theories can be easily ruled out based on what we know from the investigation,"" he said.(Reporting by Johan Ahlander, additional reporting by Simon Johnson and Essi Lehto; editing by Niklas Pollard and Susan Fenton)]"

General Dynamics (GD), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This defense contractor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2.29%.For the most recent quarter, General Dynamics was expected to post earnings of $3.53 per share, but it reported $3.58 per share instead, representing a surprise of 1.42%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3.16 per share, while it actually produced $3.26 per share, a surprise of 3.16%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for General Dynamics lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.54% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. General Dynamics (GD) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.64 a share 21 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 26, 2023.GD has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.54%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.64 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62.GD is just one of a large group of Aerospace stocks with a positive ESP figure. Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Virgin Galactic is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 4, 2023. SPCE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.47 a share 29 days from its next earnings release.For Virgin Galactic, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.50 is 6.75%.Story continuesGD and SPCE's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Per the terms of the deal, Northrop Grumman has the option to manufacture SEWIP Block 3 Hemisphere Systems.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Baltimore, MD.Importance of SEWIP Block 3The rising threat of missile attacks has been fueling the demand for an effective electronic attack system that excels in defeating inbound threats.In this context, it is imperative to mention that Northrop Grumman’s SEWIP enjoys significant demand for its features that protect surface ships from anti-ship missiles, providing early detection, signal analysis and threat warning. NOC’s SEWIP is an upgrade to the legacy AN/SLQ-32 system, and provides game-changing capability for non-kinetic electronic attack options to the U.S. fleet.Such advantages of the electronic warfare system make it an attractive option for the military, thereby resulting in NOC winning orders for the same, like the latest one. These developments are likely to boost the company’s revenue-generation prospects from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. As a result, an effective electronic warfare system with anti-missile solution features is likely to witness a pent-up demand.Per a report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2027. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop Grumman as its SEWIP Block 3 product already has an established position in the electronic warfare system market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should also benefit other defense majors who have forayed into the laser-based countermeasure system like Lockheed Martin LMT, L3Harris Technologies LHX and General Dynamics GD.Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (“AOEW”) program delivers persistent electronic surveillance and attack capability against naval threats like anti-ship missile (ASM). Its AOEW Active Mission Payload AN/ALQ-248 system is a self-contained electronic warfare pod hosted by the MH-60R or MH-60S Seahawk helicopter, which provides the Navy with advanced ASM detection and response capabilities.LMT’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.9%. Its shares have returned 9.3% value to investors in the past year.L3Harris’ Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare suite is custom designed to be a baseline on advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and maximize their survivability and mission success.

The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries say the explosions were deliberate, but have yet to determine who was responsible.The blast in the Swedish zone occurred at a depth of 80 meters, which the Swedish prosecutor said made it complicated to investigate.""We believe it will be rather difficult to determine who did this,"" prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist told Reuters in a phone interview.""The people who did this have probably been aware that they would leave clues behind and probably took care so that the evidence would not point in one direction, but in several directions,"" he added.""That makes it difficult to clearly point to one actor.""The investigation continues.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas in the political spotlight and the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines has hastened the bloc's switch to other energy suppliers.Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, each consisting of two pipes, were built by Russia's state-controlled Gazprom to pump 110 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas a year to Germany.Ljungqvist said investigators had been able to determine what type of explosive had been used and that it ruled out ""a very large number of actors"", but declined to name the explosive, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation.Story continuesWhile no conclusion has been drawn there have been a number of theories as to who blew up the pipelines and how.Germany has confirmed its investigators raided a ship in January that may have been used to transport the explosives used to blow up the pipelines. German media reported the boat could have been used by a small Ukrainian or pro-Ukrainian group.Ljungqvist said it could not be completely ruled out that an independent group, as opposed to a state actor, was behind the attack, but that it was unlikely.""There are certain companies that have certain special missions that mean they could, in theory, carry this out,"" he said. ""We don't rule out anything, but that it is a state actor who is directly or at least indirectly behind this is of course our absolute main scenario, given all the circumstances.""U.S. journalist Seymour Hersch reported earlier this year that American authorities, with aid of the Norwegian military, were behind the attack.Both the United States and Ukraine have denied having anything to do with the attacks as has Russia. Moscow, without providing evidence, has blamed the explosions on Western sabotage.Ljungqvist said the incident had become an open arena for attempts to influence the hotly debated proceedings, likely with the purpose of deliberately sowing confusion.""I don't want to comment on any specific report but I can conclude that many of the hot theories can be easily ruled out based on what we know from the investigation,"" he said.(Reporting by Johan Ahlander, additional reporting by Simon Johnson and Essi Lehto; editing by Niklas Pollard and Susan Fenton)]"

144,2a401b51-9583-31ad-8e3e-dcd0809a511f,EXPE,2023-04-06,3 Growth Stocks That Are Dominating the E-commerce Industry,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-stocks-dominating-e-233425519.html,1680478465,STORY,"['JD', 'BABA', 'EXPE']","[As per a report by The Business Research Company, the global e-commerce industry is expected to reach $4.90 trillion by the end of 2027. Accordingly, this translates into a compounded annual growth rate of 11.4%. This growth will be driven by the high adoption of smartphones and a surge in the number of internet users. This sector has been growing annually at a clip of around 15%. Additionally, the pandemic was partly responsible for this growth, as more shoppers looked for online options to continue spending their money. Due to the pandemic and lockdowns, consumers went online and the e-commerce sector boomed. This is a well-known phenomenon. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, moving forward, some of these trends are likely to remain. Thus, the “stickiness” of this trend is what I’m most interested in. And personally, I think e-commerce is the future, making some of these e-commerce growth stocks among the best ways long-term investors can opt into massive capital appreciation potential. Let’s dive in.JDJD.com$43.89BABAAlibaba$102.18EXPEExpedia$97.03JD.com (JD)the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a buildingSource: testing / Shutterstock.comIt is impossible to think of e-commerce growth stocks without thinking about China. One of the largest Chinese e-commerce players, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), is a great place to start our discussion.JD.com is unique from its peers, as the company targets China’s second-tier cities. Accordingly, the company has invested heavily in its logistics network, while cutting expenses. Notably, JD’s 2022 free cash flow came in at $5.2 billion, which is significantly up from its 2021 numbers. Currently, JD stock is trading around $44 today with massive growth potential. The stock is currently trading at a discount, due to several headwinds tied to the Chinese market.However, the China opening could benefit JD.com significantly. That’s because the company is vertically-integrated, with several segments such as JD Industrials, JD Health, JD Logistics, and JD Property. These divisions are supported by a large warehouse network that supports all its businesses. Recently, the company announced that it plans to spin off JD Property and JD Industrials through separate listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Story continues Investors should keep in mind that the total addressable market in China is in the trillions, and even if JD manages to get a hold of a small piece of this pie, the company’s growth potential is immense.Alibaba (BABA)The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the backgroundSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.comI’ve always loved Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) as an e-commerce business. While the company is past its best days, it still remains one of the top e-commerce giants, with a massive consumer base. The stock is up roughly 12% year-to-date, despite the market volatility, trading just shy of $103 today. Alibaba’s management team has an increasingly upbeat outlook. This is bolstered by the company’s impressive market positioning, which was reflected in impressive numbers this past quarter. Alibaba posted 15% growth in free cash flow, as well as 16% growth in EBITDA. As far as momentum is concerned, BABA stock is on a nice upward trend. Thus, for those of the view this market momentum can continue, BABA stock is one to watch over the near-term.Over the longer-term, I think Alibaba’s move to break up its conglomerate into six separate businesses that will have their own funding, leadership teams, and IPOs, is a good move. Additionally, the Chinese market reopening could benefit the company and we could see the stock inching closer to the 52-week high of $125. My InvestorPlace colleague David Moadel explains whether Alibaba can hit $200, since a lot of analysts are bullish on the stock. If China’s economy accelerates this year, we could see the stock pick up its pace. Expedia (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comTravel companies are set to benefit from revenge travel and the re-opening of the world. Indeed, one of the top online travel agencies, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), has seen this trend play out, posting very strong fourth-quarter results. Currently, EXPE stock is trading around $97 per share today, and is up 9% year-to-date. The company reported 15% growth in the top line and a 17% growth in net income. Additionally, Expedia hit an impressive milestone, with 70.8 million booked room nights. That’s a massive rise, considering the pandemic-driven slump which still pervaded last year’s numbers. This led to 36% growth in revenue in 2022, and I believe this momentum will continue throughout 2023. A lot of people have realized that they do not want to wait for cheaper airfares or for the right time to travel. The pandemic has changed the way we look at travel and spend money on this line item. Today, it has become more of a necessity than a luxury. Expedia ended the year with record profits, posting an improvement in its business in January as compared to the previous quarter. This means we should be prepared for even better numbers this year. At current levels, EXPE stock looks undervalued, with the potential to trade much higher. Analysts are bullish on the stock and believe that it will trade over $100 very soon. Regardless, this is one stock that is set to reward long-term investors, in my view. On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Vandita Jadeja is a CPA and a freelance financial copywriter who loves to read and write about stocks.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.25%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.24%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.88%.Coming into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 2.06% in the past month. In that same time, the Aerospace sector lost 1.59%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.48%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Lockheed Martin as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Lockheed Martin is projected to report earnings of $6.13 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 4.81%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.91 billion, down 0.33% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $26.84 per share and revenue of $65.8 billion. These totals would mark changes of -1.43% and -0.28%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Lockheed Martin is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Lockheed Martin is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.2. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.15.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that LMT has a PEG ratio of 2.65. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Aerospace - Defense was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.97 at yesterday's closing price.The Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 63, putting it in the top 25% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

(PHM) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-pultegroup-inc-phm-130001485.html,1680699601,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 5.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.52 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -30.4%. This estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.36 indicates a change of -2.2% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.27 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.09 billion and $14.06 billion estimates indicate -13.2% and -0.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $5.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $3.63 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.33%. The EPS surprise was +26.04%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session.

This amount was more than 4 times the previously announced $2.0 billion J&amp;J had previously committed alongside subsidiary LTL Management’s first bankruptcy filing in October 2021. J&amp;J established LTL Management to manage claims in the cosmetic talc litigation. However, J&amp;J still maintains its stance that its talc-based products are safe and the talc lawsuits lack merit.This world's biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.4%. Revenues are expected to be $23.56 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

160,6204ea00-aa2e-313d-be7d-b3e8e78fc40f,MOS,2023-04-06,The Mosaic Company (MOS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-company-mos-attracting-investor-130001847.html,1680699601,STORY,['MOS'],"[Mosaic (MOS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -14.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.5% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which Mosaic belongs, has lost 14.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Mosaic is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -43.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.4%. This estimate has changed -3.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.45 indicates a change of -27.8% from what Mosaic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Mosaic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MOS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Mosaic, the consensus sales estimate of $3.34 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -14.8%. The $15.13 billion and $12.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -20.9% and -15.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMosaic reported revenues of $4.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. EPS of $1.74 for the same period compares with $1.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.05%. The EPS surprise was -16.35%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Mosaic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Mosaic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We see very strong momentum,"" Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told reporters during his first visit to China since the COVID-19 crisis.Airbus says China’s traffic will grow by 5.3% annually over the next two decades, outstripping a global average of 3.6%.The France-based group has been assembling its best-selling A320-family planes in Tianjin outside the capital since 2008.The existing line puts together four jets a month from major parts shipped from Europe and complemented by a local supply chain, with plans to reach monthly capacity of six this year.The new plant will double that and bring to 10 the number of Airbus assembly lines operating or planned worldwide, including four in Germany, two in France and two in the United States.Apart from a foray into China by a predecessor company in the 1990s, Boeing has pursued a different industrial strategy, with assembly concentrated in two regions of the United States.Faury said the expansion would boost the European company's plans to lift output of the single-aisle A320neo to 75 a month in 2026, from 45 at end-2022, and leave some ""surge capacity"".The target has been delayed following havoc in global supply chains, but Airbus says it is pulling together a resilient system. Shares in the planemaker rose more than 1%.Story continuesORDER APPROVALSA separate framework or ""general terms agreement"" authorises the delivery to China of 160 aircraft already on Airbus' books, including 150 single-aisle jets and 10 A350s.Witnessed by reporters, Faury signed the agreements a day after Macron said Europe must resist reducing trade and diplomatic ties with China following tensions between China and the West.However, the lack of new business fell short of some expectations after an official in Macron's office earlier said the trip would not merely consist of repackaging announcements.Industry sources said Airbus was negotiating new orders on the sidelines of Macron's trip, but no immediate announcement was expected.In November, China approved existing deals for 140 Airbus jets during a visit by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.Diplomats say the bundling of big-ticket aircraft orders is carefully crafted at such summits, but industry officials said there was no double-counting between the two European visits.""Part of it is diplomacy; the more is announced for Europe, that is also a way of sending a message to the Americans,"" said a person with detailed knowledge of past China jet negotiations.In the past, China has tended to split jet purchases between Airbus and Boeing but deals with the U.S. planemaker have slowed significantly in recent years amid trade or political tensions.Plans for an assembly line in China are likely to capture attention in India, a growing economic and strategic rival whose aviation minister last month called on both Airbus and Boeing to set up local jetliner assembly following record plane orders.Asked about the company's footprint in India, Faury told Reuters in Beijing that Airbus was already deeply engaged in setting up assembly of the C295 military transporter in India.

Specifically, these objectives involve the optimization and automation of information within industrial spaces, including distribution centers, warehouses, and hospitals in support of Globe customers on their path to decarbonization.Ansys simulation enabled Globe’s XLP80 (pictured), a complete hybrid fuel cell system combined with lithium-ion battery power, to deliver high-energy output in support of a pro-hydrogen economyTemperature regulation is a key function of hydrogen-based fuel cell systems, as any missteps in system optimization can negatively impact energy conversion. Airflow is an important aspect of successful regulation that facilitates system cooling to manage any unexpected temperature fluctuations. For Globe, precision in these areas requires an understanding of mass flows, temperature drops, and flow distribution in one efficient loop involving a lot of time and physical testing.Globe is using Ansys simulation during computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to speed the validation of cooling loop performance and reduce the number of system iterations needed to verify temperature requirements. Simulating the cooling loop within the context of the entire fuel cell system also helps Globe engineers better understand the needed air flow, as well as identify any physical adaptations needed to optimize system performance. Using this approach, Globe reduced development costs by more than $150,000. Today, simulation is a key component of Globe's approval process for fast, predictively accurate results on the path to system certification — activity that will significantly accelerate system scaling possibilities in the future.Story continues""The transportation industry plays an outsized role in global decarbonization, where speed and reliability are critical,"" said Dr. Bernhard Wienk-Borgert, co-founder and chief technology officer at Globe Fuel Cell Systems. ""Globe's R&amp;D team relies on Ansys simulation combined with advice from CADFEM to accelerate the development of our novel solutions with the confidence that they will perform safely in the real world, while meeting customer objectives for carbon neutrality.""""Achieving carbon neutrality is a tremendous effort dependent upon novel solutions like hydrogen fuel cell technology to address our current climate crisis,"" said Prith Banerjee, chief technology officer at Ansys. ""Simulation presents immediate scaling opportunities for fuel cell technology that can drive down development times and fuel cell stack costs, and quickly open up numerous possibilities in markets that were once aspirational for our customers.""/ About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on its use by August.FDA approval could make Pfizer's shot the first maternal vaccine available to prevent the disease in infants.Sanofi and AstraZeneca are developing a single-dose antibody, nirsevimab, for RSV prevention in infants, which is also under FDA review.Pfizer's vaccine, RSVpreF, met one of the two main goals of the late-stage study. It was nearly 82% effective in preventing severe lower respiratory tract illness, such as very low oxygen levels or need for ventilator support, in infants in the first 90 days of life.Pfizer said severe illness occurred within three months in 6 infants whose mothers received the vaccine, compared with 33 infants from the placebo group who contracted serious RSV infections. The company evaluated 3,570 infants as part of the study.The shot was 69.4% effective in preventing severe infections in the first 180 days. Severe illness occurred within six months in 19 infants born to mothers in the vaccine group, compared with 62 infants in the placebo group.The shot failed to meet a second main goal of reducing non-severe illness in infants.About 58,000 to 80,000 children younger than 5 years old are hospitalized due to RSV infection every year in the United States, according to government data, and infants are among those at greatest risk for severe illness.

Discovery WBD, Fox Corp. FOXA and fuboTV FUBO.Industry: Broadcast MediaLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2074777/3-broadcast-radio-tv-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has been suffering from increased cord-cutting despite a spurt in demand for streaming content. However, industry participants like Warner Bros. Discovery, Fox Corp. and fuboTV are benefiting from a huge spike in digital content consumption. Diversified content offerings, which are original, regional, short and suitable for small screens (smartphones and tablets); improved Internet speed and penetration, and technological advancement are benefiting industry participants. As monetization and revenues, in terms of ad-spend, continue to be subdued, profit protection and cash management, with greater technology integration, have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving the top line in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry comprises companies offering entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction and musical content over television, radio and digital media platforms. These companies majorly derive revenues from the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions.Notably, these industry players are increasing their spending on research and development, as well as sales and marketing, in order to stay afloat in an era of technological advancements, with increased demand for VR and Internet Radio. The industry is likely to be focused on sustenance at current levels, along with a renewed emphasis on flexibility, which would accelerate the move to a variable cost model and reduce fixed costs.4 Broadcast Radio and Television Industry Trends to WatchShift in Consumer Preference a Key Catalyst: To adapt to the changes in the industry, companies are coming up with varied content for over-the-top (OTT) services in addition to linear TV. The availability of streaming services on a wide range of platforms is helping these services reach a global audience. It is also helping them expand their international user base, which, in turn, attracts advertisers to their platforms, boosting ad revenues.Story continuesThe use of services to help advertisers measure their ROI and enhance their use cases is expected to benefit advertisers and industry participants. Major leagues and events such as NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections attract significant ad revenues as well.Increased Digital Viewing Aids Content Demand: Many industry participants, who are either launching their OTT services or acquiring other OTT services, are banking on user insights to deliver the right content. Increased digital viewing is making consumer data easily available to companies, allowing them to apply AI and machine-learning techniques to create/procure targeted content. The move not only boosts user engagement but also allows industry participants to raise the prices of their services at an appropriate time without the fear of losing subscribers.Uncertain Macro-Economic Scenario Hurts Production and Ad Demand: Advertising is a major revenue source for Broadcast Radio and Television industry. Industry participants are bearing the brunt of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, raised capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and an anticipated recession, which encouraged advertisers to trim ad budgets and are expected to impact their top-line growth in the near term. Moreover, the industry players are facing stiff competition from tech and social media companies for ad dollars. This has been a major impediment to industry participants’ growth.Low-Priced Skinny Bundles Affect Revenues: Increased cord-cutting has forced industry participants to offer “skinny bundles.” These services, which are available through the Internet, often contain fewer channels than a traditional subscription and, therefore, are cheaper. The move is in line with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration, and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing.The alternative services are expected to keep users glued to their platforms, increasing the need to produce additional content. However, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen top-line growth for the industry players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #197, which places it in the bottom 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Apr 30, 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 33.3%.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching, as these have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But before we present such stocks, it is worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index over the past year.The industry has declined 19.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 8.9% and the broader sector’s slip of 14.8%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Broadcast Radio and Television stocks, the industry is currently trading at 9.16X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 12.58X and the sector’s 8.46X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 41.92X and as low as 8.27X, recording a median of 29.74X.3 Broadcast Radio and Television Stocks to BuyWarner Bros. Discovery: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s expanding direct-to-consumer offerings are driving top-line growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The increasing availability of its content across linear, digital over-the-top platforms like Hulu and Sling TV, is a major positive. Discovery+ is off to an impressive start. The availability of Discovery+ on LG Smart TVs in Canada is expected to aid the top line. A steady ad-spending environment, primarily in the international markets, and growing viewership despite incremental spending on marketing and content are expected to drive revenues in the near term.Markedly, the stock has jumped 59.8% year to date. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has moved up by a cent to $1.41 per share over the past 30 days.fuboTV: This Zacks Rank #2 company’s strengthening sports streaming offerings are expected to continue driving the top line in the near term. Last month, the company announced that it is rebranding its consumer-facing products as Fubo. Kicking off the rebrand is the launch of the company’s newest brand ad campaign. The nationwide campaign stars 15-time NBA All-Star, NBA Champion and Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett and veteran NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez, and is co-produced by Ryan Reynolds’ Maximum Effort Productions.Fubo Sports Network has added MLB.TV to its lineup of live baseball coverage besides current carriage of MLB Network, MLB Strike Zone, regional sports networks, local broadcast networks and national sports networks ESPN and FS1. This is expected to draw both audience and sponsors for the network. Fubo was the fastest-growing virtual multichannel video programming distributor in the fourth quarter 2022, achieving 251,000 net subscriber additions compared to a total of 371,000 additions among all reporting companies in the space.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 bottom line has narrowed from a loss of $1.69 per share to a loss of $1.46 per share over the past 30 days. FUBO’s shares have lost 35% year to date.Fox: The company is riding on the growing demand for live programming. The robust adoption of Fox News and Fox Business Network is expected to drive the user base in the near term. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generates a major portion of advertising revenues from live programming, which is relatively immune to the rapidly intensifying competition from subscription-based video-on-demand services.Moreover, recovering ad spending in the local advertising market is a major positive for Fox. Also, increasing affiliate-fee revenues are expected to drive Fox’s top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fox’s fiscal 2023 earnings has declined 0.9% to $3.46 per share over the past 30 days. The stock is up 1% year to date.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

192,5a40b5b2-779b-30d2-b96d-7b3de2e689db,FOXA,2023-04-06,Jury in defamation suit against Fox won't hear about Jan. 6,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jury-defamation-suit-against-fox-212644091.html,1680730004,STORY,['FOXA'],"[DOVER, Del. (AP) — The upcoming trial in a voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit against Fox News for airing false allegations of vote fraud in the 2020 presidential election will not include testimony about the Jan. 6 uprising at the U.S. Capitol, a judge ruled Wednesday.Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems claims that Fox program hosts, with the knowledge of executives for both Fox News and parent company Fox Corp., repeatedly allowed allies of former President Donald Trump to falsely claim that the machines and the software the company used were responsible for Trump’s election loss. Documents released during the lawsuit have shown that top Fox executives and personalities didn’t believe the claims but aired them anyway.“I don’t see Jan. 6 as relevant in this case,” Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said during a hearing Wednesday. “I know that probably shocks everyone.”The trial is set to begin April 17. Davis ruled last week that the statements that were aired were false, but he said a jury must decide whether Fox News acted with actual malice, whether Fox Corp. participated in the publication of the statements, and whether Dominion is entitled to any damages. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion.Dominion has specifically alleged that it was defamed by comments made on 17 programs that aired between Nov. 8, 2020, and Jan. 26, 2021, and in three tweets from former Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs.Davis noted that only one of the challenged programs aired after Jan. 6, and that it contained no mention of the uprising. That show was a Jan. 26 Tucker Carlson program in which My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell complained that he was the victim of “cancel culture” and asserted that he had found evidence of “machine fraud.”“What parties were thinking in January is not very relevant, if at all, to what happened in November and December,” the judge said, adding that allowing any testimony about Jan. 6 could result in unfair prejudice to Fox.Story continues“Fox is not the cause of Jan. 6 in its relation to Dominion,” Davis added. “I do think that’s a really big issue that has to be stayed away from.”Dominion alleged in its complaint that some Fox viewers believed the lies about the company ""with such devotion that they took the fight from social media to the United States Capitol and at rallies across the country to #StopTheSteal, inflicting violence, terror, and death along the way.""In another ruling, Davis denied requests from Dominion attorneys to compel certain executives for Fox News and Fox Corp., including several producers, to testify in person at the trial.Under Delaware law, Davis can compel officers, directors and managing agents of a Delaware corporation to appear in court to testify. He has already indicated that he can compel court appearances by Fox Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, director Paul Ryan, and Viet Dinh, chief legal and policy officer. Fox attorneys have nevertheless argued that 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch should not be forced to testify in person after having been deposed for seven hours.Meanwhile, Dominion asked Davis to compel live testimony of six other Fox officials, arguing that their high-level positions and discretionary acts made them “managing agents” for the defendants. The judge said he could compel the appearance only of Tom Lowell, senior executive vice president and managing editor for both Fox News and Fox Business. In doing so, he noted that Lowell had previously been chosen by Fox News to be deposed as a representative of the company.Dominion was unsuccessful in seeking to compel live testimony from Fox officials including Jerry Andrews, executive producer of the Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro show, and Gary Schreier, senior vice president of programming for Fox Business. They also sought to force live testimony from Irena Briganti senior vice president of corporate communications for Fox News Media; Ron Mitchell, vice president of primetime programming and analytics, and Raj Shah, a senior vice president at Fox Corp. who is responsible for “brand protection.”Davis refused to force those officials to travel to Delaware, but noted that Dominion could still seek to introduce their testimony through depositions, or even remotely through Zoom.The judge ended the hearing by encouraging attorneys to make final decisions on whom they plan to call as live witnesses, so that court personnel can begin making any necessary security preparations.]"

195,6636efad-c8c1-325c-8622-951d75e1fdd3,FOXA,2023-04-06,3 Broadcast Radio & TV Stocks to Watch in a Challenging Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-broadcast-radio-tv-stocks-133101225.html,1680701461,STORY,"['FOXA', 'FUBO', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has been suffering from increased cord-cutting despite a spurt in demand for streaming content. However, industry participants like Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, Fox Corporation FOXA and fuboTV FUBO are benefiting from a huge spike in digital content consumption. Diversified content offerings, which are original, regional, short and suitable for small screens (smartphones and tablets); improved Internet speed and penetration, and technological advancement are benefiting industry participants. As monetization and revenues, in terms of ad-spend, continue to be subdued, profit protection and cash management, with greater technology integration, have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving the top line in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry comprises companies offering entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction and musical content over television, radio and digital media platforms. These companies majorly derive revenues from the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions. Notably, these industry players are increasing their spending on research and development, as well as sales and marketing, in order to stay afloat in an era of technological advancements, with increased demand for VR and Internet Radio. The industry is likely to be focused on sustenance at current levels, along with a renewed emphasis on flexibility, which would accelerate the move to a variable cost model and reduce fixed costs.4 Broadcast Radio and Television Industry Trends to WatchShift in Consumer Preference a Key Catalyst: To adapt to the changes in the industry, companies are coming up with varied content for over-the-top (OTT) services in addition to linear TV. The availability of streaming services on a wide range of platforms is helping these services reach a global audience. It is also helping them expand their international user base, which, in turn, attracts advertisers to their platforms, boosting ad revenues. The use of services to help advertisers measure their ROI and enhance their use cases is expected to benefit advertisers and industry participants. Major leagues and events such as NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections attract significant ad revenues as well.Story continuesIncreased Digital Viewing Aids Content Demand: Many industry participants, who are either launching their OTT services or acquiring other OTT services, are banking on user insights to deliver the right content. Increased digital viewing is making consumer data easily available to companies, allowing them to apply AI and machine-learning techniques to create/procure targeted content. The move not only boosts user engagement but also allows industry participants to raise the prices of their services at an appropriate time without the fear of losing subscribers.Uncertain Macro-Economic Scenario Hurts Production and Ad Demand: Advertising is a major revenue source for Broadcast Radio and Television industry. Industry participants are bearing the brunt of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, raised capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and an anticipated recession, which encouraged advertisers to trim ad budgets and are expected to impact their top-line growth in the near term. Moreover, the industry players are facing stiff competition from tech and social media companies for ad dollars. This has been a major impediment to industry participants’ growth.Low-Priced Skinny Bundles Affect Revenues: Increased cord-cutting has forced industry participants to offer “skinny bundles.” These services, which are available through the Internet, often contain fewer channels than a traditional subscription and, therefore, are cheaper. The move is in line with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration, and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing. The alternative services are expected to keep users glued to their platforms, increasing the need to produce additional content. However, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen top-line growth for the industry players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #197, which places it in the bottom 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Apr 30, 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 33.3%.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching, as these have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But before we present such stocks, it is worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index over the past year.The industry has declined 19.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 8.9% and the broader sector’s slip of 14.8%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Broadcast Radio and Television stocks, the industry is currently trading at 9.16X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 12.58X and the sector’s 8.46X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 41.92X and as low as 8.27X, recording a median of 29.74X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (TTM)3 Broadcast Radio and Television Stocks to BuyWarner Bros. Discovery: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s expanding direct-to-consumer offerings are driving top-line growth.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The increasing availability of its content across linear, digital over-the-top platforms like Hulu and Sling TV, is a major positive. Discovery+ is off to an impressive start. The availability of Discovery+ on LG Smart TVs in Canada is expected to aid the top line. A steady ad-spending environment, primarily in the international markets, and growing viewership despite incremental spending on marketing and content are expected to drive revenues in the near term.Markedly, the stock has jumped 59.8% year to date. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has moved up by a cent to $1.41 per share over the past 30 days.Price and Consensus: WBDfuboTV: This Zacks Rank #2 company’s strengthening sports streaming offerings are expected to continue driving the top line in the near term. Last month, the company announced that it is rebranding its consumer-facing products as Fubo. Kicking off the rebrand is the launch of the company’s newest brand ad campaign. The nationwide campaign stars 15-time NBA All-Star, NBA Champion and Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett and veteran NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez, and is co-produced by Ryan Reynolds’ Maximum Effort Productions.Fubo Sports Network has added MLB.TV to its lineup of live baseball coverage besides current carriage of MLB Network, MLB Strike Zone, regional sports networks, local broadcast networks and national sports networks ESPN and FS1. This is expected to draw both audience and sponsors for the network. Fubo was the fastest-growing virtual multichannel video programming distributor in the fourth quarter 2022, achieving 251,000 net subscriber additions compared to a total of 371,000 additions among all reporting companies in the space.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 bottom line has narrowed from a loss of $1.69 per share to a loss of $1.46 per share over the past 30 days. FUBO’s shares have lost 35% year to date.Price and Consensus: FUBOFox: The company is riding on the growing demand for live programming. The robust adoption of Fox News and Fox Business Network is expected to drive the user base in the near term. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generates a major portion of advertising revenues from live programming, which is relatively immune to the rapidly intensifying competition from subscription-based video-on-demand services.Moreover, recovering ad spending in the local advertising market is a major positive for Fox. Also, increasing affiliate-fee revenues are expected to drive Fox’s top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fox’s fiscal 2023 earnings has declined 0.9% to $3.46 per share over the past 30 days. The stock is up 1% year to date.Price and Consensus: FOXAWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The company expects declining oil and gas prices to lower earnings of its production business. The oil major expects its upstream business to lower earnings by $1-$1.8 billion in the first quarter, sequentially, as crude prices fell.The decline in natural gas prices is likely to have negatively impacted the upstream business’s profits by $400-$800 million, while lower crude oil prices accounted for $0.6-$1 billion. The company could face $1.8-$2.2 billion in upstream mark-to-market derivative losses.ExxonMobil stated that the rising refining margins could result in a $200-million sequential decline in earnings or remain flat sequentially. The value of unsettled derivatives is likely to have been positively impacted by $300-$700 million. Moreover, the margins in the company’s chemical units could result in $100 million of sequential improvement/decline in earnings in the first quarter.Improving fuel demand and strong commodity prices are likely to have aided the energy businesses in the first quarter. Per Zacks Earnings Trends, the energy sector is on track to generate $38.6 billion in earnings in the first quarter of this year, suggesting an improvement from $36.5 billion recorded in the prior-year quarter.Price PerformanceShares of ExxonMobil have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

Strong quarterly earnings were primarily driven by increased drilling activity by customers, offset partially by higher total expenses.At the fourth-quarter end, Cactus had cash and cash equivalents of $344.5 million, which can provide it with immense financial flexibility. Cactus had no bank debt outstanding as of Dec 31, 2022.Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s MPC adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54. The bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and another $700 million worth of shares from the start of this year till Jan 27.

199,a8856365-e8e1-33c9-85ce-602c4cc8dff1,MPC,2023-04-06,3 Dividend Stocks to Gain Despite Volatility in Energy Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-stocks-gain-despite-121012852.html,1680696612,STORY,"['MPC', 'VLO', 'PSX']","[Notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector, as reflected in the wild swings in oil prices since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby making Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC,Valero Energy Corporation VLO and Phillips 66 PSX well-poised to gain.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices have behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data is per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Although oil price is currently favorable, the commodity’s pricing environment will remain volatile.Dividend Stocks to the RescueOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter investors from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation.

In each of the operations, Phillips 66 has a good footprint pertaining to safety, profitability, size and competitive strengths.It is focusing more on businesses like midstream, renewables and chemicals, which makes the business model more stable. The firm’s premier midstream operations comprise the U.S. pipeline network, spread across 22,000 miles. The midstream portfolio includes multiple refined product terminals, crude oil terminals and NGL terminals. Thus, with a robust midstream business portfolio, Phillips 66 will generate stable cashflows with lower exposure to energy business volatility.The firm’s financial strength is reflected in its lower debt exposure compared with the composite stocks belonging to the industry.

Although Tesla does not report sales by region, Motor Intelligence estimates that it sold 161,630 EVs in the U.S. during the first quarter.Ford’s DropFrom second place, Ford has dropped to fifth place, and it is now behind U.S. Hyundai Motor and Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY). However, Ford is ramping up production as it expects to expand annual production of F-150 Lightning at a Michigan plant to 150,000 this year.OutlookOn Monday, GM confirmed it plans to build 50,000 electric vehicles during the first half of the year and twice as many during the remainder of the year. Ford is aiming for a global annual production capacity of 2 million by 2026 while GM promised to hit that target in 2025.The Craze For Electric PickupsThe game changer this year will be the eagerly anticipated all-electric pickup trucks. Also on Monday, Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) confirmed it’s still on track to produce 50,000 EVs this year, as it is currently building the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, along with electric delivery vans for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). Tesla promised to start the production of its futuristic Cybertruck by the end of the year, but it has rescheduled production many times already so that promise remains questionable. Unfortunately, production of many eagerly anticipated models such as Atlis XT pickup remain unknown, although their specs promise to be nothing short of impressive. Atlis has an agreement with a solar-tonneau cover manufacturer Worksport Ltd (OTC: WKSP) to use its breakthrough technology. Worksport also has a supply partnership with Hercules Electric Mobility who is also due to release its luxurious electric pickup, Hercules Alfa. Even Hyundai has turned to Worksport to gain access to its solar-powered tonneau covers. Worksport is a player who promises to disrupt the pickup landscape and electric future as a whole with its proprietary technology as it is not only building the Solis solar-powered tonneau covers, but also developing the COR portable energy storage system which provides the possibility to power remote locations.Story continuesAll in all, 2023 promises to be an exciting year on the EV front with many new developments and power shifts between contenders.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

What, you thought I was going to say amazing pics of EVs for Instagram?To that end, yours truly and our senior auto correspondent Pras Subramanian had the opportunity to eat lunch (steak, if you must know) with GM CFO Paul Jacobson (he had the cobb salad) fresh off his widely followed Bank of America presentation in the morning.It’s there Jacobson further detailed news earlier in the day of 5,000 white-collar workers taking buyouts — a move that will save GM about $1 billion in costs.All of this is in line to what Jacobson told me several weeks ago on a fresh round of cost-cuts at the auto giant.General Motors Chairman &amp; CEO Mary Barra updates auto workers and the media on autonomous vehicles development and the Chevrolet Bolt EV at GM's Orion Assembly plant in Orion, Michigan, U.S., June13, 2017. REUTERS/Rebecca CookI found Jacobson, as usual, to be highly knowledgeable about his business, perhaps one of the most knowledgeable CFOs I have gotten to know in the past year. To that end, I put this thread to Jacobson and was a little surprised by the response.“We are a show me story,” Jacobson said, when asked why GM’s stock trades on a mere forward price-to-earnings multiple of 5.4 times despite a stretch of impressive quarters and bullish forward demand comments (which Jacobson reiterated at the lunch). I then followed up on if an “unlock” of the multiple would be possible if GM broke out the financials of its budding EV unit.He then explained that unlike rival Ford, GM will not be splitting its EV business from its internal combustion engine business. Some top investors want to see it, Jacobson told me, others not so.Jacobson believes it’s more important for GM to drive overall efficiencies from the business rather than go through an accounting exercise.Fascinating philosophical difference between two auto legends trying to track down the rich profit margins over at Tesla. Only time will tell which stock gets rewarded first in their EV efforts.Story continuesFinal fun fact: Jacobson is the new owner of a Camaro ZL1 and an electric Hummer (reviewed by Pras here), which he told us proudly he paid full stick price for.

GM Defense won the initial $214.3 million contract to develop the light and agile all-terrain troop carrier to transport a nine-Soldier infantry squad and their equipment in June 2020.GM Defense celebrates the full rate production decision for the Infantry Squad Vehicle, an expeditionary solution fielded to the U.S. Army’s 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.""I'm proud of the GM Defense team for reaching this important milestone in the Infantry Squad Vehicle program and am thankful for the close relationship we maintain with our trusted U.S. Army program office customer,"" said Steve duMont, GM Defense president. ""Achieving the ISV full-rate production decision strengthens our credibility and amplifies the success of our manufacturing processes. By working in close collaboration with our customer, we have delivered more than 300 vehicles to our U.S. Army customer with many already fielded to the Army's 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.""The ISV is based on the award-winning Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize truck architecture and leverages 90 percent commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts, including Chevrolet Performance race components. At 5,000 pounds, the expeditionary ISV is light enough to be sling loaded from a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter and compact enough to fit inside a CH-47 Chinook helicopter for air transportability. The vehicle's high percentage of COTS parts provide global defense and government customers flexibility and optionality to outmaneuver threats and support mission requirements as they evolve.""Our flexibility during the pursuit of the ISV helped us win the early stages of the contract award and has since played a pivotal role in delivering the best value solution to the U.S. Army,"" said Rick Kewley, GM Defense vice president of Product Development and Advanced Engineering. ""Not only did customer feedback make the ISV better at an accelerated pace, but it also helped us bring to bear the engineering and manufacturing expertise from our parent company, General Motors, to add new capabilities while fulfilling the Army's design and performance requirements. We remain confident in our ability to meet higher production quantities in the future.""Story continuesGM Defense has demonstrated the adaptability of the ISV by expanding the initial nine- passenger troop carrier into a family of vehicles. The GM Defense-produced ISV variants offer configurable vehicles adapted for a broad range of mission profiles, including fire support, command and control, electronic warfare, counter-unmanned aircraft systems, reconnaissance and logistics, and casualty evacuation.The ISV was the first major award for GM Defense since the subsidiary was reestablished by its parent company in 2017.

The team also discusses GM's announcement that 5,000 workers accepted a buyout amid cost cutting.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Shifting gears into the New York City Auto Week as some of the top executives in the industry are right in their own backyard. Brian Sozzi and Pras Subramanian got a chance to sit down with GM CFO Paul Jacobson fresh off of his announcement that General Motors would be saving about $1 billion in costs thanks, in part, to 5,000 workers accepting buyouts. You can read all about this in today's Morning Brief written up by, hey, that man right there, Brian Sozzi. Up now on the Yahoo Finance homepage.But for more, let's bring in Brian Sozzi himself. There goes that man again.BRIAN SOZZI: A tough gig eating some steak and talking about cars during Auto Week. But yeah, we got a chance, myself and Pras, our senior auto correspondent, talked to GM CFO Paul Jacobson. It was a brief or a small media roundtable. Really peppered him with a lot of questions.A couple of things that stood out to me in this lunch here, guys. Jacobson saying that or acknowledging that GM is, in fact, a show-me story. And that comes after me asking him, Paul, why is your stock essentially only trading at about a 5 and 1/2 times earnings? You can go to Yahoo Finance. Go to the GM ticker page. Go on the stats page, and you can see that multiple. Really trading well below-- well below the broader market.And he says you just have to focus more on driving efficiencies. And to that end, you saw that news yesterday that 5,000 workers are, in fact, taking buyouts. About a billion dollars in costs are going to come likely out of this business.And then I followed this up because we have been really tracking the progress at Ford fresh off its investor day about two weeks ago. They're breaking up or breaking out how their businesses are presented to investors, an EV business and then that internal combustion and engine business to better, I think, show investors the profit potential from EVs and the core gas-powered business.Story continuesPaul is telling us he's not going to do that. You know, they are focused much more, I think, on cutting costs on the overall business. You're really now seeing a philosophical difference emerge, at least in terms of how earnings and financials are presented, between a GM and Ford, and investors are going to have to decide which company and which presentation do they like more.JARED BLIKRE: Let me ask you here, what's the difference between those mindsets between GM and Ford and how you see them playing out in the future? For instance, Ford kind of acknowledging that maybe there are inherent differences in between the ICE motor, between the EV motor, and maybe there aren't that many synergies. Maybe this is a value unlock for the future, another IPO. Whereas GM is saying, no, we're going to do this under the same umbrella. Do you think it extends that far, if it's that encompassing?BRIAN SOZZI: One thing I'm appreciating more as I talked to these auto executives, how complicated this transition is to electric vehicles. And I do think Ford has done a good thing here splitting up its businesses.Let's keep in mind, these are different components for these vehicles. This is even a different workflow for the workers. And then you have to think about, well, how do you allocate their time? Should they have more time spent on developing electric vehicles or more time spent coming up with the next great gas-powered vehicle?I think Ford is on to something here. But again, that's not to say that GM can't come out here over the next couple of years and produce good margins.I will add this, though. Paul mentioning Tesla in our conversation. Ford has mentioned that as well. Both of these companies are really locked in on trying to produce the same operating margins as of Tesla. They are just really focused on it. Unclear if they can get there because, of course, they're legacy automakers still dealing with really high payrolls of union workforce. Tesla doesn't have that.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, the margins at Tesla still really trouncing the competition there. Thank you for that, Brian Sozzi.]"
211,ef4d5645-d634-3c10-890f-ba3eda58afcf,GM,2023-04-06,4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Garner Superior Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-price-cash-flow-125112278.html,1680699072,STORY,"['ABG', 'UNM', 'GM', 'PVH']","[We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. PVH Corp. PVH, Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM and Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. ABG boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:PVH Corp., which operates as an apparel company, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 16.1% for three-five years.

212,fb272aa4-205d-3dc9-a44e-506251ecbd45,MKC,2023-04-06,McCormick (MKC) Looks Tempting: Stock Up 15% Since Q1 Results,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-mkc-looks-tempting-stock-112611442.html,1680693971,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V', 'BYND', 'GIS']","[McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC appears an appetizing treat, with its shares up 17.6% in the past six months, outpacing the industry’s growth of 12.8%. Shares of this manufacturer, marketer and distributor of spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavors have increased almost 15% since the company released robust first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Mar 28.McCormick has been benefiting from its Global Operating Effectiveness (“GOE”) and the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) programs amid cost and supply-chain hurdles. While management expects mid-teens cost inflation in 2023, it expects to fully counter inflation through its pricing and other actions.Let’s delve deeper into first-quarter results and guidance alongside noting the key drivers of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated QuoteImpressive Q1 &amp; FY23 ViewFirst-quarter fiscal 2023 results reflected solid demand and early results from MKC’s moves to improve profit realization. First-quarter sales of $1,565.5 million moved up 3% year over year. Constant-currency (cc) sales increased 5% on 11% growth from pricing actions.Sales reflected the strength of McCormick’s vast global portfolio and the effective execution of its strategies. The company benefited from the solid underlying business performance, which was somewhat offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic and the exit of the Consumer business in Russia.The company’s GOE Program is yielding favorable results, with first-quarter savings in tandem with management’s expectations. The global demand for flavor continues to serve as the basis of the company’s sales growth. Management remains focused on capitalizing on long-term consumer trends, higher digital usage, trusted brands, healthy and flavorful cooking and purpose-inclined practices.McCormick anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance backed by sales growth. It expects the GOE Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have positively impacted the fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, are likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.The adjusted operating income is likely to increase 9-11%. Management expects adjusted earnings in the band of $2.56-$2.61 per share in fiscal 2023, suggesting 1-3% growth. The bottom line is likely to be fueled by a solid operating performance, partly offset by increased interest expenses and a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. The company envisions its 2023 adjusted gross margin to expand between 25 to 75 basis points year over year. The adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a positive impact of pricing and cost savings from the CCI-led and GOE programs.Story continuesCCI &amp; GOE Programs – Key DriversMcCormick’s CCI program has been helping the company reduce costs and enhance productivity. Although the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted gross profit margin contracted year over year, cost savings from the CCI and GOE programs and favorable pricing offered some respite. Such cost savings, coupled with effective pricing actions, are likely to continue enhancing the company’s profits in the future.In addition, the company is on track with normalizing its supply-chain costs and increasing efficiencies while strengthening the ability to service customers. Management is also undertaking streamlining actions in its entire organization.McCormick expects its GOE program to scale up as fiscal 2023 progresses. The company is on track to generate cost savings of $75 million in 2023 through its actions to normalize supply-chain costs and streamline its organization. These upsides are likely to help McCormick keep its growth story going.Other Solid Consumer Staple PicksSome other top-ranked consumer staple stocks are Post Holdings POST, General Mills GIS and Beyond Meat BYND.Post Holdings, which operates as a consumer-packaged goods company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). POST has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 34.8%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Post Holdings’ current fiscal-year EPS suggests an increase of 111.3% from the year-ago reported number.General Mills, a branded consumer foods company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

These stocks have effectively captured the attention of forward-thinking investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.The robotics sphere has been expanding at a rapid pace, with advancements in computing power and data handling capabilities facilitating mechatronic devices to perform tasks that were once deemed impossible. Moreover, industries such as healthcare, logistics, and automotive are experiencing significant disruption, making robotics stocks remarkably lucrative over the long term.According to a report last year, the global robotics market is projected to grow at a staggering annualized rate of 22.8% over the next decade, reaching a whopping $214 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by robust demand for industrial robots and technological enhancements. Artificial intelligence has vastly improved human-robot interactions, with cutting-edge chips enabling seamless collaboration. The surge in heavy-duty robotics applications continues to fuel demand for these innovative machines. That said, let’s delve into the top seven needle-moving robotics stocks that present promising long-term growth opportunities at current prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPATHUiPath$17.56IRTCIrthythm$124.03NVDANvidia$277.77IRBTiRobot$43.64ISRGIntuitive Surgical$255.47ABBABB.$34.30TERTeradyneBest Robotics Stocks: UiPath (PATH)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a robotic process automation (RPA) specialist, developing and supporting software bots that can effectively handle virtual tasks. These bots assist human workers in streamlining workloads and boosting productivity. Moreover, with its cutting-edge technologies, organizations can effectively automate tasks, freeing up resources and eventually leading to massive cost reductions.Story continuesUiPath has been growing sales rapidly, with triple-digit net retention rates. In the past eight consecutive quarters, the firm has surpassed expectations on both lines. Moreover, it continues to grow its annual recurring revenues (ARR) each quarter, recently recording a 30% bump in its most recent quarter. As it maintains stable revenue growth over the next few years, it can finally break even and reverse its stock’s negative trajectory.iRyhthm Technologies (IRTC)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockiRyhthm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) is a medical device company known for its popular Zio heart rate monitor. Its advanced heart monitoring systems streamline the process of data collection and monitoring allowing healthcare professionals to make more effective decisions.The firm’s single-use heart monitor helps detect abnormalities in heart rate patterns. iRhythm claims its devices can effectively increase early detection, which means patients will experience lower rates of heart failures, strokes, and hospitalizations. Its core market has a 20% penetration of roughly five million patients.The company has gained excellent traction with its target market, growing its revenue base by roughly 35% over the past five years. Additionally, it boasts a gross margin of 71.8% during the same period, significantly ahead of the sector median. As we advance, the firm expects 69% to 70% gross margins this year.Nvidia (NVDA)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) robust graphics processing units (GPU) have effectively revolutionized multiple industries, including robotics.

Its role in robotics is to provide the necessary computing power for AI and machine learning algorithms, enabling robots to perform complicated tasks. Through Jetson’s capabilities, robotics developers can build smarter and more autonomous machines that can effectively adapt to various environments.Furthermore, as the robotics industry moves from strength to strength, Nvidia’s Jetson platform and other initiatives could add another layer to its illustrious growth story.iRobot (IRBT)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) started as a military equipment producer, including robots for defusing bombs. Nowadays, it’s popular for its robotic cleaning devices, mainly the Roomba vacuum cleaners and Braava floor mops. It has sold millions of its home-cleaning devices, which experienced a particularly significant spike in interest during the pandemic. In recent quarters, though, growth rates have normalized, significantly weighing its stock price. However, Amazon’s acquisition bid for the company could be a major catalyst for its stock price moving forward.Amazon is looking to acquire the business for $61 a share, which is more than 40% higher than its current stock price. Also, if the deal falls through, iRobot could be picked up by another major company as the industry consolidates.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comCalifornia-based Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a leader in developing robotic surgical procedures, covering minimally invasive to major surgeries.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for CSX How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CSX is:33% = US$4.2b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.33.Does CSX Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, CSX has a superior ROE than the average (26%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining CSX's Debt And Its 33% Return On EquityCSX does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.44. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course CSX may not be the best stock to buy.

Agreement terms call for five days of paid sick leave annually plus an opportunity to convert two days from personal leave to sick leave.CSX’s president and chief executive officer, Joe Hinrichs, stated, “I want to thank the SMART-TD B&amp;O leadership for working with us to reach this important agreement for their members and adding to the progress we’re making together to improve the work experience for front-line employees who create value for our customers.”Apart from SMART-TD B&amp;O, unions that have negotiated paid sick leave for their members are the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way, which represents track workers, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, representing mechanical employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, representing railroad machinists, and the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers, an association of CSX’s utility workers.Such deals reflect CSX’s employee-friendly attitude through which it tries to maintain cordial relations with its employees and unions representing them, thereby providing a healthy work atmosphere at CSX.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCSX currently carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings CPA and GATX Corporation GATX.Copa Holdings currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Price and ConsensusAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. QuoteLSAG Segment in FocusThe introduction of Cary 3500 Flexible UV-Vis System bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Life Sciences &amp; Applied Markets Group (LSAG) segment, which contributes the most to the total revenues.In first-quarter fiscal 2023, the segment generated $1.03 billion revenues, accounting for 58.8% of the total revenues. Notably, the figure is up 6% on a reported basis and 11% on a core basis from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels.We believe the company’s strong focus on bolstering the LSAG segment is expected to contribute well to its overall performance, which in turn is likely to aid it in winning investors’ confidence going ahead.For fiscal 2023, Agilent expects revenues between $7.03 billion and $7.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $7.07 billion, indicating growth of 3.2% from 2022.Coming to the price performance, Agilent has gained 3.7% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.2%.Story continuesExpanding PortfolioApart from the latest move, the company announced the acquisition of e-Msion, which is known for an innovative electron capture dissociation technology called the ExD cell. As part of the deal, the ExD cell will be integrated into Agilent’s advanced workflows, instruments and analytical solutions, which in turn will drive Agilent’s momentum across laboratories as well as among biological researchers.Also, Agilent announced the acquisition of Avida Biomed, which develops high-performance target enrichment workflows to aid clinical researchers using next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches in studying cancer.The solutions of Avida Biomed highly complement Agilent’s SureSelect portfolio and NGS offerings. It added strength to A’s portfolio of clinical research solutions. The acquisition is expected to help Agilent strengthen its Diagnostics and Genomics Group segment.Further, the company released an on-deck thermal cycler, which enables more seamless workflows on Agilent’s Bravo NGS platforms.We believe that the growing portfolio offerings will continue to help Agilent strengthen its presence across various end markets.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Salesforce CRM and Analog Devices ADI.

(Photo: Business Wire)April is Financial Literacy Month, and Regions Next Step, the bank’s no-cost financial education program, is highlighting the importance of budgeting and saving to help people focus on key parts of money management. According to recent Regions Next Step surveys, Americans have serious questions and concerns about managing their financial futures. The good news is Regions Next Step has a wealth of information and budgeting tools to help people start or meet their financial goals.Surveys have found:Only 35% of respondents think they will save enough to retire comfortably.Roughly 60% of respondents say they do not follow a budget.Additionally, 76% of respondents are not confident they can withstand an unexpected financial emergency. For people with medical financial hardships, a survey in 2022 found people are not prepared to cover medical expenses or pay off debt.Regions Next Step has useful tools and information to help people start or meet financial goals. These resources are available to anyone, regardless of whether they have a Regions account, and there is no cost to access them.Story continues""Seasons of economic volatility create stress and make a real impact on finances,"" said Joye Hehn, Next Step financial education manager at Regions Bank. ""With inflation impacting every part of daily living, Regions Next Step is helping people lean into the basics of money management to keep their financial goals on track. Financial wellness is at the heart of how we serve consumers and businesses, and we invite people to not only check out our free tools online but also stop by for a personal conversation in any of our branch locations.""Resources available around the clock include:Budgeting and savings calculators help categorize spending, address debt and increase savings. People can use these and other online calculators to develop a budget, know where money is going every month, and work toward long-term savings goals.The Regions Next Step content library includes courses on creating a budget, building an emergency savings account, having family conversations about money and more. These self-paced, interactive courses are designed to help people grow money management skills. Each course takes 10 minutes or less to complete and can be accessed via a mobile device, tablet or desktop.Articles, podcasts, worksheets and other financial wellness resources are available in the Next Step Family Budgeting and Saving Resource Center to help set up families for financial success through all of life’s milestones.The Personal Spending Plan Worksheet can plan, track and organize monthly spending.Next Step workshops are available to people for one-on-one guidance to address their money-management needs.

This method accounts for every dollar of monthly income, so it can be helpful to use when people want to stretch their budget and find new ways to save. Each month, start from scratch and create a new budget that accounts for every dollar of income. Move any dollars saved by spending less than budgeted into a savings account.Track Spending: Closely track spending on a weekly or monthly basis to help ensure budget goals are on track. Regions has a free downloadable worksheet to track personal spending. At the end of the tracking timeframe, review spending trends, areas for improvement and areas on target.Set Savings Goals. Saving a little bit on a regular basis adds up over time. Set smaller savings targets along a timeline toward a goal. Consider saving a percentage of your tax refund as a simple way to begin.Do a Savings Challenge. Try Regions’ 52-Week Savings Challenge, and watch savings grow when a little money is put aside each week. By following the downloadable worksheet, $1,378 can be saved in 52 weeks. Just save the amount each week that corresponds with the week of the challenge.Maintain an Emergency Savings Fund. An emergency fund is key to managing unexpected expenses. Some examples include car or home repairs, medical bills or a sudden loss of income. Aim to set aside three to six months of income, and keep these funds separate from any other checking or savings account so you know it isn’t part of monthly operating expenses. This podcast is available for more tips on growing an emergency fund.Pay Down Debt. During periods of inflation, minimize existing debt with variable interest rates, such as credit card debt. Include these payments as a line item in the monthly budget. As you pay down debt, reallocate funds from paid debt to other debt or add it to savings.Financial wellness is a key part of Regions’ mission to make life better in the communities it serves. In 2022, Regions Next Step provided financial education to more than 2.1 million people across the Southeast, Midwest and Texas and received 3.2 million financial education content page views. Nearly 150,000 Regions podcasts and other resources on a variety of consumer and business topics were downloaded. Further, Regions Bank associates completed 9,800 financial education volunteer hours.""Regions Bank works with many community organizations to connect financial education opportunities to more people,"" said Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for Regions Bank.

By working together, we can keep our communities moving forward.""For more advice on budgeting, saving and planning, visit Regions.com/NextStep.

Thus, the innovation that financial technology, or fintech stocks, provide is going to be even more crucial for the future. For those bullish on the revolution in the financial sector, these companies provide much to be excited about.Many of these fintech stocks are among the most accessible, efficient, and cost-effective in the financial services industry. As a result, fintech stocks have become increasingly popular among investors seeking to capitalize on disruption.The companies below are leading the way in terms of disruption, focusing on research and development, product innovation, and rapid growth. In this article, I will explore some of the top fintech stocks riding the wave of disruption with excellent growth prospects.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVVisa$225.46PYPLPayPal Holdings$75.94SOFISoFi Technologies$6.07Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comLet’s kick off this list with one of the leading fintech stocks globally, shall we?Visa’s (NYSE:V) orientation towards innovation and research is one of the critical drivers of its financial performance and valuation growth. With its research arm, the company addresses complex challenges in the payment and fintech industry by using cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cryptography, and blockchain, to support its value.For example, Visa Research aims to achieve policy-enforced, entire lifecycle cryptographic protection for data across all computing environments. Additionally, Visa’s work on blockchain and digital currencies focuses on making digital currencies interoperable, while enhancing stand-alone processing.Additionally, Visa is expanding its reach in the creator economy by launching the Visa Ready Creator Commerce program. This program connects platforms to financial tools, such as instant payouts and tipping, addressing creators who are one of the fastest-growing categories of small businesses. To further support this community, the company partners with companies such as Linktree and Marqeta (NASDAQ:MQ).Story continuesNotably, Visa’s financial performance and critical business drivers for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 show the company’s potential to provide continued growth in the coming quarters. In addition, the company’s substantial payments volume and cross-border volume, driven by increasing demand for digital payments, are expected to remain steady.Additionally, the company’s focus on expanding its data processing capabilities will likely bolster revenues. While operating expenses are increasing, Visa’s efforts to streamline its operations and invest in growth opportunities are expected to support sustainable profitability.Overall, Visa’s commitment to research and development drives its upside potential. With its focus on cutting-edge technologies and partnerships, V stock is well-positioned for future growth in the fintech space.PayPal Holdings (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a dynamic fintech company constantly innovating to preserve its position as a leader. The company is improving its product portfolio by launching new products and services to strengthen its branded checkout experience and make it even easier to pay with Venmo.Passkeys have been enabled on iOS and Android devices, further simplifying checkout. PayPal has also introduced PayPal Savings and Rewards to enhance its digital wallet value proposition. In addition, it has revamped its PayPal Cashback Mastercard and launched Venmo Charity Profiles to add even more features.PayPal has expanded its merchant growth opportunities, launching Tap to Pay for small and midsize businesses in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. In addition, PayPal Working Capital has been introduced to France and the Netherlands, addressing the funding requirements of small businesses.PayPal has encountered some setbacks, with regulators increasing scrutiny of cryptocurrencies. A key partner in its stablecoin project now faces a probe by the New York State Department of Financial Services.However, despite a decline in non-GAAP earnings per share of 10% year over year, PayPal has rapidly allocated capital towards share repurchases in 2022, positively impacting its 3-year CAGR. Moving forward, PayPal has raised its guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share growth to 18%, focusing on cost savings and returning capital to shareholders.In summary, through its continued innovation and rapid product adoption, PayPal is harnessing growth opportunities in the financial technology sector.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)Mobile phone with website of US financial company Social Finance Inc (SoFi) on screen in front of logo Focus on top-left of phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) is certainly one of the key fintech stocks I’ve got on my radar. The company’s innovation is notable, with various initiatives and acquisitions over the past year that are turning heads.One of the key innovations I’ve got my eye on is the company’s move toward checking and savings accounts. SoFi’s diverse product portfolio now includes SoFi Checking &amp; Savings, which offers an industry-leading APY of up to 3.75%. The company also has a national bank license, allowing it to expand into conventional spaces with its value offerings, such as providing the best rates on loans. This should help the company maximize returns for its business, while allowing for reinvestment into product and service improvements.Notably, one of SOFI’s key strengths is its rapid growth. In 2022, the company added 480,000 new members in Q4, totaling 5.2 million, a 51% year-over-year growth rate. That’s some impressive growth investors ought to consider.Interestingly, to provide extra security for its members’ funds, SoFi has increased its FDIC insurance coverage to $2 million per account, higher than the industry standard of $250,000. This move will drive considerable value attraction towards its banking products over the long term, as the company becomes a haven for savers looking to stash cash away for a rainy day.Although the pace of growth of PayPal’s crucial growth drivers is slowing, the company is optimistic about its future. PayPal recently issued non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal year 2023. It expects to deliver $1.925–2.0 billion in revenue and $260–280 million in EBITDA at a 30% incremental margin.Overall, SoFi’s innovative and customer-centric product portfolio, impressive growth trajectory, and innovative initiatives make it a strong contender in the fintech market.As of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos was long SOFI.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Birmingham include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:84% of people in the Birmingham area are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service, experiencing the speed and security of 5G Ultra Wideband service. In the past several months, Verizon engineers expanded coverage and capacity with new cell sites covering Grayson Valley/Northeast Birmingham, north of Downtown Birmingham, Mulga in West Birmingham, around the Lakeshore Office, and the Hoover area. In the coming months, additional enhancements will be made to increase capacity in the Dolomite, Grayson Valley, South Adamsville and Overton East Birmingham areas to help manage the exponential increase in data usage Verizon is seeing from customers in those areas.Engineers have also improved in-building coverage in several stadiums, arenas and key buildings throughout Birmingham including Protective Stadium, the Westin, the Sheraton, the BJCC Concert Hall, Legacy Arena, Crossplex and Birmingham Airport. These in-building solutions use a combination of Verizon’s C-band spectrum for great coverage and Millimeter Wave (mmWave) spectrum, its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity.Birmingham’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Birmingham will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust servicesLastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Birmingham. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Birmingham area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Verizon is committed to delivering the most reliable network experience and meeting our customer’s connectivity needs, no matter where they are. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Birmingham with our secure, reliable, best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways.

No Thanks, Consumers Say",Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cheaper-mobile-plans-aim-dislodge-141119809.html,1680703879,STORY,"['T', 'VZ', 'TMUS']","[(Bloomberg) -- A handful of upstart wireless providers are offering monthly service plans at less than half the average cost of the major national networks, but complacent consumers seem to prefer to pay more rather than face the hassle of switching.Most Read from BloombergGoogle and Amazon Struggle to Lay Off Workers in EuropeChina Restraint on Taiwan Shows Xi Has Bigger Concerns NowNassim Taleb On What Bitcoiners, Anti-Vaxxers, VCs and Deadlifters Are Getting WrongTraders on Guard Hoping for ‘Just Right’ Jobs Data: Markets WrapSupreme Court Lets Transgender Girl Stay on School Track TeamMobileX is a few weeks into the launch of an unlimited pay-as-you go plan starting at $20-a-month that includes an artificial intelligence-powered virtual guide that can anticipate a user’s needs and customize plans based on their spending. Another new entrant is Boost Infinite, a $25 a month unlimited service introduced by satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp., which promises to never raise prices on customers that sign up early.Each of these challengers are reselling service provided by one of the big three carriers — AT&amp;T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. or T-Mobile US Inc. — through wholesale agreements known as mobile virtual network operators or MVNOs. Aside from the network payments, the MVNOs have limited overhead, conduct business mostly online, and generally don’t subsidize new phones they way bigger companies do, which helps keep the cost low.Yet these seemingly compelling offers haven’t gained much traction in an otherwise expensive US mobile market, despite offering service quality on par with the rest of the industry and far better prices. That’s left the big three carriers not just unfazed, but thriving.Consumers have been lulled into expensive plans with unlimited data, free phones and complementary streaming services, says MobileX founder and Chief Executive Officer Peter Adderton.“If you wake up the lazy people, the big carriers are going to have a problem,” Adderton said. “And our business is to wake them up.”Story continuesAdderton also founded Boost Mobile in 2001 with hope that the prepaid service could dominate the youth wireless market. The company is now owned by Dish.Price is the No. 1 consideration for people choosing a wireless service, according to Recon Analytics Mobile Intender surveys. Finding a plan that suits the person’s situation and network quality are the other top criteria. But while there are offers that check those boxes, the hoops required to jump through them to move to another carrier can be a turn off.InertiaBrittney Foxhall knows the trouble it takes to switch.A couple of years ago the Chicago law student said she tried to untangle herself from a contract with Sprint Corp. that included a phone lease. She initially canceled with Sprint but her account got moved to T-Mobile when the two merged in 2020. To get out of the contract she had to pay more than $400 in termination fees and return her phone. That became another problem when the phone was lost in transit. After four months and multiple phone calls, Foxhall got the balance erased. After that headache, she says she’s now content with an AT&amp;T group plan she shares with her brother and his girlfriend.“Spending $100 for my phone bill is a negligible expense,” she said. “I didn’t have much interest in looking around to lower the cost.”That sort of comfortable inertia continues to be fortuitous for the big carriers. The churn rate, or pace of mobile phone subscribers switching service, has been hovering near or below a record low of 1% a month for more than a year. Customers even remained loyal through a round of inflation-related fee increases and price hikes last year.The higher prices along with enticements to get customers to move up to higher tier plans have helped boost the size of the average phone bill over the past three years. T-mobile’s average bill jumped 4.3% while Verizon increased 6.3%.Part of what makes it easier to stay is universal unlimited data. Until about six years ago, wireless customers were billed for the amount of data they used. As Netflix and YouTube gained traction with mobile viewers, data consumption spiked. Commuters downloaded shows onto phones via WiFi to avoid penalties and families bickered over who was running over their limits.‘Unlimited’ GamechangerThe annoyance and stress of metered data plans started to recede soon after T-Mobile’s introduction of an unlimited data plan in 2016. AT&amp;T and Verizon launched their own unlimited offers in the following months.These offers aren’t truly unlimited, however. Nearly every unlimited wireless plan comes with a specific data threshold. If a subscriber blows through their allotment, instead of incurring added costs, the carrier will slow the connection speed.“If the choice is between throttling them and cutting them off, it’s a no-brainer to keep the customer engaged at a slightly lower speed,” said Maribel Lopez with Lopez Research, which tracks trends in the mobile and telecom industries.As unlimited data plans gained popularity, bills became more predictable as so-called overage charges disappeared. That made it less necessary or enticing to shop around.“Customers don’t like those surprises,” said Lisa Pierce, an analyst with market researcher Gartner Inc. Unlimited plans “removed a good amount of anxiety.”It’s been a winning strategy for the big carriers, but it’s also a vulnerability, says Adderton.MobileX is designed to learn people’s data habits as they go along and provide enough headroom to cover a typical month. On the occasion people do have bigger data demands, the program will prompt them to bump up the allotment, Adderton said.Big carriers “charge you extra so you don’t have to worry if you run over. That’s a business model waiting for disruption,” Adderton said.And while the pandemic proved that people regard services like mobile as essential and therefore resilient to consumer spending cuts, that could change.“If the job market softens, people will start looking at their wireless bills,” Pierce said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekScaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital Was Spiraling, and Then Came FTXApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaWhat to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New WorldXi Jinping Launches a Charm Offensive to Repair China’s Tattered ImageThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense Contractors©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The design cycle, she argues, is very much like the STEM process: You get an idea, draft it out and then step back and redesign. Fuller explains, ""The scientific process is that you basically test your hypothesis. In art, you're testing your idea.""Fuller argues that art and science have much in common: ""In order to be any kind of scientist, you have to have a curiosity, and you have to observe the world, and all of that is art.""In her art classes at Shenandoah Middle School Museums Magnet in Miami, FL, students use technology, including 1-1 devices provided by Verizon Innovative Learning to analyze plants, insects and more, all through the eyes of an artist. ""They think they are doing nothing, but they are doing so much,"" Fuller says. ""They are doing science.""While students inspected the school grounds for plants and insects to classify through the use of an app, sixth grade student Karen Eglantin commented on the hands-on nature of art, saying, ""I learned about real life things, not just from a book.""When inside the classroom, Fuller regularly uses a document camera - a device that can project and magnify images - to zoom in on her hand and what she is drawing. She then projects her artwork onto each student's individual device.""They all have access to what I'm drawing from their desk,"" Fuller explains. ""They can raise their hands and say, ‘Wait, I didn't see that. Can you do that again?'""Fuller's passion for art extends to the social and emotional growth of students. ""The most exciting moment for me is [when] students find and discover something with their eyes,"" she says.

But after those AI models are trained, they are put to wider use in what is called ""inference"" by doing tasks like generating text responses to prompts and deciding whether an image contains a cat.Analysts believe that the market for data center inference chips will grow quickly as businesses put AI technologies into their products, but companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google are already exploring how to keep the lid on the extra costs that doing so will add.One of those major costs is electricity, and Qualcomm has used its history designing chips for battery-powered devices such as smartphones to create a chip called the Cloud AI 100 that aims for parsimonious power consumption.In testing data published on Wednesday by MLCommons, an engineering consortium that maintains testing benchmarks widely used in the AI chip industry, Qualcomm's AI 100 beat Nvidia's flagship H100 chip at classifying images, based on how many data center server queries each chip can carry out per watt.Qualcomm's chips hit 227.4 server queries per watt versus 108.4 queries per watt for Nvidia.Qualcomm also beat Nvidia at object detection with a score of 3.8 queries per watt versus Nvidia's 2.4 queries per watt. Object detection can be used in applications like analyzing footage from retail stores to see where shoppers go most often.Nvidia, however, took the top spot in both absolute performance terms and power efficiency terms in a test of natural language processing, which is the AI technology most widely used in systems like chatbots. Nvidia hit 10.8 queries per watt, while Qualcomm ranked second at 8.9 queries per watt.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Simao)]"

To that point, AutoZone is one of the leading specialty retailers and distributors of auto parts in the U.S. with over 6,000 stores in the Americas including Mexico and Brazil.AutoZone stores offer wide-ranging products for cars, SUVs, vans, and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive parts.As for Genuine Parts, the company distributes automotive and industrial replacement parts and materials with a network of more than 10,600 locations across 17 countries.Primarily under the brand name National Automotive Parts Association (NAPA) the automotive segment provides products and services for substantially all domestic and foreign motor vehicles.Genuine Parts’ industrial segment operates as Motion Industries Inc. (Motion) and provides industrial replacement parts and related supplies such as bearings, mechanical and electrical power transmission products, industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and pneumatic components, industrial and safety supplies, and material handling products.Performance &amp; ValuationYear to date, AutoZone stock is up +1% Vs. Genuine Parts -6% with both trailing the S&amp;P 500’s +7%. However, over the last three years, AutoZone stock has soared +186% with Genuine Parts climbing +142% to easily top the benchmark.Trading around $2,500 per share and only 4% from its 52-week high, AutoZone stock has a forward P/E of 19.5X. In comparison, Genuine Parts stock is 14% off its highs at $162 a share and trades at 18.4X forward earnings.Story continuesGenuine Parts’ P/E valuation is below the S&amp;P 500’s 18.9X but above the Automotive-Replacement Parts industry’s 14.5X. Still, Genuine Parts is an industry leader and trades 21% below its decade high of 23.4X and slightly beneath the median of 18.9X.AutoZone stock trades just above the benchmark’s P/E valuation but slightly below its Automotive-Retail and Wholesale Parts industry average of 21X. Shares of AZN trade 6% below their own decade-long high of 20.7X but 15% above the median of 16.9X.Growth &amp; OutlookAutoZone earnings are now expected to rise 9% in fiscal 2023 and jump another 12% in FY24 at $143.75 per share. Plus, earnings estimate revisions have gone up for both FY23 and FY24 throughout the quarter. Sales are forecasted to be up 7% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 to $18.19 billion. More impressive, Fiscal 2024 would be a 53% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $11.86 billion.Pivoting to Genuine Parts, earnings are projected to rise 7% this year and jump another 7% in FY24 at $9.57 per share. Even better, earnings estimates have also gone up for GPC over the last 90 days.On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 5% this year and edge up another 4% in FY24 to $24.21 billion. Fiscal 2024 would represent 25% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $19.39 billion.Bottom LineAutoZone and Genuine Parts stock land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. The rising earnings estimate revisions offer further support to both companies’ P/E valuations.Furthermore, with the used car market very prosperous at the moment this may continue to benefit AutoZone and Genuine Parts in the foreseeable future and lead to more upside in their stocks.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

However, industry participants like Warner Bros. Discovery, Fox Corp. and fuboTV are benefiting from a huge spike in digital content consumption. Diversified content offerings, which are original, regional, short and suitable for small screens (smartphones and tablets); improved Internet speed and penetration, and technological advancement are benefiting industry participants. As monetization and revenues, in terms of ad-spend, continue to be subdued, profit protection and cash management, with greater technology integration, have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving the top line in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry comprises companies offering entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction and musical content over television, radio and digital media platforms. These companies majorly derive revenues from the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions.Notably, these industry players are increasing their spending on research and development, as well as sales and marketing, in order to stay afloat in an era of technological advancements, with increased demand for VR and Internet Radio. The industry is likely to be focused on sustenance at current levels, along with a renewed emphasis on flexibility, which would accelerate the move to a variable cost model and reduce fixed costs.4 Broadcast Radio and Television Industry Trends to WatchShift in Consumer Preference a Key Catalyst: To adapt to the changes in the industry, companies are coming up with varied content for over-the-top (OTT) services in addition to linear TV. The availability of streaming services on a wide range of platforms is helping these services reach a global audience. It is also helping them expand their international user base, which, in turn, attracts advertisers to their platforms, boosting ad revenues.Story continuesThe use of services to help advertisers measure their ROI and enhance their use cases is expected to benefit advertisers and industry participants. Major leagues and events such as NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections attract significant ad revenues as well.Increased Digital Viewing Aids Content Demand: Many industry participants, who are either launching their OTT services or acquiring other OTT services, are banking on user insights to deliver the right content. Increased digital viewing is making consumer data easily available to companies, allowing them to apply AI and machine-learning techniques to create/procure targeted content. The move not only boosts user engagement but also allows industry participants to raise the prices of their services at an appropriate time without the fear of losing subscribers.Uncertain Macro-Economic Scenario Hurts Production and Ad Demand: Advertising is a major revenue source for Broadcast Radio and Television industry. Industry participants are bearing the brunt of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, raised capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and an anticipated recession, which encouraged advertisers to trim ad budgets and are expected to impact their top-line growth in the near term. Moreover, the industry players are facing stiff competition from tech and social media companies for ad dollars. This has been a major impediment to industry participants’ growth.Low-Priced Skinny Bundles Affect Revenues: Increased cord-cutting has forced industry participants to offer “skinny bundles.” These services, which are available through the Internet, often contain fewer channels than a traditional subscription and, therefore, are cheaper. The move is in line with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration, and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing.The alternative services are expected to keep users glued to their platforms, increasing the need to produce additional content. However, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen top-line growth for the industry players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

252,5a40b5b2-779b-30d2-b96d-7b3de2e689db,FOX,2023-04-06,Jury in defamation suit against Fox won't hear about Jan. 6,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jury-defamation-suit-against-fox-212644091.html,1680730004,STORY,['FOXA'],"[DOVER, Del. (AP) — The upcoming trial in a voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit against Fox News for airing false allegations of vote fraud in the 2020 presidential election will not include testimony about the Jan. 6 uprising at the U.S. Capitol, a judge ruled Wednesday.Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems claims that Fox program hosts, with the knowledge of executives for both Fox News and parent company Fox Corp., repeatedly allowed allies of former President Donald Trump to falsely claim that the machines and the software the company used were responsible for Trump’s election loss. Documents released during the lawsuit have shown that top Fox executives and personalities didn’t believe the claims but aired them anyway.“I don’t see Jan. 6 as relevant in this case,” Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said during a hearing Wednesday. “I know that probably shocks everyone.”The trial is set to begin April 17. Davis ruled last week that the statements that were aired were false, but he said a jury must decide whether Fox News acted with actual malice, whether Fox Corp. participated in the publication of the statements, and whether Dominion is entitled to any damages. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion.Dominion has specifically alleged that it was defamed by comments made on 17 programs that aired between Nov. 8, 2020, and Jan. 26, 2021, and in three tweets from former Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs.Davis noted that only one of the challenged programs aired after Jan. 6, and that it contained no mention of the uprising. That show was a Jan. 26 Tucker Carlson program in which My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell complained that he was the victim of “cancel culture” and asserted that he had found evidence of “machine fraud.”“What parties were thinking in January is not very relevant, if at all, to what happened in November and December,” the judge said, adding that allowing any testimony about Jan. 6 could result in unfair prejudice to Fox.Story continues“Fox is not the cause of Jan. 6 in its relation to Dominion,” Davis added. “I do think that’s a really big issue that has to be stayed away from.”Dominion alleged in its complaint that some Fox viewers believed the lies about the company ""with such devotion that they took the fight from social media to the United States Capitol and at rallies across the country to #StopTheSteal, inflicting violence, terror, and death along the way.""In another ruling, Davis denied requests from Dominion attorneys to compel certain executives for Fox News and Fox Corp., including several producers, to testify in person at the trial.Under Delaware law, Davis can compel officers, directors and managing agents of a Delaware corporation to appear in court to testify. He has already indicated that he can compel court appearances by Fox Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, director Paul Ryan, and Viet Dinh, chief legal and policy officer. Fox attorneys have nevertheless argued that 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch should not be forced to testify in person after having been deposed for seven hours.Meanwhile, Dominion asked Davis to compel live testimony of six other Fox officials, arguing that their high-level positions and discretionary acts made them “managing agents” for the defendants. The judge said he could compel the appearance only of Tom Lowell, senior executive vice president and managing editor for both Fox News and Fox Business. In doing so, he noted that Lowell had previously been chosen by Fox News to be deposed as a representative of the company.Dominion was unsuccessful in seeking to compel live testimony from Fox officials including Jerry Andrews, executive producer of the Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro show, and Gary Schreier, senior vice president of programming for Fox Business. They also sought to force live testimony from Irena Briganti senior vice president of corporate communications for Fox News Media; Ron Mitchell, vice president of primetime programming and analytics, and Raj Shah, a senior vice president at Fox Corp. who is responsible for “brand protection.”Davis refused to force those officials to travel to Delaware, but noted that Dominion could still seek to introduce their testimony through depositions, or even remotely through Zoom.The judge ended the hearing by encouraging attorneys to make final decisions on whom they plan to call as live witnesses, so that court personnel can begin making any necessary security preparations.]"

However, industry participants like Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, Fox Corporation FOXA and fuboTV FUBO are benefiting from a huge spike in digital content consumption. Diversified content offerings, which are original, regional, short and suitable for small screens (smartphones and tablets); improved Internet speed and penetration, and technological advancement are benefiting industry participants. As monetization and revenues, in terms of ad-spend, continue to be subdued, profit protection and cash management, with greater technology integration, have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving the top line in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry comprises companies offering entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction and musical content over television, radio and digital media platforms.

Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) three years ago are up 41%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-c-h-robinson-133450893.html,1680701690,STORY,['CHRW'],"[Buying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. For example, the C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) share price return of 32% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 6.7% in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.C.H. Robinson Worldwide was able to grow its EPS at 24% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 11.73.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on C.H. Robinson Worldwide's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for C.H. Robinson Worldwide the TSR over the last 3 years was 41%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, C.H. Robinson Worldwide shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 4.6% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 10%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 2% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for C.H. Robinson Worldwide (1 can't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

""Companies and utilities across the country will use those products to make clean hydrogen. And trucks made in America with zero-emission engines will be powered by clean hydrogen.""Coinciding with the visit, Cummins, a global power technology leader, announced that in addition to recent investments in Fridley, the company is investing more than $1 billion across its U.S. engine manufacturing network in Indiana, North Carolina and New York.The investment will provide upgrades to those facilities to support the industry's first fuel agnostic engine platforms capable of running on low carbon fuels, including natural gas, diesel and eventually hydrogen, helping to begin decarbonizing the nation's truck fleets today.""The electrolyzer production in Minnesota and investment in our Indiana, North Carolina and New York facilities are reflective of our dual path approach of advancing both engine-based and zero-emission solutions - an approach that is best for all of our stakeholders and our impact on the planet,"" said Cummins President and CEO Jennifer Rumsey. ""We can't do this alone and are grateful for the continued partnership and collaboration with congressional leaders and the Biden Administration.""The Inflation Reduction Act included the largest investment in climate and energy in U.S. history. Cummins was an outspoken advocate for passage. Rumsey appeared at several forums voicing her support, including one where she joined Biden, General Motors CEO Mary Barra and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen.Story continuesAn electrolyzer splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas or liquid and used as an energy-dense, clean power source to help decarbonize a variety of hard-to-abate sectors. Hydrogen is considered ""green"" if it is produced using renewable energy.Cummins' Destination Zero strategy is designed to develop low- and no-carbon technologies for applications where it makes sense, while improving the company's core technologies so customers in applications that will take longer to decarbonize can begin reducing carbon immediately rather than wait.Cummins Inc., Wednesday, April 5, 2023, Press release pictureCummins Inc. employee Brandon Moore, Training Program Leader, introduced the president before his address at the company's Fridley, Minnesota, plant.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/747816/Presidential-Visit-Highlights-Cummins-Innovation-To-Promote-a-Cleaner-Environment]"

Only people in Hollywood talk about box office,” he continued.Cost controversyPerlmutter was the chairman and CEO of Marvel Entertainment before Disney acquired the comics company for $4 billion in 2009. Perlmutter remained as Marvel's chairman and is now one of Disney's largest individual shareholders.Perlmutter has long griped about the high cost of Marvel films, putting him at odds with others at Disney.In 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger removed Perlmutter as the head of Marvel Studios due to a dispute over the budget for ""Dr. Strange.""Earlier this year, Iger—now in his second stint as Disney’s CEO—claimed on CNBC that Perlmutter had tried to fire Kevin Feige, the producer for Marvel's films, forcing Iger to step in “to prevent that from happening.” (Perlmutter told the Wall Street Journal he never tried to fire Feige, who is now the president of Marvel Studios.)Disney's Marvel films have grossed $23 billion at the global box office.Iger also claimed in his 2019 memoir that he had told Perlmutter to order his team to stop “putting up roadblocks” to films starring Marvel’s female and Black superheroes.“Black Panther,” released in 2018, has the second-highest box office for a Disney-produced Marvel film.Story continuesBy the time he was fired, Perlmutter was in charge of just Marvel’s comics publishing and licensing businesses, with both Marvel's film and TV divisions reporting directly to Disney.Yet Perlmutter said he continued to complain about the high costs of Marvel movies.He even claimed that former Disney CEO Bob Chapek, who was unceremoniously booted from the position earlier this year in favor of a returning Iger, agreed with the high spending, yet was powerless to change things.“There was no way to force the issue because the creative people at the Walt Disney Company are very powerful,” Perlmutter told the Wall Street Journal. The Walt Disney Company did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment, but a Disney spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the company told Perlmutter that his termination was part of the broader layoffs.Backing Nelson PeltzPerlmutter confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that he supported the campaign by activist investor Nelson Peltz for a board seat at Disney.In stock exchange filings earlier this year, Disney revealed that Perlmutter was lobbying for Peltz behind the scenes.In January, Peltz said he wanted to “restore the magic” at Disney, criticizing the company for poor succession planning, an expensive streaming strategy and costly acquisitions.Petlz ended his campaign after Disney announced that it would launch a massive restructuring plan, cutting $5.5 billion in costs and 7,000 jobs.“If a guy is going to do everything you wanted him to do, where’s the argument?” Peltz told Fortune in an interview after ending his campaign for a board seat.Disney’s layoffs, which started last week, go beyond Perlmutter.The company has cut jobs in its television production and content acquisition divisions, and shuttered its metaverse department.Another casualty of the restructuring is Marvel Entertainment, whose divisions are being integrated into other parts of Disney, according to the New York Times.In his interview with the Journal, Perlmutter still supported his efforts to get Peltz a board seat—even if they helped trigger the measures that led to his firing.“I learned one thing about creative people my whole life,” Perlmutter said. “You cannot give them an open credit card.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresThe young creators of a ""TED meets Burning Man"" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

Disney doesn’t have the right to get involved with politics, and you know, I’m the largest individual shareholder.""Perlmutter, who owns a reported 30 million shares of the company, equating to roughly $3 billion, said he warned executives, ""Don’t get involved in politics.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)Perlmutter's comments come after CEO Bob Iger defended the company's actions during its annual meeting of shareholders on Monday.""A company has a right to freedom of speech just like individuals do,"" Iger said, adding DeSantis' policies are ""anti-business"" and ""anti-Florida"" as the politician looks to strip Disney of its self-governing powers.The fight stems from what has largely been seen as a politically-targeted response over the Disney's reaction to the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" law, which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade. In 2022, then-CEO Bob Chapek denounced it at the company's annual shareholder meeting after initially deciding not to speak publicly on the matter.In response, DeSantis signed a bill into law that allows him to take control of the company's long-standing special tax district, formerly known as Reedy Creek.Earlier on Monday, DeSantis asked Florida's inspector general to look into a last minute agreement signed by the previous Reedy Creek board that essentially renders the new oversight committee, appointed by DeSantis, powerless.Story continuesWalt Disney CEO Bob Iger attends the European premiere of ""The Lion King"" in London, Britain July 14, 2019. REUTERS/Henry NichollsThe company is looking to slash $5.5 billion in costs. More job cuts will hit the media giant later this month and right before the summer to reach the previously announced 7,000-job target, Iger said in an internal memo obtained by Yahoo Finance.In addition to the layoffs announced in February, Disney also disclosed plans to restructure the organization into three core business segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.At the time, Iger said the new strategic organization, ""will result in a more cost-effective coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations.""Perlmutter told The Journal he's convinced he was fired because he pushed for more aggressive cost-cutting: ""I have no doubt that my termination was based on fundamental differences in business between my thinking and Disney leadership, because I care about return on investment.""Perlmutter said he repeatedly expressed concerns over the company's excessive spending, particularly around its Marvel film productions.""All they talk about is box office, box office,"" Perlmutter said. ""I care about the bottom line. I don’t care how big the box office is. Only people in Hollywood talk about box office.""Overall, Perlmutter said his firing was ""merely a convenient excuse to get rid of a longtime executive who dared to challenge the company’s way of doing business.""The former executive's concerns echoed those of activist Nelson Peltz, who staged a highly publicized proxy battle with Disney in an effort to push for additional cost cuts, operational adjustments, a post-Iger successor, and a reinstatement of the company's dividend.Peltz officially ended his fight in February after the company announced its restructuring plans.""My experience with any major corporation, when they’re having problems and they don’t have the free cash or whatever it is, usually people like Nelson Peltz know how to put it back on track,"" Perlmutter said.""I learned one thing about creative people my whole life: You cannot give them an open credit card.…They’re doing this for 30 years, why would they change?""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Juniper Networks is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that JNPR has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.08, while MSI has a forward P/E of 25.58. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 2.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.84.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.48. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MSI has a P/B of 364.91.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, JNPR holds a Value grade of B, while MSI has a Value grade of C.JNPR sticks out from MSI in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that JNPR is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The buyout is likely to augment Cradlepoint’s Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) framework and zero trust offerings for hybrid 5G and wireline environments.SASE is a security framework that converges software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) and zero trust security solutions into a converged cloud-delivered platform that securely connects users, systems, endpoints and remote networks to apps and resources. This is expected to facilitate the development of the new Cradlepoint NetCloud Threat Defense cloud service, which will expand its mobile-capable and router-integrated SASE and zero trust portfolio for fixed-site, remote worker, in-vehicle and IoT use cases.The acquisition will leverage Cradlepoint’s enterprise networking expertise and Ericom’s innovative SSE and zero trust security solutions to help address the growing cybersecurity needs of global enterprises as they accelerate the rapid adoption of 5G technologies. The transaction will enable the delivery of a comprehensive SD-WAN and SASE solution for Wireless WAN and private cellular networking for cloud-based secure network solutions. This, in turn, will strengthen Ericsson’s market position as a leading mobile infrastructure provider and establish a focused enterprise business.Ericsson is the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. With the emergence of the smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has recently increased manifold. Further, to maintain superior performance as traffic increases, there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity.The company is focusing on 5G system development.

271,0ded5645-f1db-3740-9b2d-aa567d074857,JNPR,2023-04-06,Knowles (KN) Unveils Voice Sensor for Greater Sound Clarity,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/knowles-kn-unveils-voice-sensor-133101823.html,1680701461,STORY,"['KN', 'NOKIA.HE', 'JNPR', 'ANET']","[Knowles Corporation KN recently unveiled a digital voice vibration sensor to improve sound clarity in noisy environments. Dubbed V2S200D, this high bandwidth, low-power vibration sensor works in conjunction with microphones to suppress surrounding sounds and accentuate the speaker’s voice to improve the call quality.Consumer audio devices such as True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds for voice communication on the move are much in vogue. These often lead to muffled communication in public places. In addition, high winds and traffic snarls diffuse the sound clarity with unwanted noises that are, at times, difficult to remove with traditional noise suppression techniques.This is where V2S200D comes in handy with its unique ability to selectively pick up the speaker’s voice while suppressing all other sounds. Together with TWS microphones, it offers a consistent sound quality along with features such as voice activity detection, imposter rejection and personalization.  The product’s small size, high signal-to-noise ratio and low power consumption attributes further make it a compelling option for OEMs to enhance user experience. Moreover, a digital mic with Pulse Density Modulation interface for seamless hardware integration and software development is likely to increase its appeal as Knowles aims for mass production later this year.Leveraging its leading position in MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) microphones and strong capabilities in audio processing technologies, Knowles optimizes audio systems and improves user experience in mobile, ear and IoT applications. Its MEMS microphone is the smallest of its kind, with the highest signal-to-noise ratio at the lowest power, while the balanced armature speakers offer the greatest output at the lowest power.Proprietary manufacturing techniques and global scale of operations have facilitated the company to fine-tune its business with the evolving customer demands and invest in high-value solutions. The transformation from an acoustic component supplier to an audio solutions provider has enabled the company to migrate to higher-value solutions and increase content per device. This, in turn, has empowered it to capitalize on the positive macro trends in audio and edge processing solutions.Moreover, voice-powered interactions are fast emerging as a critical and necessary feature as consumers tend to engage with technology through natural, spoken commands across mobile, ear and IoT platforms. This has led to a wide proliferation of products ranging from mobile phones to headsets and smart speakers to household appliances. Knowles aims to capitalize on its unique capabilities in acoustics, digital signal processing and algorithms to cater to these demands.Knowles boasts an integrated design and manufacturing scale of operations. The company has a unique ability to balance and shift between full and semi-automation to optimize the efficiency of operations and reduce operating expenses. For products introduced more than 18 months ago, Knowles strives to offset expected price erosion through bill of material cost reductions, yield improvements, equipment efficiency and movement to lower-cost manufacturing locations.The stock has lost 15.3% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 4.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKnowles currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

272,cbda8c01-e474-3cd4-b8a7-48533b413916,JNPR,2023-04-06,"Juniper Networks, Inc.'s (NYSE:JNPR) Stock Is Going Strong: Have Financials A Role To Play?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juniper-networks-inc-nyse-jnpr-132430036.html,1680701070,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 11% over the last month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Juniper Networks'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Juniper Networks How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Juniper Networks is:11% = US$471m ÷ US$4.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Juniper Networks' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, Juniper Networks' ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 10%. Despite this, Juniper Networks' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesWe then compared Juniper Networks' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 28% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Juniper Networks''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Juniper Networks Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a high three-year median payout ratio of 77% (implying that the company keeps only 23% of its income) of its business to reinvest into its business), most of Juniper Networks' profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the absence of growth in earnings.Moreover, Juniper Networks has been paying dividends for nine years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 34% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 15%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Juniper Networks has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return. Investors could have benefitted from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. That downside risk was realized by P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 16%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 9.8%. P10 hasn't been listed for long, so although we're wary of recent listings that perform poorly, it may still prove itself with time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 11% in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for P10 While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Even though the P10 share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.With a low yield of 1.3% we doubt that the dividend influences the share price much. P10 managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on P10A Different PerspectiveWe doubt P10 shareholders are happy with the loss of 15% over twelve months (even including dividends). That falls short of the market, which lost 9.8%. That's disappointing, but it's worth keeping in mind that the market-wide selling wouldn't have helped. The share price decline has continued throughout the most recent three months, down 11%, suggesting an absence of enthusiasm from investors. Given the relatively short history of this stock, we'd remain pretty wary until we see some strong business performance. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for P10  that you should be aware of.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category.

URI is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.08, which compares to its industry's average of 13.42.

281,772b8183-552b-3a0b-a56a-4980c90d132b,URI,2023-04-06,Pick These 4 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-4-stocks-impressive-interest-125212866.html,1680699132,STORY,"['URI', 'CAT', 'EXLS', 'FTNT']","[An ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only on the basis of the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues, such as soaring inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and a hawkish monetary policy.Often, investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play — the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Caterpillar Inc. CAT, United Rentals, Inc. URI, Fortinet, Inc. FTNT and ExlService Holdings, Inc. EXLS boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks with a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Caterpillar, which manufactures and sells construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The expected EPS growth rate for three-five years is 12%.

282,2216cae0-df2c-377b-817d-14d2c4de4d84,URI,2023-04-06,7 Growth Stocks That Are Trading at a Bargain Price,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-trading-bargain-182256279.html,1680459776,STORY,"['PFE', 'HBM', 'AAP', 'HAL', 'LOW', 'URI']","[It’s too early to say the market has turned the corner, but some analysts suggest that equities could be at the beginning of a bull market. The banking crisis appears to be contained. And if the Federal Reserve decides to pause the rise in interest rates, these same analysts suggest the rally could turn into something much bigger. That’s why now is a good time to look at buying bargain growth stocks. One metric to use for finding undervalued stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This tells you how much of a price you’re paying per share for every dollar of a company’s earnings. While not a perfect indicator by any means, it can serve as a useful starting point.  At the time of this writing, the current S&amp;P P/E ratio is approximately 21x. A common feature of each of these bargain growth stocks is that they are trading below that average. This makes them good candidates to outperform when the market does return to growth.  PFEPfizer$40.80LOWLowe’s$199.97AAPAdvance Auto Parts$121.61URIUnited Rentals$395.76HALHalliburton$31.64OGNOrganon &amp; Co.$23.52HBMHudbay Minerals$5.25Pfizer (PFE) Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockMultinational biotechnology companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) tend to be a bit predictable if not a little boring. Revenue and profits come from their commercially available medicines. And the best ones have a deep pipeline of drugs and therapeutics in development.  But nothing’s been boring about owning PFE stock in the last two years. The stock rocketed higher when it won the race to earn an emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine, Comirnaty. However, the stock has plunged more than 25% as investors expect demand for the vaccine to wane. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis is an example of where investors have to use a wider lens. In March 2023, Pfizer announced it would pay $43 billion to acquire Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN). This acquisition will enhance Pfizer’s oncology portfolio, and the company expects it to add $10 billion in revenue by 2030.  Story continuesThat’s a long time away, but Pfizer fits into the bargain growth stocks category. The company’s P/E ratio is just over 7x. And analysts give PFE stock a mean price target of $53.10 which is 31% higher than the current price. Plus, the company pays a dividend with an attractive 4.07% yield, and it has been increasing the dividend in each of the last 12 years.  Lowe’s Companies (LOW) A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocksSource: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockAfter the collapse of the housing market, Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) is looking like a bargain growth stock. However, I understand if some investors are wondering when that growth will emerge. Revenue and earnings for the home improvement giant are likely to remain under pressure in 2023 as the housing market will remain sluggish.  That being said, when the housing market does pick up, you’re not going to be able to buy the LOW stock at under $200 a share. If you want to wait to see if the stock will drop to an even more attractive price point, I wouldn’t blame you. But timing the market is always tricky. So it’s a good idea to take a small position now and average cost down if the price does drop. By taking that strategy, you can take advantage of the company’s dividend. Lowe’s is a Dividend King which means the company has increased its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. While the yield of 2.18% isn’t particularly impressive, investors do get a $4.20 per share annual payout which makes the stock a safe place to ride out the current market.  Advance Auto Parts (AAP) A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockThere was a notable item in the last reading of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that should be bullish for Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP). Specifically, the price of used cars went up. This was a reversal of a downward trend that started in the fall of 2022.  That makes it likely that more investors may hold off on making that car purchase and instead apply some of their tax refunds to keeping their existing car in working order. That would certainly justify buying AAP stock which has tumbled over 40% in the past 12 months. But even if revenue and earnings don’t significantly improve from 2022 levels, the stock looks undervalued and oversold. At around 14x earnings, AAP stock is trading at a discount. Buying the stock now gets you an attractive dividend with a yield of over 5%. The payout ratio is over 70% which means there is some concern that the dividend may get cut a little. But with the growth of over 192% in the last three years, investors are still likely to get a nice payout.  United Rentals (URI) A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockTalk about the debt ceiling and curbing government spending dominating the headlines, and with good reason. The federal budget is a mess. But even if the government commits to no new spending in 2023, there are still federal dollars flowing into the economy. That’s because of the Infrastructure Act and Inflation Reduction Act that passed through the last Congress.  And all that spending is bullish for United Rentals (NYSE:URI) as businesses look to get shovels in the ground. URI stock is up 67% from its 52-week low. But it’s also down 19% from its 52-week high set in early March after a downgrade by an analyst at Baird. The argument is that tighter bank lending will constrict spending on capital projects in the private sector. That may be true. But with revenue expected to grow in 2023, it’s a good idea to keep your eye on a stock that is trading at just 12x earnings. And the company recently initiated a dividend which may also help lift the spirit – and total return – of investors.  Halliburton (HAL) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comHeading into 2023, the bears had the upper hand on oil stocks like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). Oil prices were dropping as it appeared that the Federal Reserve’s campaign of raising interest rates was having the expected effect of lowering demand.  But the reopening of China and the refilling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will likely put a firm floor on oil prices that has some analysts saying that $70 is the new $50. If that’s the case, then Halliburton is well positioned to become one of the bargain growth stocks. HAL stock is down 27% since mid-January. At that time, the stock was bumping up against its 52-week high.  With catalysts in place, it would not be hard to see the stock moving past its 52-week high. It’s already up 8% in the last week of March. And if oil climbs to over $90 as some analysts believe can happen, now is the time to get in on a stock that is trading at around 17x earnings.  Organon &amp; Co. (OGN) An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comThere are times when low-priced growth stocks are not bargains. And at first glance, that may seem to be the case with Organon &amp; Co. (NYSE:OGN). The healthcare company’s stock is currently trading at around 6.4x earnings and earnings are expected to decline in the next year.  However, the consensus price target of analysts suggests the stock could have an upside of over 45%. And the stock received a bullish upgrade from Raymond James in March. One catalyst is coming from Organon’s biosimilar division which is launching a biosimilar drug that will compete with Humira from AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).  The stock may also get a boost from its Women’s Health division. Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) spinoff is launching its “Her Plan is Her Power” initiative to reduce unplanned pregnancies. And Bloomberg recently reported that the company is seeing an increase in demand for birth control in states where abortion is restricted. Hudbay Minerals (HBM) Wooded cube block on yellow background with word GROWTH.Source: ShutterstockHudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM) is the last of the bargain growth stocks on this list. And it carries the most risk. However, if you’re going to be investing in a small-cap stock, particularly a mining stock, HBM stock may be a savvy choice. Mining stocks are always a risk, but a small-cap play like Hudbay comes with the opportunity for big rewards.  The reason is the global demand for copper. In all of history, the world has mined 700 million tons of copper. But to reach the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the world will have to mine 1.4 billion tons more. This is probably unrealistic. But it’s a good reason to invest in a mining stock that is expected to post earnings growth of over 39% on average over the next five years. According to the company’s website, Hudbay Minerals is “unique among our peers for our proven ability to discover, finance, build and operate low-cost, long-life, cash-generating assets. We have a robust portfolio of mines and projects focused on copper in mining-friendly, investment-grade jurisdictions.” Analysts give the stock a consensus Hold rating with a price target of $6.85 which is 31% above its current price.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in LOW.

This cloud region will offer wide range of cloud services ranging from modernizing applications to migrating workloads from the company’s data centers to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).The new Oracle Cloud Singapore Region will consist more than 100 OCI services and applications, including Oracle Autonomous Database, MySQL HeatWave Database Service, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes and Oracle Cloud VMware Solution.Currently, Oracle Cloud Regions include nine regions in Asia Pacific, 10 in America, 10 in Europe, three regions in the Middle East, one region in Africa, four government regions and a few National Security regions.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteWhy is Oracle Cloud Better Than Its Competitors?This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is constantly working to be more valuable to the customers than its competitors.

It also offers a wide range of relevant services.Oracle Cloud is competing with giants like Microsoft’s MSFT Azure, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google cloud and Amazon’s AMZN Web Services.According to a OCI report, Oracle Cloud is better than AWS, Azure and Google Cloud because it can migrate and run any workload on Oracle, consume cloud services in any public cloud and it is easy to implement security practices. Oracle Cloud offers lower risks and costs cheaper as well. Azure customers can also access Oracle Database services in OCI as an Azure service without leaving the Azure ecosystem.With growing demand for multi-cloud infrastructures, Oracle should partner with giants rather than competing with those companies.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Oracle (ORCL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ORCL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Oracle's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Oracle's main business drivers.Redwood City, CA-based Oracle Corporation was founded in 1977 and incorporated later in 2005. Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware and application software providers.Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations over the last couple of years. The company offers cloud solutions and services that can be used to build and manage various cloud deployment models.Built upon open industry standards such as SQL, Java and HTML5, Oracle Cloud provides access to application services, platform services and infrastructure services for a subscription. Through its Oracle Enterprise Manager offering, the company manages cloud environments.Oracle's software and hardware products and services include Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Java and Oracle Engineered Systems. Oracle Engineered Systems include Exadata Database Machine, Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Exalytics In-Memory Machine, SPARC SuperCluster, Virtual Compute Alliance, Oracle Database Appliance, Oracle Big Data Appliance and ZFS Storage.With the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in Jan 2010, Oracle began selling hardware products and services, primarily comprising computer server and storage products.Oracle reported revenues of $42.4 billion in fiscal 2022. The company reports its new software licenses under its new Cloud license and on-premise license segment. Further, the company merged its Cloud SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS along with its software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.Total Cloud services and license support revenues came in at $30.2 billion in fiscal 2022. Total cloud license and on-premise license came in at $5.9 billion in fiscal 2022.Oracle faces significant competition in most of its operational markets (database, applications, storage, cloud computing) from the likes of Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, SAP, salesforce.com, Workday and Teradata.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Oracle, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $2,904.37, or a gain of 190.44%, as of April 5, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 162.86% and the price of gold increased 23.02% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are anticipating more upside for ORCL.Oracle is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), bodes well. Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line. Partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft is helping Oracle win new clientele. The company’s share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy. However, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform, amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion. We expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses to jump 14.1% over fiscal 2022.The stock is up 6.38% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 13 higher, for fiscal 2023.

A number of American CEOs, including Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook, traveled to China for the event and celebrated their ties to the second largest economy.It’s not clear if the Biden administration has raised the issue with its Chinese counterparts. The US official didn’t mention specific Chinese actions or whether the Biden administration has plans to respond with its own measures, but the official said there were a number of recent examples of Chinese behavior that fit the pattern.Chinese President Xi Jinping last month reiterated the country needs to move away from reliance on other nations for advanced technology, saying the nation was grappling with “comprehensive containment and suppression by western countries led by the US over the past few years.” The US has sought to use export controls in particular to maintain its technological edge over China, with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan last year saying it was essential to “maintain as large of a lead as possible.”Story continuesChina similarly sees the US export controls and sanctions against its companies as unfair suppression and inconsistent with open trading systems.Last week, Beijing opened a new front in the escalating semiconductor battle between the world’s two largest economies when Chinese authorities announced a cybersecurity probe into imports from Micron Technology Inc., the US’s largest memory-chip maker, citing national security reasons.The Chinese government said in a statement it’s conducting the review to ensure the integrity of its information infrastructure supply chain, prevent network security risks and maintain national security. Micron said in a statement it was in communication with the Cyberspace Administration of China concerning the inquiry and the company is “cooperating fully.”Last month, China raided New York-based due diligence firm Mintz Group’s office in Beijing and detained five of its Chinese employees. China said that Mintz was “suspected of engaging in unlawful business operations,” without elaborating.Days later, Chinese authorities detained a staffer of Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc. on spying charges.The Biden administration has long said it needs new tools to address China’s economic coercion. US officials and lawmakers have been developing ideas but have not announced specifics. The US has also discussed the matter with allies and partners.Japan, which is chairing the Group of Seven this year, has put an emphasis on the issue and is aiming for outcomes by the leaders summit next month, people familiar with the deliberations said.“Coercion is core to China’s economic model,” said Representative Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “The US and its allies must stand together against these mafia-like tactics.”McCaul this week is leading a bipartisan delegation to Asia. The group arrived in Taiwan on Thursday and held meetings with officials in Tokyo and Seoul before that.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond ChinaScaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital Was Spiraling, and Then Came FTXXi Jinping Launches a Charm Offensive to Repair China’s Tattered ImageThanks to Putin, Business Is Booming for Germany’s Defense ContractorsWhat to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New World©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

That would be the smallest profit since 2009. Several profit projections are below 1 trillion won and in some cases just slightly above breakeven.While the semiconductor industry is known for its boom-and-bust cycles, it endured one for the history books during the Covid era. Demand soared during the pandemic as consumers bought new computers and smartphones, prompting chipmakers like Samsung to crank up production. But sales tumbled as lockdowns lifted and then shriveled more with soaring inflation, rising interest rates and other global economic trauma.That left the $160 billion memory chip industry with a yawning mismatch between supply and demand. Inventories spiked. Prices for DRAM and NAND tumbled. Samsung, the biggest player in memory chips, is expected to lose about $2.7 billion in its semiconductor division.“The biggest problem right now is that chip inventories are too high and, in order to reduce them, the company will have to cut production,” said Lee Seung-woo, analyst at Eugene Investment &amp; Securities.Prices for DRAM, a type of memory used to process data in computers and phones, slid 20% in the first quarter and are expected to drop 10% to 15% in the second quarter, according to market research firm TrendForce. NAND storage-chip prices plunged as much as 15% and are expected to fall another 5% to 10% in the second quarter.Story continues“Memory prices declined further than the market’s expectations in the first quarter due to poor demand,” said Baik Gilhyun, analyst at Yuanta Securities. “Prices will fall but at a slower pace in the current quarter. There’s not much further to slide because DRAM and NAND contract prices will soon hit their cash-cost level.”South Korea’s exports of chips slumped 34.5% in March, following a decline of more than 40% in the previous month, according to data released by the country’s trade ministry. Total exports to China, the biggest trade partner of Korea, fell by 33.4% as the world’s second-biggest economy reels from an economic slump.Sanjay Mehrotra, chief executive officer of memory-chip rival Micron Technology Inc., said last week he’s optimistic about a recovery in the market this year as inventory levels decline and demand recovers. Still, any improvement will depend on whether the major chipmakers throttle back production. “The recovery could be accelerated if further supply cuts are made,” he said.Samsung has been the holdout. While Micron, SK Hynix Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. have slashed their spending on investment and cut production in the hopes of stemming further price declines, the largest memory maker has kept up its own expenditures.Samsung — now led by Jay Y. Lee, the founder’s grandson — has said its strategy historically has been to keep spending during downturns to increase its competitive position. The approach can help the company grab market share — and develop new technologies to wield against rivals like Hynix and Micron when they don’t have the cash to keep up.In Pyeongtaek, Samsung’s workers are busily constructing the company’s fourth, gigantic chip production line and planning to add two more lines by end of this decade. Besides memory chips, Samsung is trying to expand its semiconductor foundry business, which is now dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Samsung announced another 300 trillion won ($229 billion) investment for a new mega chip campus in Yongin for the next two decades.While rivals and investors have called on Samsung to follow the path of its competitors and cut production, Samsung seems unlikely to do so. In February, Lee told the company’s executives they “should not be fazed” by the industry’s challenges and keep investing in the future.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInside the IRS’s Shrinking Band of Wealth HuntersA Runner’s Murder in Kenya Opens a Window Into Violence Against WomenThe Business of … DeathThe Fight Over the Abortion Pill Is Just Getting StartedWhat to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New World©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Brands (NYSE:YUM) shareholders have earned a 25% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-nyse-yum-shareholders-130028930.html,1680699628,STORY,['YUM'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) share price is up 84% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 52% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 14% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Yum! Brands In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Yum! Brands achieved compound earnings per share growth of 3.8% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Yum! Brands' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Yum! Brands' TSR for the last 3 years was 95%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Yum! Brands has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 14% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 11% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Yum! Brands (2 don't sit too well with us)  that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

295,c0a5dade-7cc2-3c04-be51-342bf0ca4f7c,MCD,2023-04-06,This man vowed to eat McDonald’s every day for 100 days and has already lost 34 pounds,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/man-vowed-eat-mcdonald-every-192812322.html,1680722892,STORY,['MCD'],"[A 57-year-old Tennessean went viral on TikTok in late February after announcing his commitment to an unconventional approach to weight loss: eating only McDonald’s for 100 days.“I know some of you are thinking that might be crazy, but I’m gonna eat nothing but McDonald's for the next 100 days,” Kevin Maginnis shares in his first-ever TikTok.As day 44 rolls in, Maginnis, who introduces himself to his over 76,000 TikTok followers as bigmaccoaching, has stayed true to his plan. In fact, it has worked, he shares with his newfound following. He has lost 34 pounds thus far and reports having improved cholesterol levels.His approach seems counterintuitive, but Maginnis explains the secret sauce to his success with his easy-to-follow daily guidelines. He eats three McDonald's meals daily from anywhere on the menu and does not snack in between. He cuts each meal in half and saves the remaining portion for his next meal. He also chooses a bottle of water instead of soda with each meal. For breakfast, he will sometimes choose the Egg McMuffin and hash brown, cut both in half, and save the rest for either lunch or breakfast the next day.https://www.tiktok.com/@bigmaccoaching/video/7202854510778223914The famed McDonald’s devotee is not bored—at least yet. He celebrated his birthday this week with half of a 10-piece chicken nuggets, apple slices, a couple of dipping sauces, and a “birthday shake”—because McDonald's, unfortunately, doesn't offer drive-through birthday cakes.https://www.tiktok.com/@bigmaccoaching/video/7218373451596238123But Maginnis has faced criticism, with some comments pointing to the renowned film Super Size Me, which documents the negative health outcomes of eating only McDonald's for 30 days and sheds light on the harmful effects of America's fast food industry.Maginnis claps back on the platform, saying for him, it’s “half-size me.” In his mind, portion control overrides food's nutritional value. He responded to one inquirer who asked why he can’t portion-control home-cooked meals—which are minimally processed, have a lower sodium content, and provide more nutrient variety.Story continues“Overeating at home is what got me in trouble; by creating a 'leave the food at the house alone' scenario, it has helped me.”Experts weigh in on the McDonald's-only approachMedical experts are quick to critique Maginnis’s approach.“I have cardiologists that love it and I have cardiologists that hate it,” he said on day 10 of his challenge on the Today show.And while Maginnis doesn’t consider his plan a typical diet, calorie-based weight-loss approaches often fail, experts point out.“Is a calorie a calorie when it comes to weight loss? Technically, yes. That's what is going to work in this situation,”  says Tara Schmidt, lead registered dietitian for the New Mayo Clinic Diet. “The topics that have not yet been addressed, though, are nutrient density (diet quality), balance, and sustainability. Research tells us that any calorie-controlled diet program will work, but most people will experience weight regain when they are no longer able to maintain it.”While portion control can lead to weight loss, weight should not be framed as the sole measurement of health. Solely focusing on weight glosses over the importance of other health metrics integral to maintaining optimal health and a sense of well-being.“In the realm of food choices, it's also notable to consider the quality of food being consumed and its impact on the body,” says Tara Schmidt, lead registered dietitian for the New Mayo Clinic Diet.In fact, the type of foods we eat can help reduce the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes. Highly processed foods, like fried foods, can cause inflammation, putting people at risk for long-term health conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Fast food is also high in sodium and low in fiber, which means it is digested quickly and can induce what feels like a sugar crash, which can negatively affect mood and trigger fatigue.Eating diverse foods is also associated with a stronger gut microbiome, which helps protect us from illness.“By consuming a large number of different plant fibers, that gives the building blocks for the emergence of diverse bacterial populations,” Dr. Richard Day, vice president of medical affairs and clinical development at ADM, a food processing company, previously told Fortune.And the Mediterranean diet—a way of eating based on abundance and the prioritization of a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and plant-based protein—has been associated with longevity. Aiming for 30 different plants a week can improve the gut microbiome, reducing inflammation and improving heart and brain health. While Maginnis can choose from the entire McDonald's menu, the options are still limited, as his videos show.So the McDonald's-or-bust way may not be for everyone.And while Maginnis says he understands other factors can improve his overall health, until day 100, he’s sticking with half of the best of what McDonald's has to offer.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresThe young creators of a ""TED meets Burning Man"" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

McDonald's (MCD), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this world's biggest hamburger chain has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.78%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, McDonald's came out with earnings of $2.59 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46 per share, representing a surprise of 5.28%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.68 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.28%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor McDonald's, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.McDonald's currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.62%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 25, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

297,8a6c12bc-01b1-3563-b4bc-1ccd0d208518,MCD,2023-04-06,MCD Vs SBUX: Which Stock is Better Placed at the Moment?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcd-vs-sbux-stock-better-151803681.html,1680707883,STORY,"['SBUX', 'MCD', 'ARCO']","[The restaurant industry is benefiting from improvement in demand, menu innovation, robust off-premise sales, sales-building efforts and digital initiatives. However, high wages and food cost inflation remain major concerns.Restaurant operators’ focus on digital innovation, sales-building initiatives and cost-saving efforts has been acting as a catalyst. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats, and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth. Restaurant operators are focusing on driverless delivery systems to augment sales amid the COVID-19 crisis. This is anticipated to reduce expenses substantially and ensure safety amid the pandemic as companies do away with delivery personnel.However, the restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time now. A rapid increase in menu prices and COVID-19 are the primary reasons behind traffic erosion. Restaurant operators are grappling with high costs of operations.Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation are concerning. The industry is persistently bearing increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure the company’s margins. The rise in meat and seafood costs, including ribs, prime rib, ribeye, tri-tip and salmon, is hurting the industry.In line with the industry's growth, leading restaurant companies — McDonald's Corporation MCD and Starbucks Corporation SBUX — are trying out different strategies to generate profits. With both companies carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let's analyze and find out which is poised better with respect to different parameters.Price Performance and ValuationShares of McDonald's have gained 12.3% in the past year, whereas Starbucks stock has risen 24.8%.On the basis of the forward 12-month P/E ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing restaurant stocks, the industry is currently trading at 25.45X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 19.52X. McDonald's has an edge with a lower forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.17 than Starbucks' figure of 27.79X.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Estimated Earnings &amp; RevenuesArguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance in determining a stock's potential, as surging profit levels indicate strong prospects (and stock price gains).For the current year, McDonald's earnings per share and sales are expected to improve 3.9% and 4.7%, respectively, year over year. Starbucks’ earnings per share and sales are likely to increase 15.2% and 11.2%, respectively, year over year. Hence, this round goes to Starbucks.FundamentalsMcDonald’s believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding its presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance.Despite unfavorable scenario, the company continues to expand its global footprint. It is planning to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023, including 400 in the United States and IOM segment, and 1,500 (including nearly 900 in China) in the IDL market. The company expects net restaurant unit expansion to contribute 1.5% to 2023 systemwide sales growth in constant currencies.The company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In fourth-quarter 2022, global comps advanced 12.6% compared with 12.3% gain reported in the prior-year quarter. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of comps growth.In the fourth quarter, comps in the United States, international operated markets and international developmental licensed segment rose 10.3%, 12.6% and 16.5%, respectively. The company gained from robust performance in Japan and Brazil.Then again, Starbucks is benefiting from expansion efforts. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, Starbucks opened 459 net new stores worldwide, bringing the total store count to 36,170. In fiscal 2023, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The company expects global store growth to be nearly 7%. Capital expenditure in fiscal 2023 are estimated to be $2.5 billion.The company’s North America comps have impressed investors for the eighth straight quarter and rose 14% in the fiscal first quarter. The segment benefited from 10% growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales. Average ticket and transaction increased 9% and 1%, respectively.Despite the dismal performance in China, the company reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2023.

298,438de22d-e43a-307d-98f8-74d47451db9b,TROW,2023-04-06,Is T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock (PRMSX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-emerging-markets-110011030.html,1680692411,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TROW']","[On the lookout for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? Starting with T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock (PRMSX) should not be a possibility at this time. PRMSX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5 (Strong Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerPRMSX is a part of the T. Rowe Price family of funds, a company based out of Baltimore, MD. Since T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock made its debut in March of 1995, PRMSX has garnered more than $1.88 billion in assets. Eric Moffett is the fund's current manager and has held that role since April of 2021.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of -3.3%, and is in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of -3.5%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of PRMSX over the past three years is 22.41% compared to the category average of 18.89%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 20.07% compared to the category average of 16.65%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. PRMSX has a 5-year beta of 0.73, which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -9.4, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, PRMSX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.20% compared to the category average of 1.13%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, PRMSX is actually more expensive than its peers.Investors should also note, that according to our data, the fund does not have any minimum investment requirements.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock ( PRMSX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and higher fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Equity Report area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

""In some instances, meals are being replaced entirely by multiple snack-sized eating occasions. In effect, meals and snacks are merging, which is redefining their roles.""BofA's Spillane thinks snack brands are poised to take further market share away from traditional food items, setting the stage for good investment opportunities into the space.""We see broad agreement among corporates and investors that snacks offer growth and can create value,"" Spillane said, pointing to opportunities into category leaders like PepsiCo (PEP), Hershey (HSY), Campbell's Soup (CPB), Mondelez (MDLZ), and Utz (UTZ).This photograph taken in Paris on February 1, 2023, shows snacks displayed in a vending machine on a commuter train's platform. (Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images)Underscoring the shift, BofA estimates that the U.S. snacking industry — led by powerhouse names such as PepsiCo, via its Frito Lay business, and Hershey — clocked in a staggering $151 billion in sales last year.The total marks an 8% increase from 2021 and a 7% gain annually over the 2019-2022 peak COVID-19 pandemic period.Excluding ice cream (which is more of a sit-down snack), the snack food category's sales rose a solid 9% year on year in 2022 to $132 billion.Snacks accounted for 29% of total packaged food sales in 2022, Spillane estimated.""While taste, indulgence and convenience are important; consumers increasingly emphasize function (energy/protein/collagen), ingredients (simple/natural), ethnic/flavor exploration (""heat"" is in) into their snacks,"" Spillane said about the snack category's fundamental drivers.The snack revolution.Comments from top leaders in the snacking space to Yahoo Finance shed further light on the major shift in food consumption that looks to be underway post-pandemic.Story continues""Snacking is growing faster than food,"" Hostess Brands CEO Andy Callahan said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""And indulgent snacking is growing faster than snacking overall. So we're in a good position to continue to service consumers.""The Twinkie maker is focused on further leveraging its iconic sweet snack in even easier-to-eat form factors such as Bouncers, Callahan said.Meanwhile, cereal giant Kellogg (K) is so in on snacking that it's splitting up its legendary business to unlock value for shareholders. One business will house cereal brands such as Kellogg Cornflakes, while the other will house snack brands such as Pringles, Cheez-It, and Pop-Tarts.""We do believe that the snacking business is undervalued inside our portfolio today,"" Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).

VRTX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Biotech Stock Roundup: BLUE, ONCT, RNA &amp; MoreThe biotech sector has been in focus in the past week with key pipeline and regulatory updates. Among these, bluebird’s downward trend continued after it reported fourth-quarter results and provided pipeline updates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:bluebird Down on Study Updates, Q4 Results:  Shares of bluebird bio, Inc. have been on the downhill after the company provided updates on the biologics license application (BLA) submission for experimental gene therapy lovo-cel for sickle cell disease (SCD) concurrent with the fourth-quarter results on Mar 29, 2023.In early March, BLUE responded to feedback from the FDA on vector and drug product analytical comparability evaluations completed in December 2022 and submitted additional information related to CMC comparability analyses. The company now states that it expects a response from the FDA within a matter of weeks and will expedite its BLA submission, pending alignment with the FDA on product comparability. The company earlier stated that it will submit the BLA in the first quarter. The delay in BLA submission disappointed investors and shares declined.Concurrently, bluebird reported fourth-quarter revenues of $0.06 million compared with $1.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $102 million. bluebird anticipates reporting commercial revenues in the first quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings of 38 cents per share against a loss of $1.83 in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesbluebird currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Oncternal Down on Strategic Reprioritization Update:  Shares of clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. plunged after it announced a strategic reorganization to extend its cash runway. The reprioritization was undertaken on account of the rapidly changing commercial landscape for Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTK inhibitors). Consequently, the company shelved the phase III and phase I/II study of zilovertamab in combination with Imbruvica.This includes closing two studies of zilovertamab in combination with Imbruvica, the ongoing phase I/II study CIRM-0001 and the phase III study ZILO-301, a global registrational study in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In addition, the company is looking for partnerships and collaborations for executing future late-stage clinical trials of zilovertamab. Other projects and indirect expenses will also be reduced, which is estimated to extend the expected cash runway into 2025. The projected cash runway will support the advancement of two pipeline candidates, ONCT-808 and ONCT-534.Management estimates that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance was $54.3 million at the end of the first quarter. It had 58.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of Mar 31, 2023, and expects the cash balance to support planned operations into 2025.Avidity Down on Study Update: Shares of Avidity Biosciences, Inc. crashed after the company provided an update on phase I/II MARINA study of AOC 1001 in adults with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). In September 2022, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on new participant enrollment in the MARINA study after reviewing the information provided by Avidity related to a serious adverse event reported in a single participant in the 4 mg/kg cohort of the MARINA study.A thorough analysis was conducted by the company in consultation with multiple independent experts. Avidity concluded that the participant most likely experienced an extremely rare neurological event comprising bilateral ischemia in the region of the lateral geniculate nuclei in the thalamus with subsequent hemorrhagic transformation. Avidity could not identify a plausible biological link to any component of AOC 1001, the AOC platform, the transferrin receptor delivery mechanism or the reduction of DMPK.Management stated that discussions are ongoing with FDA regarding the partial clinical hold on new participant enrolment as Avidity continues to provide new AOC 1001 data as it emerges from the MARINA trial. Data from the preliminary assessment of AOC 1001 supports that the targeted dose range is between 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg. Hence, Avidity is concluding the MARINA trial with the 38 participants enrolled at 1mg/kg, 2mg/kg and 4mg/kg of AOC 1001 and will not move forward with the 8 mg/kg dose of AOC 1001.Ascendis Down on Regulatory Update:  Shares of Ascendis Pharma A/S were down after the company announced that FDA identified deficiencies in the company’s new drug application (NDA) filing seeking approval for TransCon PTH (palopegteriparatide) in hypoparathyroidism. The deficiencies were not disclosed in the letter but the FDA stated that it cannot hold further discussions about labeling and post-marketing requirements/commitments.The FDA also stated that this does not reflect their final regulatory decision on the company’s application. However, this has delayed the potential approval of the candidate just a month before the action date and a subsequent launch. Management also confirmed that no safety signals had been identified in the ongoing clinical studies or the expanded access program (EAP) evaluating TransCon PTH in hypoparathyroidism patients.Updates From Vertex:  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. and partner CRISPR Therapeutics completed the submission of the rolling BLAs to the FDA for the investigational treatment exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) for SCD and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT). The BLAs include requests for Priority Review, which would shorten the FDA’s review of the application to eight months from the time of submission compared to a standard review timeline of 12 months.Both companies also entered into a new non-exclusive licensing agreement for the use of CRISPR Therapeutics’ gene editing technology, known as CRISPR/Cas9, to accelerate the development of Vertex’s hypoimmune cell therapies for type 1 diabetes (T1D).PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 1.78% in the past five trading sessions. Among the biotech giants, Moderna has jumped 6.53% during the period. Over the past six months, shares of Gilead have soared 27.99%.

308,bc64be89-5c8f-3e3d-b44b-66f4eb3c11d6,NSC,2023-04-06,PlayAGS and RH have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/playags-rh-highlighted-zacks-bull-121812752.html,1680697092,STORY,"['RH', 'AGS', 'NSC', '^GSPC', 'UNP']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 5, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares PlayAGS AGS as the Bull of the Day and RH RH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United Parcel Service, Inc. UPS and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:PlayAGS is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and it sports an A for Value and an A for Growth.  Despite so many calls for a recession, this name and several others in the gaming industry have been holding up rather well.  Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionPlayAGS, Inc. designs and supplies gaming products and services for the gaming industry in the United States and internationally. It operates through three segments: Electronic Gaming Machines (EGM), Table Products, and Interactive Games (Interactive). PlayAGS, Inc. was incorporated in 2005 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.For PlayAGS, I see three straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and that was all preceded by an earnings meet.  That is not that great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved around for URBN.This quarter has seen estimates improve from a loss of 11 cents to a loss of 8 cents.Next quarter moved from breakeven to a gain of 2 cents.The full fiscal year 2023 has increased from a loss of $0.13 to a gain of $0.01 over the last 30 days.Story continuesNext fiscal year sees estimates move from a loss of $0.02 to a gain of $0.19.Positive movement in earnings helped move this stock to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for AGS is mixed at these levels.  I see a forward earnings multiple of 1095x and that is super lofty, but a result of earnings being just barely positive. The price to book multiple of 5.6x is in line with other names in the industry.  Growth is solid at 16% and margins have seen a dramatic improvement.  If nothing else this stock is worth a deeper look.Bear of the Day:RH is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has seen earnings estimates slide lower in a big way recently.  This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionRH operates as a retailer in the home furnishings and operates under RH Galleries and RH brand names, as well as Waterworks showrooms throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. The company was formerly known as Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. and changed its name to RH in January 2017. RH was incorporated in 2011 and is headquartered in Corte Madera, California.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.In the case of RH, I see three beats and of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate and one earnings miss.  This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower.  For RH I see annual estimates moving lower of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $17.70 to $13.31 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $20.36 to $17.51.  That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions.  That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:These Railroad Stocks Look Attractive with Solid Dividend YieldsThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry continues to suffer from headwinds like raging inflation, higher interest rates, high fuel price and supply-chain disruptions. Even though oil price has declined (down 5.7% in the January-March period) due to recession fears, it remains high. Since fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, an uptick in fuel costs is not a welcome development. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 1.9% over the past three months against the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 8.4% appreciation and 5.6% rise of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like United Parcel Service, Inc. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks with Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.United Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $123.15 billion.UNP pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.30 ($5.20 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.61% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 46% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.02%. (Check United Pacific’s dividend history here).We are impressed with Union Pacific’s consistent efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company hiked its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP’s board of directors increased its quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.30 per share. Notably, Union Pacific has been paying dividends on its common stock for 123 consecutive years. In 2022, UNP paid dividends worth $3,159 million and repurchased shares worth $6,282 million. For 2023, management anticipates a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings).Union Pacific Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteNorfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $48.29 billion.NSC pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.35 ($5.40 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.59% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 36% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 11.95%. (Check Norfolk Southern’s dividend history here).Norfolk Southern Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Norfolk Southern Corporation QuoteWe are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In January 2023, the company's board announced a dividend hike of 9%, thereby raising its quarterly dividend payout from $1.24 per share to $1.35. During 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million.In 2021, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,028 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,390 million. Norfolk Southern's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In 2022, the free cash flow was $2,274 million.Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

""In some instances, meals are being replaced entirely by multiple snack-sized eating occasions. In effect, meals and snacks are merging, which is redefining their roles.""BofA's Spillane thinks snack brands are poised to take further market share away from traditional food items, setting the stage for good investment opportunities into the space.""We see broad agreement among corporates and investors that snacks offer growth and can create value,"" Spillane said, pointing to opportunities into category leaders like PepsiCo (PEP), Hershey (HSY), Campbell's Soup (CPB), Mondelez (MDLZ), and Utz (UTZ).This photograph taken in Paris on February 1, 2023, shows snacks displayed in a vending machine on a commuter train's platform. (Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images)Underscoring the shift, BofA estimates that the U.S. snacking industry — led by powerhouse names such as PepsiCo, via its Frito Lay business, and Hershey — clocked in a staggering $151 billion in sales last year.The total marks an 8% increase from 2021 and a 7% gain annually over the 2019-2022 peak COVID-19 pandemic period.Excluding ice cream (which is more of a sit-down snack), the snack food category's sales rose a solid 9% year on year in 2022 to $132 billion.Snacks accounted for 29% of total packaged food sales in 2022, Spillane estimated.""While taste, indulgence and convenience are important; consumers increasingly emphasize function (energy/protein/collagen), ingredients (simple/natural), ethnic/flavor exploration (""heat"" is in) into their snacks,"" Spillane said about the snack category's fundamental drivers.The snack revolution.Comments from top leaders in the snacking space to Yahoo Finance shed further light on the major shift in food consumption that looks to be underway post-pandemic.Story continues""Snacking is growing faster than food,"" Hostess Brands CEO Andy Callahan said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""And indulgent snacking is growing faster than snacking overall. So we're in a good position to continue to service consumers.""The Twinkie maker is focused on further leveraging its iconic sweet snack in even easier-to-eat form factors such as Bouncers, Callahan said.Meanwhile, cereal giant Kellogg (K) is so in on snacking that it's splitting up its legendary business to unlock value for shareholders. One business will house cereal brands such as Kellogg Cornflakes, while the other will house snack brands such as Pringles, Cheez-It, and Pop-Tarts.""We do believe that the snacking business is undervalued inside our portfolio today,"" Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""And we'll prove that as we go forward with the spin. We think it's a very, very again differentiated portfolio, and we believe that we can really unlock value by going forward with the spin.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

311,df86c0d6-46a4-3a97-82b8-913cac516d6a,KO,2023-04-06,Worried About a Market Crash? Buy These 3 Stocks Now.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-market-crash-buy-3-225517837.html,1680476117,STORY,"['KO', 'MCD', 'JPM', '^GSPC']","[Worries about a potential market crash are running high after a run on several regional banks has led to contagion fears. While market crashes are rare, they can happen whenever enough investors panic and start selling stocks. With that in mind, today we’ll look at the best stocks to buy before the market crashes.It’s important to remember that a market crash is not the same as a correction or a bear market. However, in addition to the turmoil in the banking sector, rising interest rates, an inverted yield curve and other key metrics don’t bode well for our chances of escaping a recession. Therefore, whether we see an abrupt fall in stock prices or a more prolonged downturn, it’s good to preemptively consider what stocks might offer a degree of safety in a tumultuous market.Here are the best stocks to buy before the market crashes or enters another leg down.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKOCoca-Cola$62.03JPMJPMorgan Chase$130.31MCDMcDonald’s$279.61Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comOne company that’s survived a market crash or two over the years is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Coca-Cola has been around for more than 135 years and is considered one of the world’s most valuable brands.The blue-chip stock is a great buy-and-hold investment. Just ask Warren Buffett. He first purchased KO stock back in 1998 and currently owns 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion. It’s Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) fifth-largest equity holding.Over the past 20 years, shares are up more than 200%. While this is below the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 340% return during the same period, KO held up much better than the broader market during the past year. Shares are down just over 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 is off nearly 11%.In addition to providing steady capital gains for long-term investors, Coca-Cola is a dividend play. Shares currently yield close to 3%, and the company has earned dividend king status, raising its payout for 61 consecutive years.Story continuesCoca-Cola has continued to grow by expanding its beverage business and branching out into high-margin snack products. The company’s financial picture looks solid despite a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.51, which implies debt plays a big role in the company’s ability to produce growth. While this has contributed to strong return on equity (ROE) numbers in the past, given where interest rates are right now, this is one risk factor to consider. Overall, I think investors looking for the best stocks to buy before the market crashes can’t go wrong with KO.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a buildingSource: ShutterstockFollowing the implosion of several regional banks, depositors have fled to the country’s largest and safest banks.  According to Federal Reserve data, the 25 biggest banks saw $120 billion in deposits in the days immediately following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is one of the banks benefitting from the capital flight. It also helped lead the charge in rescuing First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) to restore confidence in the regional banking sector. The more-than-200-year-old financial institution is the definition of “too big to fail.” Its size is a clear asset that should help it gain market share if we see more turmoil in the banking sector. On the flip side, it is also well-positioned to take advantage of the next growth-fueled bull market rally.JPMorgan is among the most diversified of its large-cap peers, and it is my top pick in the financial sector overall.McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of the best stocks to buy before the market crashes is a name that does well in pretty much every environment: McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).Often touted as a recession-proof stock, MCD even did well during the Great Recession. That’s because McDonald’s core product, low-cost fast food, tends to see an uptick in demand during times of economic stress as people look to stretch their dollars further while still treating themselves.Given the inflationary pressures consumers currently face, it’s not surprising that McDonald’s stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. Over the past year, MCD is up 12% compared to an 11% decline in the S&amp;P 500.The company’s recent financial performance has been robust. Over the past three years, McDonald’s has grown its revenue by an average of 3.8% per year, outperforming 73% of its peers. Additionally, its net margin of 26.7% is better than nearly 97% of its competitors. Finally, the stock yields 2.2%, further adding to its appeal as a long-term defensive investment. On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in KO. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Shares of the company are down 9.6% in the year so far compared to the industry’s decline of 6.4%.Incyte suffered a setback last month after the company announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, for once-daily (QD) use in the treatment of certain types of myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).The CRL stated that the FDA could not approve the new drug application (NDA) in its present form. The regulatory body acknowledged that the study submitted in the NDA met its objective of bioequivalence based on area under the curve (AUC) parameters but identified additional requirements for approval. Shares fell on the news.We note that ruxolitinib is approved under the brand name Jakafi for these indications.The NDA was based on two studies designed to show that ruxolitinib XR tablets are dosage strength proportional and bioequivalent to Jakafi tablets. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncyte also decided to discontinue the phase III LIMBER-304 trial following the results of a pre-planned interim analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). This indicated that the study is unlikely to meet the primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat patient population. The recommendation to stop the study was not due to safety. LIMBER-304 is a randomized, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of parsaclisib plus Jakafi versus placebo plus Jakafi in adult (age ≥18 years) patients living with myelofibrosis (MF) who have an inadequate response to Jakafi monotherapy.These setbacks were disappointing as the company is looking to strengthen its portfolio.On a positive note, the FDA approved Zynyz (retifanlimab-dlwr), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), for the treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The biologics license application (BLA) for Zynyz for this indication has been approved under accelerated approval by the FDA based on the tumor response rate and duration of response (DOR). The continued approval of Zynyz for this indication may be contingent on the verification and description of clinical benefits in confirmatory trials.Story continuesApproval of additional drugs will add an incremental stream of revenues to the top line and reduce the company’s dependence on Jakafi. Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi.The uptake of the recently approved cream formulation of ruxolitinib, Opzelura, has been strong. In July 2022, the FDA approved Opzelura cream 1.5% for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Opzelura is also approved by the FDA for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).Hence, Incyte should be able to maintain momentum despite these setbacks.Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Tracking the purchases made by leading investors is one way. Following the recommendations of stock experts at one of Wall Street’s most well-known banks is another. Then there’s also the option to ride the latest trend.So, when all three of these possibilities combine, investors should really take note.Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the details on two stocks that tick all those boxes. These stocks have been endorsed by a billionaire investor, Ken Griffin, whose hedge fund Citadel generated record profits of $16 billion last year – even against a backdrop of harsh bear market conditions. Additionally, one of the Street’s most prominent banking institutions, Goldman Sachs, has recommended investors to consider investing in these stocks as well.And as for the latest trend? Both names are making use of 2023’s hot topic: Generative AI, a rising trend, that via the release of ChatGPT and the possibilities it represents across multiple industries, has been getting huge amounts of attention this year. In fact, Goldman Sachs reckons adoption could result in nearly $7 trillion in global economic growth over the next 10 years.So, let’s see why Griffin and Goldman both believe these generative AI stocks are ones that could make the most of that opportunity.Intuit Inc. (INTU)We’ll start with Intuit, a leading financial software provider. With its QuickBooks platform, the company has approximately an 82% market share of the U.S.’s SMB accounting software market. But the legacy software company has expanded its remit by adding various other products. Intuit’s offerings also include credit monitoring service Credit Karma, email marketing platform Mailchimp, personal finance app Mint, and tax preparation application TurboTax.The company is also one of the pioneers in the effective implementation of AI-driven consumer-facing solutions; Intuit uses AI in a large-scale for its Virtual Expert Platform, which via the personalization of every taxpayer’s journey and by linking users with tax professionals, powers TurboTax Live.Story continuesThe company’s solutions helped Intuit dial in a strong recent quarterly report, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (January quarter). Revenue rose by 14% year-over-year to $3.04 billion, while beating the Street’s call by $130 million. Adj. EPS of $2.20 compared well to the $1.55 delivered in the same quarter last year while trumping the Street’s $1.44 forecast. The company also repurchased $500 million of shares, with $2.5 billion left on its share repurchase authorization.Obviously, Griffin likes what’s on offer here. During Q4, he bought 269,000 shares, upping his INTU stake by 179%. He now owns 419,615 shares, currently worth $184.55 million.Reflecting Griffin’s confidence, Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan sees a bright future for the company.“The company’s natural language processing, AI tools (that can extract the needed tools from key tax forms, for example) and chatbot services (which use customer’s text and interactions to generate the best response) are additional examples of Intuit’s investment in such technology that can improve its product offering and user retention over time,” the analyst explained.“Intuit has built a strong reputation of investing ahead of the curve in terms of next-gen technology and embodying that into its product framework for future innovation. This leads us to expect Intuit to have the same mentality when building new products and growing existing services, such as QuickBooks Live Mailchimp and Credit Karma,” Rangan added.These comments form the basis for Rangan’s Buy rating while his $575 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 31%. (To watch Rangan’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 13 Buys, 2 Holds and 1 Sell, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See INTU stock forecast)Adobe Inc. (ADBE)The next Griffin/Goldman-endorsed stock has a long history of being at the forefront of technological innovation. Software giant Adobe is the maker of famous products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe Flash, Premiere and the PDF.Therefore, it’s not surprising to learn the company’s AI/ML investments go back a while – to the 2016 release of Sensei, its artificial intelligence tool that integrates under the hood with Adobe software and is a component of different Adobe programs, such as Photoshop and Premiere Pro, amongst others.More recently, the company announced Firefly, a “family” of generative AI tools aimed at creators. A beta version has been released and Adobe intends to eventually integrate it into apps. That should help further expansion for a company with a strong history of growth, as was the case again in its first quarter fiscal year 2023 report (February quarter). Revenue reached a record $4.66 billion, amounting to a 9.4% year-over-year increase and coming in ahead of the consensus estimate by $40 million. Adj. EPS of $3.80 also came in above the $3.68 analysts were predicting. And during the quarter, Adobe repurchased around 5 million shares.They are not the only ones to have bought shares in recent times. Griffin loaded up on 772,857 shares in 4Q22. That almost doubled his holdings; in total, Griffin now counts 1,575,124 ADBE shares in his portfolio, presently worth $607 million.Goldman’s Rangan also covers ADBE and he believes the AI offerings set Adobe up well for the future. He writes, “The release of Sensei GenAi (focused on Digital Experience use cases) and Firefly (a suite of new Generative AI solutions across its portfolio), further situate Adobe to help shape the role Generative AI will play in driving productivity boosts expected to be a by-product of greater adoption. For example, these products can jump start the ideation process, extract more value from the same assets (by allowing for a broad range of seamless editing to take place via Adobe Express), automatically generate campaign analytics or build customer journeys.”“Adobe’s strong direct-to-consumer go-to-market motion, along with its product led growth will likely allow Adobe to drive net-new user growth and be one of the first benefactors of these investments, especially in its Creative Cloud and wider Digital Media business,” Rangan summed up.How does it all translate to investors? Rangan rates the shares a Buy while his $480 price target implies one-year appreciation of 23% lies in store.Looking at the ratings breakdown, with 11 Buys and 14 Holds, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Moderate Buy.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Consolidated Edison (ED) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.75 a share 29 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 4, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.75 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.70 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Consolidated Edison has an Earnings ESP of 2.99%.ED is just one of a large group of Utilities stocks with a positive ESP figure. Sempra (SRE) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on May 4, 2023, Sempra holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.90 a share 29 days from its next quarterly update.Sempra's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.49% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ED and SRE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NYSE:LYB) Suggests It's 30% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-lyondellbasell-industries-n-120214036.html,1680782534,STORY,['LYB'],"[Key InsightsLyondellBasell Industries' estimated fair value is US$135 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$94.27 suggests LyondellBasell Industries is potentially 30% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 35% higher than LyondellBasell Industries' analyst price target of US$100Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries Is LyondellBasell Industries Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.62bUS$3.20bUS$3.20bUS$3.22bUS$3.26bUS$3.30bUS$3.35bUS$3.41bUS$3.47bUS$3.54bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x11Analyst x6Est @ 0.60%Est @ 1.04%Est @ 1.35%Est @ 1.57%Est @ 1.72%Est @ 1.82%Est @ 1.90% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$2.4kUS$2.7kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.1%) = US$54bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$54b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$23bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$44b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$94.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LyondellBasell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.129. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LyondellBasell IndustriesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

This move was made following a recent go-ahead given by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.A decree from Putin last year mandated that Sakhalin Energy Investment Co., the joint venture in charge of the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project, transfers its rights and responsibilities to a newly established state Russian company. Sakhalin Energy Investment, whose biggest stakeholder is Gazprom, had Shell and Japan’s Mitsui and Mitsubishi as minority shareholders.After Russia invaded Ukraine, Shell declared (in early 2022) that it would end its equity partnerships with Gazprom and related entities. These would include its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas facility, its 50% stake in the Salym Petroleum Development, and the Gydan energy venture.Following Putin's order in July 2022, the Russia government granted one month to the three minority foreign owners in Sakhalin-2 — Shell, Mitsui &amp; Co. and Mitsubishi — to claim their shares in the new company that would replace the existing project. While the Japan-based companies retained their stakes, Shell acknowledged that it was seeking ways to exit the project.In an attempt to purchase Shell's share of the Sakhalin-2 project, Novatek submitted an application with the government seeking permission to make the payment to Shell and allow the latter to receive the same in an overseas account. Per media reports, Putin approved the transfer of funds in order to minimize the risks for operating activities and export of hydrocarbons from the project.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Shell carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are CVR Energy CVI, Par Pacific Holdings Inc.

However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby making Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC,Valero Energy Corporation VLO and Phillips 66 PSX well-poised to gain.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices have behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data is per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Although oil price is currently favorable, the commodity’s pricing environment will remain volatile.Dividend Stocks to the RescueOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter investors from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. Handsome margins and throughput in all regions are aiding MPC. It pays out a quarterly dividend of 75 cents ($3.00 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.38% yield at the current stock price. (Check Marathon Petroleum’s dividend history here).Valero Energy Corporation: Constraint in worldwide refining capacity amid demand recovery is aiding Valero Energy. This is likely to boost the utilization of refinery capacity and, in turn, drive its bottom line. Valero Energy pays a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of $1.02 ($4.08 annualized) per share. (Check Valero Energy’s dividend history here).Phillips 66: Phillips 66 is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistic player with a presence in Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties businesses.

Also, oil and gas’s volatile price behavior critically influences the best energy stocks to buy.Despite the industry’s challenges, all three of the following energy stocks to buy have been achieving exceptional financial performance and delivering value to shareholders.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips This article examines how each company sets the stage for long-term growth while balancing financial performance and sustainability initiatives.XOMExxon Mobil$109.66CVXChevron$163.16VLOValero Energy$139.60ExxonMobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the best energy stocks to buy because it’s setting the stage for long-term growth. With its 2022 financial results showing robust cash flow and strong earnings, the company has made strategic investments in advanced projects that have driven production growth, leading to a total shareholder return of 87% that surpasses its peers.The company’s ambitious plan through 2027 aims to double earnings and cash flow growth potential compared to 2019, with a projected production of around 4.2 million oil-equivalent barrels daily.  The company commits to $17 billion in lower-emission initiatives, a 15% increase from the previous year’s plan. Exxon also has a share-repurchase plan of $50 billion through 2024 that will maximize shareholder value.With a strong balance sheet that provides financial flexibility, including the retirement of $7 billion of debt and a reduced net debt-to-capital ratio of 5%, ExxonMobil is well-positioned to continue delivering strong financial performance and sustainable growth for its shareholders.Story continuesChevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has been making significant progress in achieving its long-term strategic goals while delivering impressive financial performance. Despite cost inflation, this is one of the best energy stocks to buy because of the company’s commitment to capital discipline. The company has been paying down debt every quarter and ended the year with a 3% net debt ratio.Chevron delivers sharholdrer value by returning record annual cash through buybacks and ending the year with a yearly repurchase rate of $15 billion. This aligns with its annual dividend payout increases, positioning 2023 as the 36th consecutive year of dividend growth.Notably, Chevron’s long-term strategic focus centers on growing its upstream business, which is expected to achieve over a 3% compound annual growth rate for production by 2027. The company’s commitment to connecting natural gas resources to demand is clear in its extensive gas resource of over 175 net Trillion Cubic Feet. Chevron also aims to be a carbon-efficient energy supplier by lowering upstream carbon intensity towards its 2028 target. It focuses on reducing methane emissions and has tested 13 advanced detection technologies since 2016. Chevron is integrating renewables into its business, developing carbon capture value chains in the US Gulf Coast and Asia-Pacific regions, investing in Svante &amp; Carbon Clean and studying CO2 shipping.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) achieved exceptional financial performance in 2022, reporting a net income because of Valero stockholders of $11.5 billion for the year.

In addition, the company reduced its debt by $2.7 billion, bringing its aggregate debt reduction to $4.0 billion since H2-2021.Valero’s long-term strategic focus on advancing the future of energy with capital discipline, innovation and unmatched execution has been driving its growth and success. Valero is also making significant strides in reducing emissions through innovative low-carbon projects. As a result, the company’s comprehensive roadmap is aligned with its strategy, and it is exploring economic paths to reduce carbon intensity. Valero’s disciplined capital allocation and increased refinery availability make the company the lowest-cost producer, generating significant shareholder returns.

331,c88015c7-33b7-368d-bce6-d2499b637ad2,AAL,2023-04-06,New American Airlines Strategy Leaves Agencies With Dramatically Higher Airfares,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-airfare-pricing-gaps-185100814.html,1680720660,STORY,['AAL'],"[On April 3, American Airlines moved 40 percent of its tickets to New Distribution Capability-enabled channels, as well as its own channel. American AirlinesCorporate travel agencies are now seeing wide discrepancies in airfares after American Airlines overhauled its ticket distribution strategy.On April 3, the carrier moved 40 percent of its airfares to its “owned channel” (AA.com) as well as New Distribution Capability-enabled channels, and in the process stopping their sale through what it calls third-party legacy technology platforms (that use decades-old EDIFACT technology.) This includes EDIFACT technology and communications through global distribution systems, which most corporate travel agencies use.However, all three major global distribution systems (Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport) can also now provide access to American Airlines’ New Distribution Capability-enabled fares. Sabre was the last one to join the party, just about, on March 29.While in Europe several major airlines have already aggressively pushed their direct retailing strategies, American Airlines is the first carrier in the U.S. to move ahead, perhaps reflecting its acknowledgement of fewer pure business trips being flown.And back in September, American Airlines said that its lower fares would no longer be available through third-party legacy technology channels.Cheaper ItinerariesCorporate travel agency AmTrav said 35 percent of its itineraries had “lower fares in New Distribution Capability,” with average savings of $164 on those itineraries. For 13 percent of itineraries, the company was finding savings of more than $100, said CEO Jeff Klee in a LinkedIn post on WednesdayAnother agency, DCM Elite Travel Planners, based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has also seen big gaps.It cited flight AA2911 from New York to Chicago as an example. It said only one fare level, Main cabin, was accessible in the “legacy Sabre global distribution system.” Prices were roughly the same across all channels. But First and Flexible fare differences were “dramatic,” the agency said.First fares were $304 for the Sabre New Distribution Capability ticket, $305 through AA.com, and $483 through the EDIFACT Sabre channel.Story continuesMain Flexible fares were 103 percent more expensive in the standard Sabre global distribution system fare, compared to the Sabre New Distribution Capability ticket.First tickets were 59 percent more expensive, and First Flexible 39 percent more expensive.The lower fares that can be booked via AA.com or through New Distribution Capability are seen by some agencies as an incentive to encourage more bookings though the channel.“Whether American’s New Distribution Capability fares remain at a discount to EDIFACT-based fares or level out over time, the bigger opportunities with New Distribution Capability are personalization and a better traveler experience,” said Sarosh Waghmar, founder and CEO of Spotnana.“New Distribution Capability enables corporations to finally have a seat at the table where they can negotiate the custom bundles they want, and it supports a more seamless traveler experience when it comes to loyalty benefits, exchanges, cancellations, and disruptions.”Exchange QuestionsAnother issue being reported is that “old” unused tickets are unable to be converted to New Distribution Capability-compatible tickets. Businesses will often have many of these tickets sitting with their agencies.“Please give us a way to exchange EDIFACT for NDC. It is a lose-lose — customers are enraged by it which makes them furious at both American and the (travel management company)” AmTrav’s Klee wrote. “We all agree (I think) that it’s best if customers don’t even have to know about the change in plumbing. But the rules on exchanges make that impossible and it ends up reflecting badly on all of us.”After calling on American Airlines to postpone the changes, the American Society of Travel Advisors is now requesting its agency members to report if they “experience the negative effects of how American’s abrupt transition is impacting consumers (primarily) and your businesses (secondarily.)”“Smaller agencies are being disadvantaged because the systems that have normally been used for distribution are far less attractive because of pricing,” it said in a statement. “The primary concern is that corporate customers are being charged more because American Airlines is aggressively preferencing its direct channel.”The price discrepancy come as the UK’s Institute of Travel Management this week set up an emergency distribution taskforce.“Airfare distribution and New Distribution Capability are currently causing a major issue for many travel managers who are feeling battered by the challenges of airline retailing changes and the impact on managed travel programs,” it said.The institute added it was not based on buyers’ resistance to change, but the need for transparency around airlines’ motivation, investment roadmaps and partnerships“New Distribution Capability, airline distribution and modern retailing are causing our buyer members a major headache with some describing it as a ‘mess,’” the organization added.The institute also told Skift that some of its travel buyer members were looking at what bookings they can shift away from American Airlines, as the uncertainty is more challenging to deal.“We continue to track global distribution system progress in connecting to airline NDC APIs,” said SAP Concur, the most widely corporate booking and expense tool, in a statement on April 4. “Some still do not yet include important tools that business travelers and travel managers rely on including items such as interlining, code share, Known Traveler Number, the ability to exchange tickets, and key aspects of travel management servicing.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Despite a strong performance by major indices in March, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods especially with respect to woes related to inflation. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may lead to inflationary pressure aggravating and further economic uncertainty and market volatility.Given this uncertain scenario, it is anything but easy for individual investors to design a winning portfolio of stocks. But no one wants to see their hard-earned money go down the drain. Moreover, with multiple stocks flooding the market from every possible corner, at any point of time, it is next to impossible to design one’s portfolio with appropriate stocks in the absence of guidance from experts who are equipped with suitable market-related knowhow. The experts in the field of investing are the brokers.We believe that investors should keep track of broker-favorite stocks like CVR Energy CVI, American Airlines AAL, Bloomin’ Brands BLMN, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANF and Cleveland-Cliff CLF for attractive returns.Here’s Why Adhering to Broker Advice is AdvisableBrokers scrutinize publicly available financial documents and also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers recommend (buy, sell or hold) a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is prudent for investors to be guided by their direction of estimate revisions while deciding their course of action on a particular stock.The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons, including a favorable earnings performance, bullish guidance, product launch or an optimistic macro scenario.Story continuesWinning StrategyTo take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is taken into consideration. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. CVI's petroleum business includes a full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS.

American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bloomin’ Brands is a casual dining restaurant company with a portfolio of differentiated restaurant concepts such as Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar and Roy's.

But what does it mean to be a responsible company? More and more, individuals, institutions, and companies themselves are asking just that.Sometimes, that answer can be found in internal policies and priorities-a company deciding for itself what it means to be responsible. Insight might also come from outside acknowledgements and awards. In recent years, Principal® has focused on the former, and been recognized with the latter.An internal focus on responsibilityAs a business, Principal has a primary fiduciary responsibility to deliver returns to shareholders. Corporate governance also directs management to do what's good for customers and shareholders-and to do it with integrity; that's known as the Global Code of Conduct. ""Our strategy is grounded in our purpose,"" says Dan Houston, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Principal. ""We are united and inspired by our belief that everyone deserves access to financial security.""That can (and does) look like a lot of different things in practice, and impacts everything from sourcing to cybersecurity to hiring. For example, when it comes to hiring, integrity ensures a commitment to a diverse, inclusive workplace. Cybersecurity focuses on what Principal can do to protect customer data-training employees, for example.Our fiduciary responsibility also figures into guidelines for ESG-environmental, social, and governance. Often misunderstood, ESG is very much connected to a company's integrity as well as the ethical and social choices that support its values.Take the ""E"" in ESG: If a company dumps waste illegally, it may be more at risk, legally and financially; that, in turn, may impact its potential for growth. Investing in that company may pose a risk to our goal of maximizing returns for shareholders over time. ""S"" is found in our commitment to micro-finance that supports businesses owned by women and people of color, or in the dedicated time off provided to employees volunteering in their communities. ""G,"" in turn, refers not just to transparency in record keeping, but in our promise to build an inclusive leadership team.Story continues""When it comes to investing, there are a lot of factors that figure into an analysis,"" says Syd del Cid, senior ESG research analyst for Principal Asset ManagementSM. ""Those ESG factors are another way of thinking about how to mitigate risk and maximize return in a holistic way. It's additional information that's material to help make those investment choices.""External recognition of responsibilityAll sorts of awards aim to help people substantiate the responsibility claims that companies make. But are they reliable or even relevant? One of the more well-known is the Newsweek list of America's Most Responsible Companies.The Newsweek ranking reviews a whole assemblage of data: sustainability and corporate social responsibility reports, a survey asking U.S. citizens about perceptions, and financial report information, to name just a few. The final list of 500 gives a nod to the most responsible companies in the United States, representing 14 industries.In 2023, Principal made notable progress on this list: Not only did it move up from the 334th position in 2022 to 79th in 2023, but it also moved up 20 spots in its industry and was the highest-ranking investment company on the list.The Newsweek award is just one step along a continuous journey for Principal: Create more solutions for greater financial inclusion so more people can create their own version of financial security. That includes everything from external efforts like the 2022 launch of the Global Financial Inclusion Index to public promises like our 2020 commitment to double support of small businesses owned by women and people of color by 2025.""Helping our customers build a strong financial future while increasing financial inclusion within communities worldwide is important work we are deeply passionate about,"" Houston says.Learn more about our corporate responsibility commitments and progress.Integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is qualitative and subjective by nature.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Aflac in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -11.16% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.42 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.63%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.6%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.75%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11.72%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Aflac's payout ratio is 30%, which means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for AFL for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.59 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 4.88%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of stocks in high-interest rate periods and the performance of dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates. The continuous interest rate hikes have been a cause of investors’ worry for quite some time now. On March 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point, which was its ninth increase in a year. Moreover, Fed officials expect to hike interest rates to 5.1% by the end of the year in their effort to fight inflation, according to a report by New York Times.Rising interest rates can be challenging for nearly every sector, but some industries tend to perform better than others in this environment. For example, banks and other financial institutions typically benefit from growing interest rates since they charge higher rates on loans and earn more on their investments. Similarly, energy and utility sectors can be safe havens for investors during high-interest rate environments as they have predictable cash flows and solid dividend yields. According to a report by Charles Schwab, the energy and financial sectors returned 5% and 3%, respectively, relative to the broader market, in the year following the initial rate increase over the past five rate hike cycles from 1994 to 2015. Other sectors that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during this period include communication services, healthcare, information technology, and utilities.Though dividend stocks may experience some headwinds during periods of high-interest rates, the impact is not always straightforward and may depend on the individual stock’s financial position, dividend history, and dividend yields. Companies that have strong dividend histories and solid financial health often outperform their peers and the broader market when interest rates are high. In our previous article, we reported that high-dividend stocks surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 7 out of 10 rising interest rate periods from 1960 to 2017. We also highlighted the performance of companies with strong dividend growth histories between May 2005 and April 2015, when interest rates were high. The report revealed that the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered an annual average return of 12.3%, compared with an 8.5% return of the Dow Jones US Select Dividend Index. Some of the best dividend stocks include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Story continuesIt's important to be careful when investing in high-interest rate periods because higher rates can have a significant impact on various aspects of the economy and financial markets.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

The global economy is on the brink of a recession and the financial sector is already facing challenges. However, I believe that it’s a good time to accumulate some of the best commodity stocks.The first reason is that the demand for specific commodities will remain high in the coming decade. I am referring to the global focus on clean energy and decarbonisation.Another reason to be bullish is the possibility of a sharp recession. This might sound confusing. Let me elaborate. In a recession scenario, central banks will turn to expansionary policies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFurther, governments are likely to consider stimulus packages to boost economic activity. Both these scenarios will be positive for industrial commodities.Let’s therefore talk about three of the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 and for the long term.ALBAlbemarle Corporation$221.04RIORio Tinto$75.46FCXFreeport-McMoRan$40.91Albemarle Corporation (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comIt’s likely that the demand for lithium will continue to increase in the coming decade.Reports show that the lithium supply gap will be at least 1.1 million metric tons by 2035. Lithium is therefore one commodity that’s likely to remain in an uptrend.Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is possibly one of the best stocks for exposure to lithium. The company is on a high growth trajectory as it aggressively expands its lithium conversion capacity.With attractive price realization, the business is also a cash flow machine. For the current year, Albemarle has guided for operating cash flow of $2.2 billion.Albemarle ended 2022 with lithium conversion capacity of 200ktpa. The company expects to boost capacity to 550ktpa (mid-range of guidance) by 2027. Cash flows will be deployed for expansion besides value creation for investors through dividends.Overall, ALB stock is among the best commodity stocks to buy at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.5. I would not be surprised if the stock doubles in the next 24 months.Story continuesRio Tinto (RIO)the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylightSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is another undervalued commodity stock that seems poised for a reversal rally.At a forward P/E of 8.9 and a dividend yield of 7.36%, the stock is worth holding in the core portfolio.An important reason to like Rio Tinto is strong fundamentals. The company has an investment grade balance sheet and reported free cash flow of $9 billion in 2022. Healthy cash flows will ensure that dividends sustain.The balance sheet healthy gives the company scope to make big investments. Between 2023 and 2025, Rio Tinto expects to invest $27 billion. These investments will ensure steady growth and continued strength in cash flows.The iron ore segment is the cash flow driver. However, Rio Tinto is focused on asset decarbonisation. This includes investment in assets related to lithium, copper, among others.As an example, the company will be the largest source of lithium supply in Europe for at least the next 15 years.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) stock has been in an uptrend in the last six months. During this period, the stock has rallied by 47%. I expect the bullish momentum to sustain for copper play.Be it infrastructure development in emerging markets or focus on green energy, demand for copper is likely to remain high. I therefore consider FCX stock as one of the long-term portfolio stocks from the commodities space.Specific to Freeport, the company has deleveraged in the last few years and ended 2022 with a net debt position of $1.3 billion. The company has ample flexibility for exploration activities to boost its reserve base.It’s worth noting that Freeport expects annual copper sales at 4.2 billion lbs through 2025. Even with steady sales, higher price realization can boost free cash flows.From the perspective of shareholder value creation, Freeport returned $2.2 billion to investors in 2022 as compared to $800 million in 2021. Based on price realization, I expect dividend growth in the next few years.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.37, up 6.2% from the prior-year quarter.

""In some instances, meals are being replaced entirely by multiple snack-sized eating occasions. In effect, meals and snacks are merging, which is redefining their roles.""BofA's Spillane thinks snack brands are poised to take further market share away from traditional food items, setting the stage for good investment opportunities into the space.""We see broad agreement among corporates and investors that snacks offer growth and can create value,"" Spillane said, pointing to opportunities into category leaders like PepsiCo (PEP), Hershey (HSY), Campbell's Soup (CPB), Mondelez (MDLZ), and Utz (UTZ).This photograph taken in Paris on February 1, 2023, shows snacks displayed in a vending machine on a commuter train's platform. (Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images)Underscoring the shift, BofA estimates that the U.S. snacking industry — led by powerhouse names such as PepsiCo, via its Frito Lay business, and Hershey — clocked in a staggering $151 billion in sales last year.The total marks an 8% increase from 2021 and a 7% gain annually over the 2019-2022 peak COVID-19 pandemic period.Excluding ice cream (which is more of a sit-down snack), the snack food category's sales rose a solid 9% year on year in 2022 to $132 billion.Snacks accounted for 29% of total packaged food sales in 2022, Spillane estimated.""While taste, indulgence and convenience are important; consumers increasingly emphasize function (energy/protein/collagen), ingredients (simple/natural), ethnic/flavor exploration (""heat"" is in) into their snacks,"" Spillane said about the snack category's fundamental drivers.The snack revolution.Comments from top leaders in the snacking space to Yahoo Finance shed further light on the major shift in food consumption that looks to be underway post-pandemic.Story continues""Snacking is growing faster than food,"" Hostess Brands CEO Andy Callahan said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""And indulgent snacking is growing faster than snacking overall. So we're in a good position to continue to service consumers.""The Twinkie maker is focused on further leveraging its iconic sweet snack in even easier-to-eat form factors such as Bouncers, Callahan said.Meanwhile, cereal giant Kellogg (K) is so in on snacking that it's splitting up its legendary business to unlock value for shareholders. One business will house cereal brands such as Kellogg Cornflakes, while the other will house snack brands such as Pringles, Cheez-It, and Pop-Tarts.""We do believe that the snacking business is undervalued inside our portfolio today,"" Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).

348,bc64be89-5c8f-3e3d-b44b-66f4eb3c11d6,UNP,2023-04-06,PlayAGS and RH have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/playags-rh-highlighted-zacks-bull-121812752.html,1680697092,STORY,"['RH', 'AGS', 'NSC', '^GSPC', 'UNP']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 5, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares PlayAGS AGS as the Bull of the Day and RH RH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United Parcel Service, Inc. UPS and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:PlayAGS is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and it sports an A for Value and an A for Growth.  Despite so many calls for a recession, this name and several others in the gaming industry have been holding up rather well.  Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionPlayAGS, Inc. designs and supplies gaming products and services for the gaming industry in the United States and internationally. It operates through three segments: Electronic Gaming Machines (EGM), Table Products, and Interactive Games (Interactive). PlayAGS, Inc. was incorporated in 2005 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.For PlayAGS, I see three straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and that was all preceded by an earnings meet.  That is not that great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved around for URBN.This quarter has seen estimates improve from a loss of 11 cents to a loss of 8 cents.Next quarter moved from breakeven to a gain of 2 cents.The full fiscal year 2023 has increased from a loss of $0.13 to a gain of $0.01 over the last 30 days.Story continuesNext fiscal year sees estimates move from a loss of $0.02 to a gain of $0.19.Positive movement in earnings helped move this stock to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for AGS is mixed at these levels.  I see a forward earnings multiple of 1095x and that is super lofty, but a result of earnings being just barely positive. The price to book multiple of 5.6x is in line with other names in the industry.  Growth is solid at 16% and margins have seen a dramatic improvement.  If nothing else this stock is worth a deeper look.Bear of the Day:RH is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has seen earnings estimates slide lower in a big way recently.  This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionRH operates as a retailer in the home furnishings and operates under RH Galleries and RH brand names, as well as Waterworks showrooms throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. The company was formerly known as Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. and changed its name to RH in January 2017. RH was incorporated in 2011 and is headquartered in Corte Madera, California.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.In the case of RH, I see three beats and of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate and one earnings miss.  This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower.  For RH I see annual estimates moving lower of late.The current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $17.70 to $13.31 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $20.36 to $17.51.  That move lower is probably the biggest deciding factor for this stock to be a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions.  That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:These Railroad Stocks Look Attractive with Solid Dividend YieldsThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry continues to suffer from headwinds like raging inflation, higher interest rates, high fuel price and supply-chain disruptions. Even though oil price has declined (down 5.7% in the January-March period) due to recession fears, it remains high. Since fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, an uptick in fuel costs is not a welcome development. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 1.9% over the past three months against the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 8.4% appreciation and 5.6% rise of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like United Parcel Service, Inc. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks with Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.United Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $123.15 billion.UNP pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.30 ($5.20 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.61% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 46% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.02%. (Check United Pacific’s dividend history here).We are impressed with Union Pacific’s consistent efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company hiked its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP’s board of directors increased its quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.30 per share. Notably, Union Pacific has been paying dividends on its common stock for 123 consecutive years. In 2022, UNP paid dividends worth $3,159 million and repurchased shares worth $6,282 million. For 2023, management anticipates a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings).Union Pacific Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteNorfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $48.29 billion.NSC pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.35 ($5.40 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.59% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 36% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 11.95%. (Check Norfolk Southern’s dividend history here).Norfolk Southern Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Norfolk Southern Corporation QuoteWe are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In January 2023, the company's board announced a dividend hike of 9%, thereby raising its quarterly dividend payout from $1.24 per share to $1.35. During 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million.In 2021, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,028 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,390 million. Norfolk Southern's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In 2022, the free cash flow was $2,274 million.Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Toward Cisco's vision of an inclusive future for all, Cisco is partnering with Trickle Up to help them leverage technology to increase financial inclusion, independence, economic security, and resilience for women living in poverty.This blog was written by Nathalie Laidler-Kylander, President of Trickle Up. She brings over 30 years of multi-sector experience, including 18 years in international development. Nathalie holds a BS in Biochemistry from Imperial College at London University, an MBA from Harvard Business School, and a PhD from the Fletcher School at Tufts University.Trickle Up partners with women in extreme poverty to build economic opportunity and drive inclusion. Driven by their talents and dreams, equipped with new skills and assets, and supported through coaching and mentoring, women in our programs start micro-enterprises, build confidence, and save money for the future. They forge their own resilient pathways out of extreme poverty for themselves, their families, and their communities, breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.An estimated 650 million people live in extreme poverty in the world today. Many of them are women facing multiple forms of vulnerability, discrimination, and exclusion. But when women have livelihoods and resources, with the ability to make decisions over those resources, they invest in three things: nutrition, education, and health. Investing in women and their economic inclusion is one of the best ways to interrupt intergenerational poverty.The Importance of CoachingOur programs build on the Graduation Approach and offer participants an opportunity to join savings groups with women from their communities as well as access to training, coaching, and seed capital to build sustainable livelihoods. Individual and group coaching is one of the most important elements of our work. It enables us to accompany women as they build their confidence and resilience and create their own sustainable pathways out of poverty.Story continuesIn our experience, the best coaches are women who are from the same communities that we serve. These community coaches understand the context, experience, vulnerabilities, and challenges facing our participants, They are ideally positioned to share the technical content knowledge the community can't always access.That's where our tablet based Echb'eenink app (meaning ""to accompany"" in a local Mayan language) comes in. Pre-loaded with audio-visual content, including animated videos in local languages, it enables coaches to deliver important coaching modules to support participants as they build knowledge and confidence. New modules include coaching on gender-based violence, climate change, effective savings groups, and sexual and reproductive health.Last time I was in Guatemala, I remember how everyone in the community gathered round to see the animated educational videos on the tablet. The children were so excited to watch them with their mothers. And the content from the coaching app sparked important discussion between the community coach and participants.Trickle Up has benefited from Cisco Foundation's generous funding which has enabled us to add four new important coaching modules and to translate Echb'eenink into two additional indigenous languages in Mexico (Tzotzil and Mixtec). We are in the process of training 50 community coaches in Mexico and Guatemala on how to effectively use the coaching app and they in turn, will serve over 8,000 women. Our goal is to expand the use of Echb'eenink to all our coaches and participants worldwide, modifying and contextualizing modules and translating them into local and indigenous languages. Not only will this empower and build the capacity of our community coaches, but it also creates consistent and high-quality coaching content that is most relevant for our participants. As we partner with other organizations and scale our work, Echb'eenink will be a key tool helping us coach our partner's coaches. We will be able to leverage existing modules and content and adapt, contextualize, and translate them to meet the needs of the populations we serve.Addressing the Gender Digital DivideThe gap in access to digital technology between men and women is substantial. Globally, an estimated 63 percent of women have access to the internet compared to 69 percent of men. For rural women in extreme poverty, the population Trickle Up serves, less than 25 percent are connected. Echb'eenink is part of a portfolio of digital tools and strategies that Trickle Up is developing and implementing to address the lack of digital access and increase both the effectiveness and efficiency of our program delivery.In India, through our MPOWERED program, we train participants on digital skills and literacy, empowering community coaches and participants with smart phones and an app (the Package of Practice) that supports participants as they build knowledge and skills to enhance their livelihoods. Some of the women I met a few months ago have really leveraged their digital access and new abilities and have started ordering products to be delivered directly to them through digital marketplaces. They also love taking selfies and staying in touch with their friends and family through WhatsApp.In Kamwenge Uganda, Trickle Up has also been working to increase rural women's digital connectivity among refugee and host community women. With our partner organization AVSI Foundation Uganda, we piloted a digital literacy curriculum to teach vital digital skills. The curriculum includes a series of animated videos that cover all the basics of owning and caring for a smartphone, and how to leverage these devices to access an application focused on agriculture for the community's livelihoods. The animations are available in English and in the main languages used by local communities, namely Swahili, Kinyabwisha, and Runyakitara. Partners such as CARE Uganda have adopted our EQUALS curriculum which is available for open-source use here.Digitization for ScalingLeveraging digital tools and technology is increasingly important as we scale our work and build the capacity of other organizations and entities to adopt and adapt our programming. Our bold goal is to reach a total of 5 million people in extreme poverty by 2030 through 1 million women. We plan to do this by partnering with others, leveraging their infrastructure and resources, and providing them with the digital tools and technology like the Echn'eenink coaching app and the EQUALS digital literacy curriculum, to take this work to hundreds of thousands of women.I am so inspired by the smart, brave, resilient women that we have the privilege and honor of serving. I'm grateful for the ability to be, in a small way, part of providing the opportunity that enables them to unlock their potential and change the trajectory of their lives and the lives of their children, families, and communities. There is no other work I want to be doing and no better way to spend my days than investing in women who will change the world.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/747800/Trickle-Up-Leveraging-Technology-To-Build-Economic-Opportunity-and-Drive-Inclusion-for-Women-in-Extreme-Poverty]"
