You can skip our detailed analysis of the retirement situation in the US and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Dividend Stocks To Consider.', ""Over three and a half years after the onset of COVID-19, the US continues to have approximately 2 million more retirees than initially projected, marking one of the most notable and lasting shifts in the country's workforce, as reported by Bloomberg. This unexpected rise in retirements is evident in the significant difference between the number of retirees currently and what was forecasted by a Federal Reserve economic model. Though the gap has decreased from 2.8 million late last year, it remains higher than anticipated and has even increased from 1.7 million in June. Even with the increasing population of retirees in the US, numerous baby boomers express that they lack adequate funds to sustain their retirement lifestyle."", ""In the current market landscape, investing for retirement requires a thoughtful and diversified approach. With economic uncertainties, varying interest rates, and market volatility, choosing the right investment avenues becomes pivotal. Due to these challenges, many ordinary Americans are struggling to retire comfortably with their existing income. Bankrate's September survey revealed that approximately 56% of employed or temporarily unemployed Americans believe they're falling short in saving for retirement. Additionally, nearly a quarter of workers admitted to not making any contributions to their retirement accounts for at least a year. Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst, made the following comments in the report:"", '“Amid the tumultuous developments of the past several years, including a short but severe recession and a period of high and sustained inflation, a majority of Americans say they’re not where they need to be to achieve their retirement savings goals.”', 'Retirement investments ideally balance growth potential with stability. Typically, a diversified portfolio involving a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can be beneficial. In addition to this, dividend stocks can be a valuable component of a retirement portfolio due to their potential to generate consistent income. These stocks belong to companies that regularly distribute a portion of their earnings to shareholders. For retirees seeking a reliable income stream, dividend-paying stocks can be beneficial as they provide a source of passive income. Over recent years, dividend stocks have demonstrated considerable returns. Conover et al. (2016) conducted an empirical study spanning more than 50 years of US data, from 1962 to 2014, revealing that investing in dividend-paying stocks not only boosts returns but also notably mitigates risk across both value and growth portfolios, regardless of market capitalization. Their findings highlighted that the risk reduction was particularly pronounced when combining growth and value styles. The study also indicated that dividend-paying growth stocks tend to yield higher returns compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This research underscores the diversification advantages gained by incorporating an income-focused strategy into an investment portfolio.', 'Also read: Retirement Stock Portfolio: 12 Consumer Stocks To Consider', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

While the draw came as a pleasant surprise, its magnitude was well below the five-year average and the year-ago drop. Following the mixed inventory numbers, futures settled with a third consecutive loss week over week, overwhelmed by high production and predictions of insipid weather-related demand.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG."", 'Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Nov 17, in contrast to the guidance of a 6 Bcf addition, per a survey conducted by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The decrease compared with the five-year (2018-2022) average net shrinkage of 53 Bcf and last year’s decline of 60 Bcf for the reported week.The first draw of the winter heating season put total natural gas stocks at 3,826 Bcf, which is 251 Bcf (7%) above the 2022 level and 249 Bcf (7%) higher than the five-year average.', 'Natural gas prices trended downward last week despite the unexpected inventory decrease. Futures for December delivery ended Friday at $2.8550 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating some 3.6% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is the result of high supply and mild weather predictions.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With mild weather across major parts of the United States and forecasts for above-normal temperature in the longer term, usage of the commodity to generate electricity is expected to be tepid.As it is, natural gas is under pressure from near-record output, with current inventory levels well above the year-ago figure and the five-year average. The full restart of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas is also likely to contribute significantly toward the global supply picture. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by a blast in June last year and has been functioning only partially since its resumption in February. \xa0Having said all of that, there are signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down around 25% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, recently reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine.', 'Following last week’s decrease, the natural gas market is down more than 36% so far this year. Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for holding on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades. About 68% of the Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) company’s total output is natural gas.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Range Resources beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 33.6%. Valued at around $8.1 billion, RRC has gained 18.1% in a year.Coterra Energy: It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. The Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.8%. Valued at around $20.1 billion, CTRA has edged down 1.4% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 602.5% for the current year.

With this rise in connectivity, the need for advanced security measures at the chip level, protecting both firmware and data, is critical. To defend against current and ever-expanding security threats, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) has launched the PIC18-Q24 Family of Microcontrollers (MCUs).', 'To counter the threat of maliciously reprogramming a device in an embedded system, PIC18-Q24 MCUs introduce the Programming and Debugging Interface Disable (PDID) feature. When enabled, this enhanced code protection feature is designed to lock out access to the programming/debugging interface and block unauthorized attempts to read, modify or erase firmware.', '“System security is only as strong as its weakest link. Any programmable component can be vulnerable, and it is essential to implement enhanced protection features to prevent potential hacks,” said Greg Robinson, corporate vice president of Microchip’s 8-bit MCU business unit. “The PIC18-Q24 family of MCUs from Microchip are designed with advanced security in the forefront, to help customers combat threats at the system’s foundation.”', 'Because many secure systems often connect and communicate with a wide variety of sensors, memory chips and processors, the PIC18-Q24 MCUs feature Multi-Voltage I/O (MVIO). This feature eliminates the need for external level shifters and allows the MCUs to interface with digital inputs or outputs at different operating voltages. In addition to reducing board complexity and Bill of Material (BOM) cost, MVIO makes PIC18-Q24 MCUs especially well-suited as system management processors, performing monitoring and telemetry for a larger processor. These seemingly routine tasks are typically most vulnerable to potential hackers as they try to gain access to embedded systems.', 'The PIC18-Q24 family is also enabled with the option to have an immutable bootloader for applications that want a secure way to upgrade firmware.

Investors in these deals include lightly-regulated entities like hedge funds, shifting risk to the shadow banking sector. That raises the prospect that regulators will have less visibility and understanding of the dangers that lurk in the financial system. The ability to shed the risk could also encourage banks to get more aggressive on lending, leading to problems later.', '""If a bank didn\'t manage interest rate risk well, does it appreciate potential risks associated with these transactions?"" said Jill Cetina, associate managing director at Moody’s. ""It raises the need for better and more fulsome disclosure in banks\' regulatory filings.""', 'Over the last few months, banks including JPMorgan Chase , Merchants Bank of Indiana and US Bancorp, have sold the risk of losses on billions of dollars of loans for cars, multi-family homes, private funds, junk-rated companies, commercial equipment and consumers, these industry sources said.', ""Jon-Claude Zucconi, head of tactical situations at Apollo's ATLAS SP Partners, which structures such deals, said many U.S. banks are setting up programs to issue credit linked notes for the first time."", 'He expects U.S. banks to sell the risk on nearly $100 billion of assets over the next 12 months, freeing up nearly $15 billion of equity capital.

""If we see risks arising in those transactions, then we would limit their use for capital mitigation.""', 'SIGNIFICANT INCREASE', 'The surge in interest in these transactions comes after regulators, led by Barr, proposed capital requirements earlier this year that were tougher than what banks had hoped.', 'Smaller banks not affected by the proposal have also been looking at these deals as a way to free up capital as conditions tightened after the regional banking crisis.', '""Banks are spending a lot of time on their loan books and figuring out how to optimize what they have,"" said Missy Dolski, global head of capital markets at Varde Partners, which invests in such transactions.', 'Some banks have sold loan portfolios, businesses and cut down their lending, which were not optimal strategies because it reduces their market share and competitiveness, said Sam Graziano, managing director at advisory firm Chatham Financial.', 'Some considered raising capital by selling shares and preferred equity but it was expensive due to low stock valuations and high interest rates, Graziano said.', 'Credit risk transfer is another tool for them to pursue after the Fed’s clarification on what is allowed, said Cory Wishengrad, head of fixed income at Guggenheim Securities.', ""Jed Miller, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, said often these transactions were structured so that proceeds must be retained by the bank on deposit for the life of the trade.

One of the earlier ones this year was done by Merchants Bank, an Indiana-based lender with $16 billion in assets. The details of its structure shed light on how these deals work.', ""Merchants priced a $158.14 million credit-linked note on March 24, providing credit protection on some commercial mortgages, including loans to nursing and assisted-living facilities, the deal's terms show. The transaction freed up Merchant's capital, allowing it to use it to make new loans."", 'Through the trade, the bank would absorb the first 1% of losses on the portfolio, while the next 14% would be absorbed by investors, according to the term sheet. That means Merchants sold the riskiest tranche of the loan portfolio, maximizing the capital relief it could get on it.', 'The investors deposited cash in a collateral account as protection to Merchants Bank, the term sheet shows.', 'Merchants did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Then last month, JPMorgan did one of the largest trades of this kind. It placed synthetic credit linked notes for $2.5 billion with investors, three sources said. They referenced a pool of mortgages and loans totaling about $20 billion, the sources said.', 'Deborah Staudinger, banking and loan finance partner at Hogan Lovells, said banks are also considering transactions to lower risk on a single loan or a portfolio by buying insurance.', 'The deals, which are yet to happen, can be secured by cash or other collateral posted by one or more insurers.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.', ""Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +11.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 10.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.23 per share, indicating a change of -6.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.58 points to a change of -12.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.60 indicates a change of +18.4% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Revenue Growth Forecast', ""While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.1 billion and $56.59 billion estimates indicate +0.8% and +4.6% changes, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Morgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.27 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.2%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $1.53 a year ago.', 'Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.48%. The EPS surprise was +8.66%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Morgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

The Financial Times reported that even though Englander had effectively given up sole control over the firm, it was still not immediately clear who was in charge. This is because, per the publication, Englander had set up the hierarchy of the fund in such a manner as to remove the need for a central authority, instead relying on the combined expertise of several top executives.\xa0', 'The report is a testament to the incredible leadership of Israel Englander, who started his hedge fund with only $35 million in capital in 1989. Englander uses a multi-manager platform at his investment firm to reward employees. For example, managers who perform well are given more capital to spend, while those that lag behind are shown the doors. Englader, whose personal net worth is over $11 billion, has a background as a floor broker, trader, and specialist on the American Stock Exchange.', 'Our Methodology', 'These were picked from the investment portfolio of Millennium Management at the end of the third quarter of 2023.

Here is what the fund said:', '“We added to our position in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties.

T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.', 'This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.', 'Given the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.', 'We have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend.

Mixed second calendar quarter financial results, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations, coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year, pressured shares. Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On top of these trends in the core business, Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality, search, financial services, and streaming media content.

Investors’ concerns regarding Tesla in 2022 continue to dissipate, and the company’s business has continued to grow materially, although at below peak margins. Tesla’s deliveries in China are recovering. The company’s newest factory in Texas has ramped production and should contribute to improved domestic sales and margins. U.S. government policies have lowered the cost to own Tesla vehicles, while also reducing the company’s battery production expenses.', 'We continue to believe that Tesla is only scratching the surface of its potential. We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers. EV adoption is at a tipping point.

Investors often favor food stocks due to their perceived stability and resilience, even during economic downturns. Food is a fundamental necessity, which means that demand for food products tends to remain relatively consistent regardless of market conditions. This consistency in demand offers a level of stability to food companies, making their stocks attractive to investors seeking safe havens or dependable returns. Additionally, food stocks are seen as defensive investments, meaning they can withstand economic fluctuations as people continue to purchase food even during tough times.', ""Don't Miss: Best Food Stocks to Buy"", ""Despite the volatile nature of the market throughout 2022, marked by an S&P 500 decline of nearly 18%, food stocks remained remarkably stable. The leading manufacturers in the sector, including General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG) demonstrated resilience by averaging a 22% return, factoring in dividends. While the broader market experienced significant fluctuations, these key players within the food industry showcased a steadiness that not only weathered the market storm but also yielded notable returns for investors, highlighting the sector's reliability even during uncertain economic times."", 'However, the landscape for food stocks shifted notably this year, as many experienced a significant downturn. The S&P Food and Beverage Select Industry, which tracks the performance of stocks belonging to various food subindustries, is down by 4.57% this year so far, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which gained 19.09% year-to-date. That said, Wedbush analysts believe that restaurant stocks already reflect a recession, which they think is a chance for investors to buy. They mentioned that these stocks are selling at lower prices, similar to what you might see in worse economic times, making it a good opportunity to invest in them. The typical full-service restaurant stock is being traded at roughly 13.8 times its expected earnings for 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500 is valued at around 18 times earnings. The analysts pointed out that such a difference in value has occurred only three times in the last 15 years.', 'The US is a market leader in the packaged food sector, holding a significant market share of 18.6% in 2023, according to Future Market Insight’s report.

His father came home that day ordering his mother to stop caring for Uno and make him food instead, according to a 2020 biography. If the child died, they could always have more, Uno’s father told her.', 'After years of refusing to be involved in the business, Uno only agreed to take it over when his dad was on his death bed — and he felt he had no choice.', '“I didn’t want to be like my father,” Uno was quoted as saying in the Japanese-language biography, whose title translates as The Bravery of an Entrepreneur.', '“I had a strong desire to be a completely different entrepreneur,” he added in an interview in Tokyo.', 'A quarter of a century later, Usen-Next Holdings Co. operates a streaming service with more than 4 million subscribers and dozens of other businesses ranging from broadband internet to services for shops. Usen-Next’s stock has surged this year on record earnings, pushing Uno’s wealth to more than $1 billion at the end of last week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock dropped on Monday, and he’s now worth $989 million, according to the wealth gauge.', 'Uno’s agreement to take command of the family business is far from the norm in Japan, where some 60% of companies surveyed by Teikoku Databank Ltd. have yet to find a successor. A record 487 small firms closed in the fiscal year ended March because of this, the market researcher said.', 'The company’s transformation under him is an example of a phenomenon pointed out by academics. A child is about 60% more likely to be an entrepreneur if a parent was, according to a paper published in 2014.', 'Yet as Uno tells it, his father, Mototada, wasn’t always a good example. Mototada was born into a family of Chinese immigrants who had moved to Japan before World War II. He established Osaka Usen Broadcasting in 1961, when Japan’s economy was booming. It sent background music by coaxial cable to shops, restaurants and other businesses. Usen is the Japanese word for cable.', 'Over four decades, Mototada steadily developed the company. By the time he died of cancer in 1998, Usen had a roughly 70% share of Japan’s cable music market.', 'But there was a catch. Usen had used millions of government-owned telephone poles for his cables without permission, Uno explained in the biography. It was another reason why Uno didn’t want the role.', 'Uno was also doing his own thing. He had set up a job agency called Intelligence Co. with three friends in Tokyo and was planning to take it public.', 'His mother pleaded with him to take over Usen. Even though Uno wasn’t the eldest son, he was his father’s preferred successor. Eventually, he relented and returned to Osaka, leaving his co-founders to run his firm.', '“A part of me wanted to take on the challenge,” Uno said at Usen-Next’s headquarters in the upscale Meguro area of Tokyo. With its glass-walled offices and sofas, it looks more like a modern startup than a 62-year-old firm.', 'After Uno took over, the company’s survival hinged on bringing its use of the telephone poles within the law. But his father had soured relations with the government by ignoring its requests and warnings for years.', 'When Uno tried to make amends after almost three decades, officials didn’t want to know. They hung up when he called. “Why don’t you come back in a hundred years?” one told him, according to the biography.', 'Eventually, the government and Usen agreed on a plan to resolve the issue. Usen staff had to photograph and register cables connected to more than 7 million telephone poles. Even the most loyal employees bristled. At one point, a bloody straw doll was delivered to Uno’s doorstep as a death threat. But after a year, the job was done. Not long later, in 2001, Usen listed on the Osaka exchange.', 'Usen fell into difficulties again during the global financial crisis. As earnings worsened, it became unable to repay its debt. Under pressure from banks to offload loss-making operations, Uno had to sell the video-streaming service. In an unusual twist, he sold it to himself, paying for it with his own money. He was convinced it would later become a growth engine. Years later, in 2014, he listed the company, called U-Next, in Tokyo. Then in 2017, U-Next bought the legacy business, Usen.', 'Today, the Usen-Next group consists of some 25 companies. The cables now also provide broadband internet. The video-streaming business surged in popularity during the pandemic when people were stuck at home. It added 1.2 million new users last fiscal year, a 43% increase from the year before. It’s No. 2 in Japan after Netflix, according to research firm GEM Partners.', 'For Daisuke Aiba, an analyst at Tokyo-based brokerage Iwai Cosmo Securities Co., Usen-Next may be able to overtake the US giant in Japan because it offers a wider array of content tailored to Japanese subscribers.', '“He built it into a business fit for a new era,” Aiba said. “He’s someone who knows how to push ahead with a plan.”', 'A representative for Netflix declined to comment.', 'Despite the growth in streaming, Usen-Next’s store-services business, which includes background music and payment terminals, still contributes the most to profit. Store services accounted for 46% of operating profit in the fiscal year ended August, compared with 29% for content distribution.', 'Usen-Next made ¥21.6 billion ($145 million) in operating profit on ¥276 billion in sales in the fiscal year ended August, both records. The company’s shares are up 66% this year, giving it a market value of about $1.4 billion. All six analysts covering Usen-Next recommend buying the stock.', 'But the business relies heavily on the 1.1 million distribution contracts that it has with stores. With the government’s decision last year to stop taking applications from retail businesses for support to help them through the pandemic, an increasing number of them are forecast to shut down.', '“Any bankruptcies of these stores such as restaurants is worrisome because that’s the heart of the business,” said Hiroshi Namioka, chief strategist at T&D Asset Management Co., a unit of Japanese insurer T&D Holdings Inc.', 'Still, Uno says he doesn’t see any major threats to the business. And after 25 years in the job, 15 longer than his father asked for, he has no plans to step down. Uno says he now has deep respect for his father, because of his drive.', '“Life has been a repetition of successes and failures,” he said when asked how he feels about his wealth. “At times people told me I’m great. Other times, I was told I should be dead. It doesn’t quite feel like a life of success.”', '--With assistance from Shintaro Inkyo and Sohee Kim.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'No Laws Protect People From Deepfake Porn.

If you want to skip our analysis of different investment metrics and the latest stock market news, then take a look at the 5 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns. ', ""There are several criteria that an investor can use to make an investing decision on the stock market. Broadly speaking, these can be divided into a fundamentals based approach and a technical approach. On the fundamental front, investors analyze a firm's balance sheet, its income statement, and the cash flow statements to see whether there's meat to a firm's evaluation. A technical investor on the other hand looks at share price movements and trends to see whether broader market sentiment can push a stock higher."", ""When analyzing a stock's fundamentals, one of the most common approaches is to look at the price to earnings ratio. As the title suggests, the P/E ratio divides the firm's share price with its earnings per share. For this purpose, three kinds of EPS can be used. These can be the earnings during the latest fiscal quarter, the trailing twelve month earnings, and forward earnings derived through analysis. The P/E ratio is then used to classify a stock as a growth or a value stock. A growth stock is one that has a high P/E ratio which indicates that investors are confident about paying a higher price today relative to the earnings as they expect that growth will push the earnings higher in the future."", ""Naturally, this makes growth stocks quite attractive since they carry the potential to deliver massive returns. As an illustration, consider the shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD's P/E ratio just a couple of years back was in the triple digits. This was when the firm had not expanded its chip production, so it was making little money. However, investors were confident that it could grow its market share in the future through successful product design and manufacturing scaling and valued it accordingly. These expectations materialized in the future (i.e. today) since AMD's stock is up by 474% over the past five years."", 'However, while high growth stocks are attractive and their performance is tightly linked to their fundamentals, a key factor to remember when considering them for an investment decision is the broader stock market climate. Shifts in the economy or the macroeconomic environment have the potential to either hammer growth stocks or push them to new highs. The latter was the case in 2022 as the fundamental dynamics that drove the stock market for the past decade rapidly shifted in the form of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Higher rates make it difficult for consumers to make pricey technology purchases, raise the stakes for hedge funds to invest in the stock market, and increase the working capital costs of running a business. All three drag down the stock market since they impact corporate performance.', 'With 2023 now coming to a close, this dynamic appears to be shifting. For instance, consider a new report by the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which maps out money flows into equity funds. This report shows that during the four trading sessions that ended on November 21, 2023, a net of $16.5 billion flew into the funds. Since October 9th, a whopping $40 billion has been piled into equities, which is perhaps the biggest indicator of the changing sentiment around stocks. This data is backed by more figures from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). It reveals that for the week ending on November 2023, U.S. equity funds received $6.27 billion. Sector wise, it was technology that shone, with $2.29 billion of net inflows during the time period. This is interesting since technology is a high growth sector with high P/E ratios. On the flip side, the relatively stable and value based utilities and healthcare sectors saw $382 million and $339 million in outflows - lending more credence to the fact that perhaps the era of growth investing is back.', 'There is more optimism in the stock market as well. As of Monday, November 20th, 55% of the S&P 500, which is up by 8% in November, was trading above its 200 day moving average. This is a positive development that indicates that a broader set of stocks (as opposed to the tech fueled rally in H1 2023) are on an upward trend. In technical trading, the 200 day moving average is a crucial resistance point that is often seen as a barrier to longer term share out performance.', 'So, as the stock market clouds start to clear, we thought to take a look at the best stocks to buy for high returns.

Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Newmont Corp's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NEM.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', ""Newmont is the world's largest gold miner.

Its portfolio includes 17 wholly or majority-owned mines and interests in two joint ventures in the Americas, Africa, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. The company is expected to produce roughly 7.3 million ounces of gold in 2023 pro forma for Newcrest on an annualized basis.

Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', 'As of today, Newmont Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.57% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.17%. This suggests an expectation of decreased dividend payments over the next 12 months.', ""Over the past three years, Newmont Corp's annual dividend growth rate was 57.80%.

The payout ratio of 0.00, indicating no earnings or no dividend payout, raises questions about the current profitability and the ability to maintain dividends in the near term. However, the company's long-standing history of dividend payments may provide some reassurance to investors. As the mining giant integrates its recent acquisition of Newcrest, the future growth and dividend prospects of Newmont Corp may hinge on how effectively it leverages its expanded asset base and navigates the volatile commodities market. Value investors should consider all these factors in their analysis. Will Newmont's dividends continue to glitter, or will they need to dig deeper to sustain their payout?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global defense industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Most Powerful Country Leaders In The World in 2023.', ""2023 has largely been characterized by a litany of geopolitical flashpoints and conflicts, with the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe seeing an unprecedented amount of turbulence. These conflicts arise within the backdrop of a larger Sino-American rivalry which proves to be a consistent flashpoint in today's geopolitical landscape, giving credence to some of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023. According to a report by PwC, this has caused global defense expenditure to skyrocket in recent years, with initial projections rising up to $2 trillion by 2026, growing at an average year-on-year of 1.1%. The United States represents more than 60% of the total market, with the rest coming from other powers around the world. These large, stable markets sustain persistent and considerable demand driven by constant geopolitical and security challenges."", ""The primary trend which is likely to seep into 2024 and affect the growth of the global defense industry is the increasing pressure exerted by supply chain challenges on the U.S. defense industrial base. A result of Western support for Ukraine amidst Russia-Ukraine conflict, munitions are being spent on the Ukrainian front at rates far exceeding normal lean-production delivery models exercised by the industry in recent years. According to a report by the Financial Times, Ukraine's crusade against Putin, who is one of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, is consuming armament at an unprecedented frequency. The country has been firing more than 4500 artillery rounds a day. This massive shift to a war footing has exacerbated a massive supply chain challenge as defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) race to increase the rate of production to refresh national stockpiles as well as maintain supplies to the country.\xa0"", ""Another trend likely to impact the global defense industry in 2024 is the growing risk of cyber attacks seen in recent years. Cybersecurity is an integral element of a modern state's military capabilities. Threats may range from adversaries seeking to steal or disrupt the development of equipment, to seizing control of hostile drones and other susceptible systems. Militaries around the world are diverting increased investments in ramping up their cybersecurity apparatus in order to ensure future and continuous success on the physical and digital battlefield. According to a market research report by Precedence Research, the global cybersecurity market is currently valued at more than $210.5 billion and is projected to reach $691.6 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.58% during the forecast period 2022-2032. To read more on trends affecting the global aerospace and defense industry in 2024, check out our coverage of the 15 Biggest Gun Companies in the World."", 'According to a report by McKinsey, the larger aerospace and defense industry is facing extreme competition with respect to securing adequate labor. This competition mainly springs from other more lucrative industries like the technology and healthcare industry which offer more attractive salaries and benefits. Although the technology industry has slowed down hiring considerably in the face of constant macroeconomic pressure, the report opines that the race to secure the best talent will only continue to garner more traction and momentum, especially in high-demand roles where shortage of adequate labor is more pronounced. One of the primary reasons why defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are struggling to attract competent talent is due to a massive demographic shift within global urban populations, which McKinsey terms a transition from a ""gray"" to ""green"" workforce. Much of the older workforce is nearing retirement and a younger demographic is swiftly moving into the labor stream. This shift gives rise to other different factors at play, such as a shift in employee preferences, expectations, and work conditions. Moreover, the Great Resignation is another powerful factor shaping employment prospects within the larger A&D industry, with surveys indicating that more than 46 percent of employees are looking to switch employment within the next six months. This is exacerbated by the fact that younger employees are twice as likely to switch jobs compared to their older counterparts. As a result of these trends, defense companies are seeing younger talent seep through the cracks and talent replacement rates plunge dramatically. Furthermore, as the older generation approaches retirement, younger people are switching jobs much more frequently and are lacking the essential skills needed to thrive in the defense business.', 'In order to overcome this labor crisis, companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), which cater to some of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, can focus on sourcing talent from a pool that numerous employers tend to ignore by making use of the 70 million workers in the US classified as skilled through alternative routes (STARs). This segment of the workforce often has the skills needed in higher-wage jobs but are conventionally ignored. Hence, hiring should be more geared towards community colleges, military service, and on-the-job learning. Secondly, defense companies must shift lenses with respect to the role of manager as someone who drives purpose and leads greener teams of employees which may exhibit a greater turnover rate. Furthermore, many companies are investing in creating nonlinear career paths, non-promotion based advancement mechanisms, and different forms of recognizing achievement. This can aid companies in better catering to an increasing demand for more visible and faster career progression and career optionality. McKinsey also highlights the need for instituting mechanisms which enable more frequent evaluation and discourse around diversity, equity and inclusion practices, coupled with the creation of employee resource groups which can better equip defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in satisfying the requirements of the greener cohort. According to research, employees in more efficient ERGs respond with higher positive inclusion score relative to employees in non-functional or ineffective ERGs. Since a reliable flow of labor is one of the essential preconditions to value creation, defense companies are diverting greater investments in models which have a proven track record of employee retention success. One of these models is the construction of a localized ""talent win room"", which accumulates resources from different organizations to curate a more efficient and seamless employee value proposition and onboarding process.\xa0', ""Don't Miss: Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World"", 'Photo by rob walsh on Unsplash ', ""To compile our list of the 20 most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, we decided to undertake a consensus based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research which studied individual and state power (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We then shortlisted more than 50 leaders which appeared most frequently during our research. Since power is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the power of each leader; the criteria is premised on the country's military strength and the leader's role in maintaining and enhancing it (20 points), the economic policies implemented by the leader (15 points), and the global influence of the leader in the geopolitical arena (10 points). We then proceeded to award each leader a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 20 leaders which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest.

Nuclear reactors, which bombard radioactive fuel such as uranium or plutonium with neutrons to kick start a chain reaction, are some of the biggest and most complex machines known to humankind. Now, a newer kind of reactor, called a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) is creating traction. As their name might suggest, these reactors are smaller than their older peers, which enables the industry to build them faster and cheaper. One such SMR reactor is being built by a General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) subsidiary GE-Hitachi. The BWRX-300 nuclear reactor aims to deliver 24/7 carbon free electrical power, with a power generation capacity of up to 300 megawatts. For comparison, an average solar panel can produce roughly 300 kilowatts of power on average, so you'd need one thousand solar panels to produce a similar amount of power as the BWRX-300 - with the added caveat of no baseload support in case of poor weather."", 'Yet, despite their numerous advantages, nuclear energy is often one of the most controversial topics simply due to the massive dangers involved in operating the reactors and disposing of their spent radioactive fuel.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after investigating NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.

The company has consistently earned 6.6% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 67% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital."", ""In conclusion, NextEra Energy has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 41% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high."", ""Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for NextEra Energy   (of which 1 is concerning!) that you should know about."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the food industry and its previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Food Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'The food sector in the US is diverse and expansive, encompassing various aspects such as agriculture, food production, distribution, and consumption. Investors often favor food stocks due to their perceived stability and resilience, even during economic downturns. Food is a fundamental necessity, which means that demand for food products tends to remain relatively consistent regardless of market conditions. This consistency in demand offers a level of stability to food companies, making their stocks attractive to investors seeking safe havens or dependable returns. Additionally, food stocks are seen as defensive investments, meaning they can withstand economic fluctuations as people continue to purchase food even during tough times.', ""Don't Miss: Best Food Stocks to Buy"", ""Despite the volatile nature of the market throughout 2022, marked by an S&P 500 decline of nearly 18%, food stocks remained remarkably stable. The leading manufacturers in the sector, including General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG) demonstrated resilience by averaging a 22% return, factoring in dividends. While the broader market experienced significant fluctuations, these key players within the food industry showcased a steadiness that not only weathered the market storm but also yielded notable returns for investors, highlighting the sector's reliability even during uncertain economic times."", 'However, the landscape for food stocks shifted notably this year, as many experienced a significant downturn. The S&P Food and Beverage Select Industry, which tracks the performance of stocks belonging to various food subindustries, is down by 4.57% this year so far, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which gained 19.09% year-to-date. That said, Wedbush analysts believe that restaurant stocks already reflect a recession, which they think is a chance for investors to buy. They mentioned that these stocks are selling at lower prices, similar to what you might see in worse economic times, making it a good opportunity to invest in them. The typical full-service restaurant stock is being traded at roughly 13.8 times its expected earnings for 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500 is valued at around 18 times earnings. The analysts pointed out that such a difference in value has occurred only three times in the last 15 years.', 'The US is a market leader in the packaged food sector, holding a significant market share of 18.6% in 2023, according to Future Market Insight’s report. This industry has been influenced by trends associated with mindful eating, which gained immense importance following the pandemic. Presently, American consumers are prioritizing food products that align with their diverse health and sustainability goals, while also considering traditional objectives such as weight management when making their food choices.', ""US packaged food companies are gearing up for changes in their brand lineup as their pandemic success slows down and the effects of price increases begin to ease off. There's been an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the food industry during the first part of this year. While the total worth of deals in the US food and beverage sector decreased by nearly 3% to around $10.39 billion this year, the number of deals rose by 17.5% to 248 as of September 1, according to LSEG data. This surge in deal volumes highlights the food industry as a standout area for business deals."", 'As mentioned above, food stocks are often considered defensive investments due to the consistent demand for food regardless of economic conditions. Among these, companies in the food sector that pay dividends hold a particular appeal for investors. These dividend-paying food companies are favored for their stability and ability to generate regular income through dividends, which can be especially attractive in uncertain market environments.

That would be 5.4% higher than last year.', 'Adobe estimates Cyber Monday spending will increase by 6.1% to $12 billion.', 'Those figures are not adjusted for inflation. However, online prices have been falling, which means the increase in spending isn’t simply the result of increased prices and inflation – there is real demand growth.', 'Adobe said that if online deflation was factored in, growth in consumer spending would be “even stronger.”', 'Retailers are relying on promotions, even more than usual, to get shoppers to open their wallets.', 'Adobe Analytics expects discounts of up to 35% off toys this holiday season and deep discounts for electronics (up to 30%), sporting goods (up to 24%), apparel (up to 25%) and appliances (up to 20%).', 'JCPenney has slashed prices on some items so much that they’re selling for pre-Covid prices. The department store told CNN on Monday it is offering 2019 prices on gifts including men’s hoodies, women’s boots, coats and some kitchen products.', 'The early results suggest the holiday shopping season is off to a positive start, aided in part by lower gas prices.', 'Americans spent $9.8 billion online shopping on Black Friday, up 7.5% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics.', 'Shoppers gravitated toward electronics, including smart watches (sales were up 577% compared with October 2023), TVs (+484%), audio equipment (+376%), Adobe said.', 'Another popular measure of holiday spending, Mastercard SpendingPulse, found e-commerce sales jumped by an even stronger 8.5% year-over-year on Black Friday.', 'However, in-store sales increased by just 1.1%, according to SpendingPulse. Mastercard noted that there were a number of sporting events on Friday, including the NFL’s first-ever Black Friday game, making online shopping an appealing option for sports fans.', '“Consumers do have a lot of choice right now. They’re looking for the best deal and that best deal oftentimes… comes from your c ouch right after the Thanksgiving meal,” said Mastercard’s Meyer.', 'That’s not to say brick-and-mortar stores are empty.', 'Black Friday store traffic increased 4.6% year-over-year, according to Sensormatic data cited by Bank of America. Sensormatic noted this was the “most significant Black Friday increase we’ve seen in recent memory,” though traffic is still 20% lower than 2019 levels.', 'In another sign of sturdy consumer spending, Americans continue to travel aggressively.', 'Sunday marked the busiest day at US airports on record, according to federal data. The Transportation Security Administration screened more than 2.9 million passengers at checkpoints across the country, up 10% from the equivalent day last year.', 'The resilience of consumer spending is impressive, given countless obstacles.', 'Inflation is cooling, but only after three years of a very high cost of living, and with many companies reluctant to lower prices back down again. Credit card rates are also at record highs as the Federal Reserve keeps up interest rates.', 'At least some consumers are coming under growing financial pressure.', 'More Americans are yanking money from their 401(k) plans to pay the bills. Credit card balances have increased to a record $1.1 trillion and the share of households newly delinquent on credit cards is at the highest level in a dozen years. Some Americans are even falling behind on their auto loans.', 'Yet the historic jobs boom continues.

That’s down 63 cents from the peak in September and marks 60 consecutive days of falling gas prices. In fact, this marked the cheapest Thanksgiving Day gas price since 2020, when Covid prevented many people from hitting the road.', 'Meyer said the early holiday shopping strength gives her confidence about the outlook for 2024. The Mastercard economist said the economy seems to be finding a “new equilibrium” after growing too rapidly in the wake of Covid.', '“We are going to be settling into a more moderate growth trajectory from here,” Meyer said. “But I do think the US economy has room left to grow.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

If you want to skip our analysis of different investment metrics and the latest stock market news, then take a look at the 5 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns. ', ""There are several criteria that an investor can use to make an investing decision on the stock market. Broadly speaking, these can be divided into a fundamentals based approach and a technical approach. On the fundamental front, investors analyze a firm's balance sheet, its income statement, and the cash flow statements to see whether there's meat to a firm's evaluation. A technical investor on the other hand looks at share price movements and trends to see whether broader market sentiment can push a stock higher."", ""When analyzing a stock's fundamentals, one of the most common approaches is to look at the price to earnings ratio. As the title suggests, the P/E ratio divides the firm's share price with its earnings per share. For this purpose, three kinds of EPS can be used. These can be the earnings during the latest fiscal quarter, the trailing twelve month earnings, and forward earnings derived through analysis. The P/E ratio is then used to classify a stock as a growth or a value stock. A growth stock is one that has a high P/E ratio which indicates that investors are confident about paying a higher price today relative to the earnings as they expect that growth will push the earnings higher in the future."", ""Naturally, this makes growth stocks quite attractive since they carry the potential to deliver massive returns. As an illustration, consider the shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD's P/E ratio just a couple of years back was in the triple digits. This was when the firm had not expanded its chip production, so it was making little money. However, investors were confident that it could grow its market share in the future through successful product design and manufacturing scaling and valued it accordingly. These expectations materialized in the future (i.e. today) since AMD's stock is up by 474% over the past five years."", 'However, while high growth stocks are attractive and their performance is tightly linked to their fundamentals, a key factor to remember when considering them for an investment decision is the broader stock market climate. Shifts in the economy or the macroeconomic environment have the potential to either hammer growth stocks or push them to new highs. The latter was the case in 2022 as the fundamental dynamics that drove the stock market for the past decade rapidly shifted in the form of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Higher rates make it difficult for consumers to make pricey technology purchases, raise the stakes for hedge funds to invest in the stock market, and increase the working capital costs of running a business. All three drag down the stock market since they impact corporate performance.', 'With 2023 now coming to a close, this dynamic appears to be shifting. For instance, consider a new report by the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which maps out money flows into equity funds. This report shows that during the four trading sessions that ended on November 21, 2023, a net of $16.5 billion flew into the funds. Since October 9th, a whopping $40 billion has been piled into equities, which is perhaps the biggest indicator of the changing sentiment around stocks. This data is backed by more figures from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). It reveals that for the week ending on November 2023, U.S. equity funds received $6.27 billion. Sector wise, it was technology that shone, with $2.29 billion of net inflows during the time period. This is interesting since technology is a high growth sector with high P/E ratios. On the flip side, the relatively stable and value based utilities and healthcare sectors saw $382 million and $339 million in outflows - lending more credence to the fact that perhaps the era of growth investing is back.', 'There is more optimism in the stock market as well. As of Monday, November 20th, 55% of the S&P 500, which is up by 8% in November, was trading above its 200 day moving average. This is a positive development that indicates that a broader set of stocks (as opposed to the tech fueled rally in H1 2023) are on an upward trend. In technical trading, the 200 day moving average is a crucial resistance point that is often seen as a barrier to longer term share out performance.', 'So, as the stock market clouds start to clear, we thought to take a look at the best stocks to buy for high returns.

If you want to skip our introduction to Warren Buffett, his latest portfolio changes, and his firm, then take a look at Warren Buffett and Corporate Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. ', ""For anyone who even briefly follows the stock market, Warren Buffett is no stranger. His success in the stock market and the ability to pick out a handful of stocks among the thousands that change hands daily has made Mr. Buffett one of the richest people in the world. He makes his investments through the financial holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire's investments are not limited only to publicly traded companies. Instead, the firm also owns private businesses, and every quarter, it generates revenue from these investments."", ""The nature of Berkshire's income statements makes it necessary for the firm to take out sizeable stakes in at least some stocks that are part of its portfolio. This is because since Berkshire is not a hedge fund, it does not engage in traditional trading strategies such as leveraged puts or calls. Neither does it buy stocks simply to sell them later at a higher price. Instead, Berkshire's business model works by first investing in businesses that are revenue generators themselves, or sizeable and well established companies that can pay out dividends."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's investors have such a high amount of faith in Mr. Buffett and Charlie Munger that despite the fact that none of the dividends that are paid to Berkshire are paid to the shareholders, they continue to invest in the company. The dividends that Berkshire receives are sizeable too. Its financial statements show that during the first three quarters of 2023, Berkshire earned $4 billion through dividends, interest, and other income. In fact, two of Berkshire's biggest investments during the third quarter, namely the 915 million shares that it owns of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the 1 billion shares of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) led to nearly half a billion dollars of dividends being paid to Mr. Buffett's investment firm in a quarter."", ""Safe to say, trust is a central element in Warren Buffett's business model. Berkshire's investors believe that he and Mr. Munger can invest their money better than they would be able to do so. Therefore, they primarily derive value from their investment through the shares of Berkshire Hathaway relative to the U.S. dollar. A sound investment strategy contributes to share price appreciation at percentage levels that are greater than bonds, the broader market, or other financial instruments can offer. As an illustration, consider the share price returns of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). Over the past five years, a turbulent time period that has seen significant volatility in the stock market through a pandemic and then global geopolitical conflict, the S&P 500 index has gained 72.74%. The classes of Berkshire's shares, namely Class A and Class B, have gained 76.53% and 74.50%, respectively. This makes it clear that Berkshire's investors can do well even during stock market black swan events, and that the businesses that Mr. Buffett and his peers invest in end up performing better than a broader collection of stocks."", ""Large investment conglomerates and hedge funds don't simply invest in companies through their gut feelings. A large portion of their investment decisions are based on meetings with company management to gain a deeper understanding of the business model while not violating any insider trading laws. This is partly why professional investors are trusted by their clients, as their business insights often constitute advanced market signals that can contribute to broader share price appreciation down the road."", ""Before we get to the stocks that both Warren Buffett and corporate insiders love, a brief look at the latest investment decisions by Berkshire is also important. During the third quarter, Berkshire increased its investments in The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA) by buying roughly $2 billion worth of additional shares. Additionally, the firm also bought $7.9 million worth of shares of the holding company for the baseball company Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:BATRA).

To skip our detailed analysis of the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I)\xa0 practices within the current business landscape in 2023, go directly and see 5 Most Disabled-Friendly Countries in the World.', ""According to a 2018 report by McKinsey, the correlation between disability inclusion and the probability of financial outperformance will only continue to strengthen and bolster with the passage of time. Based on one of the organization's most extensive data sets ever conducted in the most disabled-friendly countries in the world, the report discovered that slow growths in diversity and inclusion initiatives within an organization almost always lead to hyper polarization amongst employees in specific, and a tenuous and inhospitable work environment within the company, in general. The report also highlights that companies which tend to make enormous strides in incorporating a DE&I approach to their human resource machinery often undertake a business-led view. The McKinsey report outlined clearly that companies which accommodate disabled individuals within their workforces tend to outperform less inclusive peers dramatically. According to the report, companies in the top-quartile for disability inclusivity on executive teams were 45% percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth-quartile. The greater the level of inclusion, the higher the likelihood and scale of outperformance."", 'Gender diversity and inclusion is another factor which is causally related with outperformance in business. Companies with more than 30% women executives are generally better-positioned to outperform companies where women represent less than 10% of the workforce.\xa0 Despite the fact that overall progress on gender and disability inclusion has been slower than initially expected, this does not consistently apply across all organizations, many of which are located in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world. Companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),\xa0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) have gone further than most companies to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion in their respective operations and have paved the way for other companies to follow suit. To know more about companies which incorporate a robust diversity and inclusion policy, check out our article on the 20 Best Companies to Work For in 2023.', 'Post the pandemic, consumer interaction with digital devices has quadrupled. However, companies are only now waking up to the fact that although digitization has streamlined everyday tasks for many consumers, it has not always provided an optimal customer experience for everyone. More than two billion people around the world identify as visually-impaired or low vision. The current state of the technology industry either ignores or misunderstands the enormous potential that this market represents. According to an article by McKinsey, there is enormous opportunity for companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) to cultivate strong, loyal relationships with this enormous segment of the market, especially in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world. The article projects that companies with inaccessible websites and digital strategies lose more than $6.9 billion annually as frustrated consumers with disabilities shift to competitors who offer more inclusive customer experiences. This cost to companies is expected to surge by 2030 as demand for accessible products and services skyrockets amidst rising life expectancy and a rapidly aging population.\xa0', 'Visually-impaired internet users forego more than 70% of their e-commerce and social media interactions because of inaccessibility, forcing them into considering more accessible options. In a survey, McKinsey discovered that disabled respondents cite digital trust as one of the most important considerations when purchasing a product, followed by product cost and delivery time. In other words, to navigate around inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic headwinds, companies can bolster resilience by engaging and securing this segment of the market which is relatively less concerned about product pricing. According to respondents, inaccessibility drives them to abandon entire market segments and companies altogether. To navigate around this, companies are diverting greater investments in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world to build up an accessible portfolio and improve customer experience for people with disabilities. One of the ways companies tend to achieve this is by activating accessibility and equity through inclusive design. Respondents have continually cited that cohesive user interfaces, collaborative design practices, and persistent improvements and upgrades are the foundational elements of good design and that good design and inclusive design tend to go hand-in-hand. Investing in good customer experience across the board is more cost-effective than addressing accessibility concerns after the fact.', ""Another way in which companies can retain the disabled segment of their consumer base is by investing in cohesive customer experiences. As companies raced to optimize customer experience in recent years, they began to prioritize customer's end-to-end journeys over individual touchpoints. These strategies need to be focused on attracting and retaining disabled consumers. Including a specially crafted digital persona for consumers with disabilities can facilitate digital-product developers and designers in ensuring accessibility and inclusivity into the overall customer experience from the very get-go. Companies must also engage in codesigning and collaborative practices to ensure that people with actual lived experiences serve as designers, developers, and advisers in some capacity, which in turn will pave the way for the company to deliver a market-leading, popular product and secure market share in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world."", 'According to a survey conducted by McKinsey in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world, companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) are diverting greater investments in establishing trust in products and experiences which leverage gen AI, data, and digital technologies to sustain growth. Research indicates that companies which are best positioned to cultivate digital trust amongst their consumer base are also more likely to have a robust diversity, equity and inclusion policy framework in place and are also expected to generate an annual growth rate of 10 percent or more on their top and bottom lines. Consumers are convinced that digital trust tenets like data protection, data ethics, and accessibility and inclusion practices are the most important factors when it comes to purchase decisions and many companies have begun to recognize this and comply. For instance, in their latest iPhone, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ensured new features for cognitive and visual accessibility like live speech, personal voice commands, and Point and Speak in Magnifier. According to a press release by the company, these updates draw on improvements in hardware and software, and ""expand on Apple\'s long standing commitment to making products for everyone"".', 'Furthermore, the digital world is an incredibly dynamic and transformational place, with constant upgrades and innovations rendering once-accessible features completely obsolete. Companies are now focusing on creating a culture of continuous improvement and upgrade which will build internal potential in developers to check for changes in inclusivity as soon as new upgrades are put on the market. Although this can be outsourced to accessibility organizations which provide guidance and support, the sheer volume in which digital updates are carried out demands companies to invest in those who work on the products directly.', 'To compile our list of the 20 most disabled-friendly countries in the world, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research which studied accessibility and inclusion in different countries (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). We then shortlisted more than 42 countries which appeared most frequently during our research. Since disability-friendliness is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the overall accessibility in each country; the criteria is premised on accessibility in infrastructure (20 points), employment opportunities (15 points), and social inclusion (10 points). We then proceeded to award each country a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 20 countries which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest.

These large, stable markets sustain persistent and considerable demand driven by constant geopolitical and security challenges."", ""The primary trend which is likely to seep into 2024 and affect the growth of the global defense industry is the increasing pressure exerted by supply chain challenges on the U.S. defense industrial base. A result of Western support for Ukraine amidst Russia-Ukraine conflict, munitions are being spent on the Ukrainian front at rates far exceeding normal lean-production delivery models exercised by the industry in recent years. According to a report by the Financial Times, Ukraine's crusade against Putin, who is one of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, is consuming armament at an unprecedented frequency.

Threats may range from adversaries seeking to steal or disrupt the development of equipment, to seizing control of hostile drones and other susceptible systems. Militaries around the world are diverting increased investments in ramping up their cybersecurity apparatus in order to ensure future and continuous success on the physical and digital battlefield. According to a market research report by Precedence Research, the global cybersecurity market is currently valued at more than $210.5 billion and is projected to reach $691.6 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.58% during the forecast period 2022-2032.

One of the primary reasons why defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are struggling to attract competent talent is due to a massive demographic shift within global urban populations, which McKinsey terms a transition from a ""gray"" to ""green"" workforce. Much of the older workforce is nearing retirement and a younger demographic is swiftly moving into the labor stream. This shift gives rise to other different factors at play, such as a shift in employee preferences, expectations, and work conditions. Moreover, the Great Resignation is another powerful factor shaping employment prospects within the larger A&D industry, with surveys indicating that more than 46 percent of employees are looking to switch employment within the next six months. This is exacerbated by the fact that younger employees are twice as likely to switch jobs compared to their older counterparts. As a result of these trends, defense companies are seeing younger talent seep through the cracks and talent replacement rates plunge dramatically. Furthermore, as the older generation approaches retirement, younger people are switching jobs much more frequently and are lacking the essential skills needed to thrive in the defense business.', 'In order to overcome this labor crisis, companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), which cater to some of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, can focus on sourcing talent from a pool that numerous employers tend to ignore by making use of the 70 million workers in the US classified as skilled through alternative routes (STARs). This segment of the workforce often has the skills needed in higher-wage jobs but are conventionally ignored. Hence, hiring should be more geared towards community colleges, military service, and on-the-job learning. Secondly, defense companies must shift lenses with respect to the role of manager as someone who drives purpose and leads greener teams of employees which may exhibit a greater turnover rate. Furthermore, many companies are investing in creating nonlinear career paths, non-promotion based advancement mechanisms, and different forms of recognizing achievement. This can aid companies in better catering to an increasing demand for more visible and faster career progression and career optionality. McKinsey also highlights the need for instituting mechanisms which enable more frequent evaluation and discourse around diversity, equity and inclusion practices, coupled with the creation of employee resource groups which can better equip defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in satisfying the requirements of the greener cohort. According to research, employees in more efficient ERGs respond with higher positive inclusion score relative to employees in non-functional or ineffective ERGs. Since a reliable flow of labor is one of the essential preconditions to value creation, defense companies are diverting greater investments in models which have a proven track record of employee retention success. One of these models is the construction of a localized ""talent win room"", which accumulates resources from different organizations to curate a more efficient and seamless employee value proposition and onboarding process.\xa0', ""Don't Miss: Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World"", 'Photo by rob walsh on Unsplash ', ""To compile our list of the 20 most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, we decided to undertake a consensus based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research which studied individual and state power (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

The statement of objections here. What's interesting-- there's a couple of interesting things about this. First of all, this is in contrast with the British approval of the deal here. So, now you've got a little bit of a conundrum where one of the regulatory agencies has these concerns that now Amazon has to come back, or the two parties have to come back, and address."", ""This deal was announced back on August 5 of 2022, so this has been a long running situation that Amazon is waiting to get approved.

I think-- maybe some of this, too. As we saw a recent Reuters piece that suggested it was going to close. There wasn't going to be an issue. So maybe this is just some investors getting caught off guards. The date on the calendar, though, is February 14. That is when the Commission, apparently, is going to choose whether to approve the deal with concessions or block it."", ""JULIE HYMAN: That's very romantic, Valentine's Day. Let's talk about Crown Castle, too because that company is facing revived pressure from activist investor, Elliott Management, to make executive and board changes. Crown, by the way, Crown Castle issued a statement in response saying it is open to commencing a constructive engagement with Elliott. Those Crown Castle shares are moving higher today. This is a wireless tower operator. It leases out it's actually a REIT-- a real estate investment trust, and it leases out its towers to the wireless phone providers-- the Verizons and AT&T's of the world here."", ""It's down here today. We've seen a lot of pain in the REITs, so it's not unusual in that sense, but Elliott says the stock price is near six year lows. And the underperformance that they looked at back in 2020 is only worsened. That's according to Elliott managing partner, Jesse Cohen."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. So, this is Paul Singer making moves. This is his firm, Elliott Management, and they want to see changes. They disclosed this $2 billion stake. They want new management. They want new board leadership. They want to review the fiber business-- that's just among other issues. Saying they're going to nominate new directors for the majority of positions on Crown Castle's board."", 'And Elliott emphasized the stock price, as you noted, really near multi-year lows here.

Just looking year-to-date, American Tower, which is probably the closest competitor to Crown Castle, down about 4%."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Right.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Crown Castle, down about 20%.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Rough. And finally here, Domino's pizza getting a bullish call from TD Cowen. The firm raising its price target on the stock, citing optimism on the company's US turnaround. So, they like what they see here, Julie, they go-- their target goes to 430, it looks like, from 410. Say they are bullish on the company's US turnaround. A date on your calendar they mark would be December 7th. That is Domino's investor day, they note. Analysts saying that could be a turning point marking this, what they see, acceleration in US comparable sales."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Interesting here that they're looking at that date, and they also talk about the launch of Uber Eats at the end of this year for Domino's. Remember, there had been like years of reluctance to partner, right, with some of the companies like that. Although, I'm not sure from which end the reluctance was coming."", ""But in any case, they talk about some measures that the company will be taking in concert with that Uber Eats launch as being positive for the company.

There are more than 100 different types (referred to as serotypes) of pneumococcal bacteria, which can affect adults differently than children. Certain serotypes threaten to put more people at risk for invasive pneumococcal illnesses, such as bacteremia (infection in the bloodstream); bacteremic pneumonia (pneumonia with bacteremia); and meningitis (infection of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord), as well as non-invasive pneumonia (when pneumococcal disease is confined to the lungs).', 'While healthy adults can suffer from pneumococcal disease, patient populations particularly vulnerable to infection include older adults and those with certain chronic or immunocompromising health conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease and liver disease.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global defense industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Most Powerful Country Leaders In The World in 2023.', ""2023 has largely been characterized by a litany of geopolitical flashpoints and conflicts, with the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe seeing an unprecedented amount of turbulence. These conflicts arise within the backdrop of a larger Sino-American rivalry which proves to be a consistent flashpoint in today's geopolitical landscape, giving credence to some of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023. According to a report by PwC, this has caused global defense expenditure to skyrocket in recent years, with initial projections rising up to $2 trillion by 2026, growing at an average year-on-year of 1.1%. The United States represents more than 60% of the total market, with the rest coming from other powers around the world. These large, stable markets sustain persistent and considerable demand driven by constant geopolitical and security challenges."", ""The primary trend which is likely to seep into 2024 and affect the growth of the global defense industry is the increasing pressure exerted by supply chain challenges on the U.S. defense industrial base. A result of Western support for Ukraine amidst Russia-Ukraine conflict, munitions are being spent on the Ukrainian front at rates far exceeding normal lean-production delivery models exercised by the industry in recent years. According to a report by the Financial Times, Ukraine's crusade against Putin, who is one of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, is consuming armament at an unprecedented frequency. The country has been firing more than 4500 artillery rounds a day. This massive shift to a war footing has exacerbated a massive supply chain challenge as defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) race to increase the rate of production to refresh national stockpiles as well as maintain supplies to the country.\xa0"", ""Another trend likely to impact the global defense industry in 2024 is the growing risk of cyber attacks seen in recent years. Cybersecurity is an integral element of a modern state's military capabilities. Threats may range from adversaries seeking to steal or disrupt the development of equipment, to seizing control of hostile drones and other susceptible systems. Militaries around the world are diverting increased investments in ramping up their cybersecurity apparatus in order to ensure future and continuous success on the physical and digital battlefield. According to a market research report by Precedence Research, the global cybersecurity market is currently valued at more than $210.5 billion and is projected to reach $691.6 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.58% during the forecast period 2022-2032. To read more on trends affecting the global aerospace and defense industry in 2024, check out our coverage of the 15 Biggest Gun Companies in the World."", 'According to a report by McKinsey, the larger aerospace and defense industry is facing extreme competition with respect to securing adequate labor. This competition mainly springs from other more lucrative industries like the technology and healthcare industry which offer more attractive salaries and benefits. Although the technology industry has slowed down hiring considerably in the face of constant macroeconomic pressure, the report opines that the race to secure the best talent will only continue to garner more traction and momentum, especially in high-demand roles where shortage of adequate labor is more pronounced. One of the primary reasons why defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) are struggling to attract competent talent is due to a massive demographic shift within global urban populations, which McKinsey terms a transition from a ""gray"" to ""green"" workforce. Much of the older workforce is nearing retirement and a younger demographic is swiftly moving into the labor stream. This shift gives rise to other different factors at play, such as a shift in employee preferences, expectations, and work conditions. Moreover, the Great Resignation is another powerful factor shaping employment prospects within the larger A&D industry, with surveys indicating that more than 46 percent of employees are looking to switch employment within the next six months. This is exacerbated by the fact that younger employees are twice as likely to switch jobs compared to their older counterparts. As a result of these trends, defense companies are seeing younger talent seep through the cracks and talent replacement rates plunge dramatically. Furthermore, as the older generation approaches retirement, younger people are switching jobs much more frequently and are lacking the essential skills needed to thrive in the defense business.', 'In order to overcome this labor crisis, companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), which cater to some of the most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, can focus on sourcing talent from a pool that numerous employers tend to ignore by making use of the 70 million workers in the US classified as skilled through alternative routes (STARs). This segment of the workforce often has the skills needed in higher-wage jobs but are conventionally ignored. Hence, hiring should be more geared towards community colleges, military service, and on-the-job learning. Secondly, defense companies must shift lenses with respect to the role of manager as someone who drives purpose and leads greener teams of employees which may exhibit a greater turnover rate. Furthermore, many companies are investing in creating nonlinear career paths, non-promotion based advancement mechanisms, and different forms of recognizing achievement. This can aid companies in better catering to an increasing demand for more visible and faster career progression and career optionality. McKinsey also highlights the need for instituting mechanisms which enable more frequent evaluation and discourse around diversity, equity and inclusion practices, coupled with the creation of employee resource groups which can better equip defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in satisfying the requirements of the greener cohort. According to research, employees in more efficient ERGs respond with higher positive inclusion score relative to employees in non-functional or ineffective ERGs. Since a reliable flow of labor is one of the essential preconditions to value creation, defense companies are diverting greater investments in models which have a proven track record of employee retention success. One of these models is the construction of a localized ""talent win room"", which accumulates resources from different organizations to curate a more efficient and seamless employee value proposition and onboarding process.\xa0', ""Don't Miss: Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World"", 'Photo by rob walsh on Unsplash ', ""To compile our list of the 20 most powerful country leaders in the world in 2023, we decided to undertake a consensus based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research which studied individual and state power (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We then shortlisted more than 50 leaders which appeared most frequently during our research.

We then proceeded to award each leader a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 20 leaders which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest.

But many analysts are now warning that the recession that was expected in 2023 could now come in 2024. Mohamed El-Erian, a famous Egyptian-American economists who is also the former CEO of PIMCO, recently gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he talked about his rationale behind his worries regarding a 2024 recession. The economist said:', ""For the last year when people were saying we are going into recession in 2023, I pushed back. I kept on saying there's no reason we're going into recession. This economy is inherently strong. Balance sheets are robust. Now, I must say I'm more worried about 2024. And I'm more worried about 2024 for three reasons. One is the lagged effect of these massive increases in interest rates. They act with a lag. Second is that people's savings have been run down.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the retirement situation in the US and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Dividend Stocks To Consider.', ""Over three and a half years after the onset of COVID-19, the US continues to have approximately 2 million more retirees than initially projected, marking one of the most notable and lasting shifts in the country's workforce, as reported by Bloomberg. This unexpected rise in retirements is evident in the significant difference between the number of retirees currently and what was forecasted by a Federal Reserve economic model. Though the gap has decreased from 2.8 million late last year, it remains higher than anticipated and has even increased from 1.7 million in June. Even with the increasing population of retirees in the US, numerous baby boomers express that they lack adequate funds to sustain their retirement lifestyle."", ""In the current market landscape, investing for retirement requires a thoughtful and diversified approach. With economic uncertainties, varying interest rates, and market volatility, choosing the right investment avenues becomes pivotal. Due to these challenges, many ordinary Americans are struggling to retire comfortably with their existing income. Bankrate's September survey revealed that approximately 56% of employed or temporarily unemployed Americans believe they're falling short in saving for retirement. Additionally, nearly a quarter of workers admitted to not making any contributions to their retirement accounts for at least a year. Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst, made the following comments in the report:"", '“Amid the tumultuous developments of the past several years, including a short but severe recession and a period of high and sustained inflation, a majority of Americans say they’re not where they need to be to achieve their retirement savings goals.”', 'Retirement investments ideally balance growth potential with stability. Typically, a diversified portfolio involving a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can be beneficial. In addition to this, dividend stocks can be a valuable component of a retirement portfolio due to their potential to generate consistent income. These stocks belong to companies that regularly distribute a portion of their earnings to shareholders. For retirees seeking a reliable income stream, dividend-paying stocks can be beneficial as they provide a source of passive income. Over recent years, dividend stocks have demonstrated considerable returns. Conover et al. (2016) conducted an empirical study spanning more than 50 years of US data, from 1962 to 2014, revealing that investing in dividend-paying stocks not only boosts returns but also notably mitigates risk across both value and growth portfolios, regardless of market capitalization. Their findings highlighted that the risk reduction was particularly pronounced when combining growth and value styles. The study also indicated that dividend-paying growth stocks tend to yield higher returns compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This research underscores the diversification advantages gained by incorporating an income-focused strategy into an investment portfolio.', 'Also read: Retirement Stock Portfolio: 12 Consumer Stocks To Consider', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

The leading manufacturers in the sector, including General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG) demonstrated resilience by averaging a 22% return, factoring in dividends. While the broader market experienced significant fluctuations, these key players within the food industry showcased a steadiness that not only weathered the market storm but also yielded notable returns for investors, highlighting the sector's reliability even during uncertain economic times."", 'However, the landscape for food stocks shifted notably this year, as many experienced a significant downturn. The S&P Food and Beverage Select Industry, which tracks the performance of stocks belonging to various food subindustries, is down by 4.57% this year so far, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which gained 19.09% year-to-date. That said, Wedbush analysts believe that restaurant stocks already reflect a recession, which they think is a chance for investors to buy. They mentioned that these stocks are selling at lower prices, similar to what you might see in worse economic times, making it a good opportunity to invest in them. The typical full-service restaurant stock is being traded at roughly 13.8 times its expected earnings for 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500 is valued at around 18 times earnings. The analysts pointed out that such a difference in value has occurred only three times in the last 15 years.', 'The US is a market leader in the packaged food sector, holding a significant market share of 18.6% in 2023, according to Future Market Insight’s report. This industry has been influenced by trends associated with mindful eating, which gained immense importance following the pandemic. Presently, American consumers are prioritizing food products that align with their diverse health and sustainability goals, while also considering traditional objectives such as weight management when making their food choices.', ""US packaged food companies are gearing up for changes in their brand lineup as their pandemic success slows down and the effects of price increases begin to ease off. There's been an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the food industry during the first part of this year. While the total worth of deals in the US food and beverage sector decreased by nearly 3% to around $10.39 billion this year, the number of deals rose by 17.5% to 248 as of September 1, according to LSEG data. This surge in deal volumes highlights the food industry as a standout area for business deals."", 'As mentioned above, food stocks are often considered defensive investments due to the consistent demand for food regardless of economic conditions. Among these, companies in the food sector that pay dividends hold a particular appeal for investors. These dividend-paying food companies are favored for their stability and ability to generate regular income through dividends, which can be especially attractive in uncertain market environments.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL, United Airlines UAL and JetBlue Airways JBLU.', 'It is a well-documented fact that expenses on fuel represent a significant input cost for airlines. Therefore, the health of stocks in the Zacks Airline industry is inversely proportional to the movement of oil prices.', 'Oil prices were moving northward from July mainly due to the extension of production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia through the end of the current year. In fact, oil price surged 28.5% in the July-September period, in turn restricting bottom-line growth of many airline players in the third quarter of 2023.', 'Due to the northward movement of oil prices, average fuel price per gallon increased 10.3% sequentially at Delta Air Lines. Similarly, the metric increased 11%, 10.3% and 11.8% sequentially at American Airlines, United Airlines and JetBlue Airways, respectively, in third-quarter 2023.

You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'However, oil prices have stopped moving northward over the past month and have in fact declined 8.5% in November so far. Factors like an increase in supply, record U.S. oil production and dispute among the OPEC+ group of exporters regarding agreement on any additional production cuts have contributed to the reduction in oil prices.', 'This southward movement in oil prices is a welcome development for airline stocks. This is reflected in the fact that the Zacks Airline industry has appreciated 17.7% in a month’s time, well above the S&P 500’s 9.4% rise in the same time period.', 'Coupled with the southward oil price movement, the buoyant passenger volumes witnessed during the ongoing Thanksgiving travel period are another positive for airlines that have led to the price surge.', 'A mind-boggling 30 million passengers are expected to be screened between Nov 17 and Nov 28, a record high, per the Transportation Security Administration. The decline in airfares supports the upbeat traffic projection.', 'Delta expects 6.2-6.4 million passengers to avail its flights in the Nov 17-28 timeframe.

180,d8ec5100-7bfd-34e3-a217-0f89bf62680d,UAL,2023-11-28,White House gives Flexport shoutout for sustainable aviation fuel,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-gives-flexport-shoutout-203953207.html,1701117593,STORY,"['LHA.DE', 'UAL']","['Freight forwarder Flexport picked up a surprising endorsement from the White House during this month’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum for its new initiative to help customers reduce their supply chain emissions for airfreight shipments.', 'The Biden administration highlighted efforts to decarbonize aviation at the meeting in San Francisco, where world leaders pledged continued cooperation on addressing climate change, in the process giving visibility to a company headquartered in the same city for a program similar to ones previously undertaken by a number of airlines and cargo partners.', 'A fact sheet outlined more than $50 billion of U.S. private-sector investments into APEC economies related to trade, sustainability and other goals, including an announcement by Boeing that it will work with Asia-Pacific nations and U.S. government to advance development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and promote its use by the region’s airlines. And it said Flexport is partnering with Norway-based Chooose to offer air cargo customers a way to purchase SAF certificates that can be applied against freight movements with any vendor.', 'The APEC communique also mentioned Flexport’s September announcement of an omnichannel capability for small and midsize enterprises that allows them one-click ability to create a single pool of inventory and import, warehouse, sort and deliver goods directly to stores or consumers for orders placed on more than 20 e-commerce marketplaces.', 'President Joe Biden also acknowledged Flexport in remarks during a speech to CEOs at the summit.', '“American businesses — significantly represented here in this auditorium — are the largest source of foreign direct investment into APEC economies. In fact, if we take just the U.S. companies represented here at this summit and look at their new investments [into] APEC economies in the calendar year, it totaled more than $50 billion so far. … Investments announced today from companies like Boeing, Apple, Flexport, and the Pepsi company — to make our economies greener and more sustainable,” he said', 'A Flexport spokesperson said the company shared the announcements with White House staff organizing the APEC event as an example of how its service gives small businesses the technology and capital to grow sustainably.', 'The Flexport listings are only indirectly connected to $50 billion APEC investment theme and don’t have any specific price tags associated with them. Neither program is specifically focused on the Asia-Pacific region, although in reality the self-service global trade solution could apply because that is where e-commerce retail goods are mostly produced and where Flexport has some logistics infrastructure. And the SAF program applies to freight movement anywhere in the world, not just on the trans-Pacific corridor.', 'Flexport controls the use of three Boeing 747-400 freighter aircraft and arranges shipments with other cargo and passenger airlines, but its SAF program functions independently from the physical flow of goods in its system while allowing customers to purchase the environmental benefits through a practice called book-and-claim.', 'The book-and-claim model for air cargo is not unique to Flexport. European logistics powers Kuehne+Nagel, DB Schenker and DSV, among others, offer virtual SAF purchases through their reservation channels.', 'Distributing SAF to a specific airport or flight is difficult because of limited fuel availability and infrastructure. Under aviation’s book-and-claim model, SAF isn’t dropped into the flight of the company covering the fuel premium. Instead, the volume of SAF that is produced and pumped into planes is tracked and verified, after which related carbon emissions are calculated and allotted to the business that “booked” the purchase of SAF. The customer paying the premium receives a SAF certificate to lay “claim” to the environmental benefits, which it can apply to reduce its indirect carbon footprint.', 'Using this method means SAF can be sourced for flights with airlines or out of airports that do not have SAF supply available. It’s a similar approach to buying renewable energy credits because consumers can’t physically control where their electricity comes from.', 'Flexport’s program is enabled by Chooose, a software-as-a-service platform that helps businesses integrate climate programs directly into their online sales offerings, and is available through a digital connection with the Flexport trade portal.', '“This means democratized access to SAF through the book and claim chain-of-custody model, which allows Flexport customers to reduce their emissions for any air freight shipment on any trade lane with any carrier,” Flexport said in a statement. “When clients purchase a SAF certificate, book and claim ensures that a proportional volume of fuel is used somewhere within the aviation sector resulting in a net-reduction. For our clients, this flexibility ensures that consignees of any size can contribute to emissions reduction without having to arrange for large fuel offtake agreements directly with air carriers or fuel suppliers.”', 'Kuehne+Nagel two years ago became the first air logistics provider to offer customers the option to purchase SAF for each shipment regardless of airlines used, origin or destination. Pricing is tied to the actual weight of a shipment. After booking confirmation, the equivalent volume of SAF is credited from 3.4 million gallons of SAF available to Kuehne+Nagel while the customer receives an authorized certificate confirming the emissions saving for environmental reporting.', 'Aviation accounts for an estimated 2%-3% of global carbon emissions but is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize because of technological hurdles and the heavy investment required. SAF, which proponents say reduces earth-warming emissions by 70% and costs three to four times as much as conventional jet fuel, is considered a bridge to a hydrogen or electric future. It amounts to just 0.2% of total global jet fuel consumption. The International Air Transport Association says demand signals from airlines should spur governments and energy producers to heavily invest in production and distribution infrastructure. Much more SAF needs to be produced to meet current demand and the airline industry’s commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.', 'SAF can be produced from a number of sources, including waste fats, oils and greases, municipal solid waste, agricultural and forestry residues, and nonfood crops. They can also be produced synthetically via a process that captures carbon directly from the air. About 10 facilities currently produce SAF, but more than 150 projects in 35 countries are being explored for SAF production by 2029. Some analysis shows that up to 25 million tons of SAF could be produced by the next decade, according to the cross-sector Air Transport Action Group.', 'It should be noted that SAF still produces some carbon emissions in flight but generally releases less carbon dioxide during the production and refining phase than fossil fuels.', 'Airlines have entered into forward purchase agreements for SAF worth about $45 billion, well in excess of today’s SAF availability, IATA says. Fifty airlines representing over 40% of global air traffic have committed to more than 5% of their own fuel use being SAF in 2030, with many setting higher goals.', 'And logistics companies are increasingly partnering with airlines to directly subsidize the cost of SAF purchases.', 'As part of a multipronged decarbonization effort, Air France-KLM Group three years ago launched a SAF program that now includes more than 50 companies. Chicago-based AIT Worldwide Logistics recently joined the program and agreed to purchase 460 metric tons of SAF from Air France-KLM-Martinair Cargo for 2023, with even higher volumes committed for 2024. In October, the group’s cargo division introduced goSAF, which allows customers to reduce their carbon emissions per booked shipment by making a direct investment in SAF. In the first week after the feature was introduced, a SAF contribution was added to more than 1,000 bookings.', 'Lufthansa Cargo has also been out front reducing carbon pollution and promoting the use of SAF. The airline and Kuehne+Nagel jointly committed to support the world’s first production site for synthetic crude oil in Germany and are already buying small quantities from a nonprofit called Atmosfair. The partnership built on K+N’s existing agreement to help subsidize purchases of SAF fuel made from biowaste.', 'Synthetic kerosene, also known as power-to-liquid fuel, is produced from regeneratively generated electricity, water and CO2. Power-based fuels are still in the development stage but are considered a long-term alternative to conventional jet fuel or bio-generated SAF because they can theoretically be produced without availability limits.', 'In February, Lufthansa Cargo parent company Deutsche Lufthansa signed a memorandum of understanding with European energy company Varo to supply SAF. Varo plans to produce 86 million gallons per year from 2026 with a long-term target of 165 million gallons annually. The company in September announced plans to build a major SAF manufacturing facility in Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'German logistics giant DB Schenker and Lufthansa Cargo in 2021 started regular full charter flights between Frankfurt and Shanghai that are 100% covered by sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable waste and residue raw materials such as used cooking oils. That means Lufthansa blends in the same amount of SAF on flights throughout its network to equalize the amount of fuel used on the charter flight. Computer hardware maker Lenovo has regularly booked space on the flights.', 'Last November, DB Schenker began giving customers the option of choosing SAF for their air transport to any location in the world — independent of the type of aircraft or airline used. Shippers pay a premium for virtual allocation of SAF for an air cargo shipment and receive certification for the amount of greenhouse gases avoided. The actual physical insertion of SAF might occur on flights different from the one carrying the freight. DB Schenker has also purchased SAF credits from Singapore Airlines.', 'Denmark-based logistics power DSV last year similarly struck an agreement with Etihad Cargo, the cargo division of Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi, to purchase SAF to offset the carbon emissions of its shipments utilizing a book-and-claim system.', 'Japanese freight forwarder Kintetsu World Express in 2022 committed to use SAF on Lufthansa Cargo flights for one year, reducing by 5% its total CO2 footprint for shipments transported by the airline.', 'Korean Air last week announced logistics company LX Pantos as the inaugural partner for its new SAF program for cargo customers. LX Pantos will purchase SAF for Korean Air’s cargo operations and the airline will share the amount of carbon emissions reduced accordingly. Last year, the airline signed an agreement with Shell to purchase SAF at major airports in Asia and the Middle East from 2026 to 2031.', 'A number of airlines have even committed equity and risk capital into SAF projects. United Airlines, for example, this year started a $200 million fund to help support startups developing sustainable aviation fuel. Air Canada, JetBlue and Hawaiian Airlines are also contributing.', 'London Heathrow Airport will offer $89 million of incentives to airlines in 2024 in an effort to boost SAF to 2.5% of total fuel usage. The scheme, now in its second year, cuts the price gap between kerosene and its greener alternative by about half. The airport aims for 11% SAF usage by 2030, scaling up the incentive each year.', 'Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic has received approval from the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel for the first-ever long-haul test flight across the Atlantic Ocean, from London to New York, on Tuesday.', 'Governments have recognized the importance of SAF in making aviation more environmentally sustainable. The European Parliament has mandated the incremental use of SAF from 2025 onward, while the U.S. government has created incentive programs to help scale up SAF production over the next decade. Critics say more governmental support is needed to lower costs, increase production and de-risk private investment in alternative fuels.', 'A UN gathering of more than 100 countries in Dubai on Friday agreed to an interim goal of 5% carbon reduction in aviation by 2030 through a transition to SAF by using less carbon intensive aviation fuels. The aviation sector’s long-term goal is for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.', 'Lower carbon aviation fuels are fossil fuels that are produced with improved production techniques to reduce their life cycle CO2 emissions compared to traditionally produced fossil fuels. They can be around 10% less carbon intensive and could provide a good interim measure until SAF can be scaled up.', 'A large majority of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) members also agreed on a global framework for cleaner fuels, which includes capacity building for less developed nations and giving airlines benefits against decarbonization obligations based on uniform SAF accounting principles.', 'Stakeholders agreed to work together to increase global production of SAF and other cleaner fuels, as well as improve standards, regulatory frameworks, infrastructure and engine technology to support the shift to alternative fuels. They said the interim goal would help bring in investors.', '“A shift towards a replacement of fossil fuels by SAF will require significant investment. The agreement today helps to provide another layer of certainty to unlock the trillions in capital needed,” said Haldane Dodd, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, in a statement. “Aviation has provided a near-term objective and the global framework. Now it is up to the finance community and energy sector to support the necessary infrastructure and start delivering SAF in ever increasing quantities.', '“A global average goal allows some parts of the world to move fast and develop their existing base of SAF deployment whilst leaving room for other states to build up the capabilities needed for SAF production and use,” said Dodd.', 'During the event, ICAO and Airbus signed a declaration of intent to explore the feasibility of SAF development and deployment in South America, initially focusing on\xa0 three countries.', 'Dubai-based Emirates on Wednesday became the first airline to operate an A380 flight using 100% SAF in one of its four engines, demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for jet fuel on commercial flights. Earlier this year, Emirates successfully completed the first 100% SAF-powered demonstration flight in the region on a GE90-powered Boeing 777-300 Extended Range. The airline recently expanded its partnership with Neste for the supply of over 3 million gallons of blended SAF in 2024 and 2025 for flights departing from Amsterdam Schiphol and Singapore Changi airports. It currently uplifts SAF in Norway and France.', 'Environmentalists said the Dubai agreement lacks any enforcement mechanism and doesn’t specify what fuels airlines would use to reach the 5% global target, Reuters reported.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.', 'Contact Reporter: ekulisch@freightwaves.com\xa0', 'Air cargo sector plays bigger role in CO2 emissions reduction', 'The post White House gives Flexport shoutout for sustainable aviation fuel appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

While some of these disasters occur seasonally, others tend to come without any prior warning. Amidst rising global emissions, there is an increasing risk of wildfires in the west of the US as a result of forests and farmland drying out.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the real estate industry, head directly to 5 Best REIT Stocks To Buy Right Now.', 'Global markets are facing a dilemma caused by significantly higher borrowing expenses, which seem likely to remain high, alongside a scarcity of homes leading to inflated property prices. This situation has resulted in increasing housing affordability issues in many regions. Property owners with loans subject to readjustment are experiencing growing financial pressure. In the US, where 30-year mortgages are common, the housing market is at a standstill. People with low-rate mortgages are hesitant to sell, and buyers are finding it difficult to make purchases. Similarly, as per Bloomberg, house values have not dropped much in places like New Zealand and Canada, leaving some buyers who paid high prices struggling with larger loan payments. Landlords in different countries, from the UK to South Korea, are also facing challenges. Higher interest rates are making it harder to build new properties in several locations.\xa0', 'Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, anticipates that US 30-year mortgage rates, currently around 7.4%, will likely average about 5.5% over the next decade, compared to the low of 2.65% in early 2021. He predicts a similar increase in most other developed countries, although the specific levels may differ. He said:', '“The golden age of single-family housing is behind us. If you bought in the wake of the financial crisis, you built up a lot of equity in most parts of the world, but the next 10 years is going to be more of a slog.”', 'Last year, the real estate industry aimed to weather risks and set up for a period of lasting growth and better returns. However, this year, industry leaders interviewed by PwC are confronting a new reality. They no longer anticipate a complete return to pre-pandemic norms. Instead, they are acknowledging that many individuals may not return to the office as frequently or at all. This shift poses implications not just for office owners, managers, and brokers but also for downtown areas and other property sectors reliant on a strong office market. Moreover, there is a prevailing acceptance in the industry that interest rates will likely remain elevated for at least the upcoming year, or potentially longer. Even positive news, like increased investor interest in acquiring new assets, is overshadowed by disappointing sector statistics. For instance, despite available funding, real estate transactions have decreased. Many attribute this decline to disagreements between buyers and sellers over pricing due to limited sales, hindering price clarity. However, amidst these challenges, respondents in PwC’s ‘Emerging Trends’ survey anticipate that the worst of inflation might be in the past, possibly giving the Federal Reserve cause to stop interest rate hikes.', 'On October 7, in an interview with Fox Business, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman responded to the state of the U.S. real estate market, cautioning prospective homebuyers that any relief from the extremely challenging economic conditions might not be guaranteed in 2024. He stated:', '""You\'ll have to ask the Fed when the market\'s going to get better, because it seems very unlikely that interest rates will ease by the end of this year. So, the only real question is whether we\'re going to catch a break entering the home buying season of 2024. But I think most people have written off the 2023 home buying season.""', ""Despite ongoing concerns, global economies are holding up reasonably well, showing some clearer areas amid persistent uncertainties, according to Deloitte. Heading into 2024, the global economy faces multiple challenges. Yet, early responses to banking troubles in 2023, strong consumer demand, and steady energy and food prices have provided some stability. The global real estate industry sees an opportunity to strengthen its foundations in 2024. Different factors, such as changes in work patterns due to pandemic recovery and recent uncertainties in global affairs and financial markets, make the year ahead crucial for real estate firms. With mixed signals about the industry's health, real estate leaders may need to navigate uncertainties while reshaping future ownership and investment strategies. The next 12 to 18 months are pivotal for real estate firms to adapt, requiring crucial insights and strategic changes, some differing from current practices."", 'Even though the industry is facing headwinds currently, elite hedge funds have been piling into REIT stocks, some of which include American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Prologis, Inc.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

In 2021 the guiding story was the stimulus-infused post-COVID rebound. In 2022 it was an inflationary hangover that brought back memories of the 1980s.', 'As for 2023, well, let’s just say it has stumped the storytellers. A year ago there was near consensus that the Federal Reserve’s inflation-fighting interest rate hikes would spark a recession in the U.S., but it didn’t turn out that way—or at least it hasn’t yet.', 'After that head fake, Wall Street’s top minds are unusually divided about what’s coming for the economy, and by extension the stock market. The uncertain impact of higher-for-longer interest rates, the AI boom, and rising geopolitical tensions has led to some wildly divergent outlooks among forecasters—from Deutsche Bank’s prediction of a major recession to Goldman Sachs’ view that an economic reacceleration lies ahead, driven by a still-strong job market.', 'It’s the kind of environment where stock investors often benefit from playing defense and offense simultaneously. On one hand, investors should look to hold companies that have strong balance sheets, steady cash flows, low debt levels, and the ability to maintain pricing power—the defensive qualities that help companies do well when inflation or high interest rates exert a drag on the broader economy. At the same time, they shouldn’t ignore firms that are aligned with long-term trends that could generate outsize growth in the future. (And yes, the adoption of AI is one of those trends.)', 'With this backdrop in mind, Fortune asked seven of Wall Street’s most well-respected investors and analysts for their top stock picks for 2024. The diverse mix of companies they mentioned range from sturdy, predictable consumer-staples plays to bets on a new technological revolution. In a time of uncertainty, these picks should provide a mix of safety and opportunity, no matter what happens in the broader economy.', 'AI may be the most important technological advance of our lifetimes—one that Wall Street analysts have already compared to the internet, the automobile, and even electrification. But while there’s broad consensus that AI will eventually revolutionize the economy and boost corporate earnings, the timing and depth of those revolutionary and profitable changes are a subject of hot debate. Some bears argue that where the stock market is concerned, AI hype has run too far ahead of reality—setting up a few richly valued stocks for a tumble if the economy slows.', 'Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, thinks the AI pessimists risk missing out. “The bears try to look smart while the bulls make money,” he comments. Ives believes investors should be “macro-aware, but micro-focused” in 2024. That means understanding the risks to the economy but not missing out on big opportunities from the technological revolution that is AI.', 'Two AI-linked stocks came up time and again among our investors: Microsoft, which has leaped into the lead in the AI arms race thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and semiconductor maker Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) are pivotal components of the AI revolution. Each has already seen its stock soar on the back of AI enthusiasm—but bulls agree there are more gains ahead.', 'Mark Baribeau, head of global equity at Jennison Associates, which manages $175\xa0billion in assets, calls Nvidia his top stock for 2024. He highlighted the company’s impressive margins, strong revenue growth, and dominant position in GPUs, which are critical pieces of hardware in training AI systems. “With generative artificial intelligence, we’re entering the fourth era of computing. And the most important company in the fourth era of computing will be Nvidia,” Baribeau says.', 'Jennison has a nearly 1% stake in Nvidia, and its faith has paid off in 2023, with the stock surging 238% through mid-November. But Baribeau believes Nvidia remains undervalued, noting that it trades at about 25 times its estimated fiscal 2025 earnings—below its five-year historical price-to-earnings average.', '“With generative artificial intelligence, we’re entering the fourth era of computing. And the most important company in the fourth era of computing will be Nvidia.”', 'Mark Baribeau, head of global equity at Jennison Associates', 'Jay Hatfield, founder and CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management, an investment firm and active ETF manager, also calls Nvidia his favorite stock for 2024. Hatfield argues that investors should play the AI revolution in a way that would have proved successful at other periods of great technological change—by buying industry leaders that are already turning the new technology into meaningful revenue. “It was a great idea to buy internet stocks,” he says. “But it really worked if you went after the most established companies with the clearest avenues for success.” Nvidia, he says, is one such company.', 'If Nvidia is an AI hardware play, Microsoft is an opportunity to benefit from the immense growth in cloud computing that AI is catalyzing. “Redmond is gaining more and more cloud market share,” Ives says, referring to Microsoft’s headquarters. Wedbush believes AI workloads alone could increase Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue by 20% or 25% over the next two or three years.', 'Richard Saperstein, founding principal and chief investment officer of Treasury Partners, is another Microsoft believer. He cites the firm’s diverse mix of businesses (from software to LinkedIn) as a key strength, as well as its strong free cash flow and its $143\xa0billion pile of cash.', 'Ever the tech bull, Saperstein also likes a competing Big Tech giant—Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Microsoft and OpenAI, with ChatGPT, have certainly generated more buzz than Google and Bard, but the broader contest is anything but over. “The race to monetize AI, it’s in the early innings,” he says. “I wouldn’t write [Alphabet] off so quickly.” Saperstein believes Alphabet is trading at an attractive valuation, after a recent selloff owing to worse-than-forecasted cloud growth numbers. He also points to the roughly $100\xa0billion that Alphabet has spent on research and development, including on AI, over the past four years—investments that he believes are bound to pay dividends.', 'Big Tech players aren’t the only options for betting on an AI surge. Tom Lee, cofounder and head of research at investment research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, dubs the electronic design automation (EDA) firm Cadence Design Systems his top pick for 2024. Cadence’s design software plays a key role in the design and development of the critical semiconductors that have made AI a reality—indeed, Nvidia is one of its main customers.', 'The company expects total revenue of just over $4\xa0billion in fiscal year 2023, but its place in the AI supply chain had earned it a market cap of $74\xa0billion as of mid-November. Lee argues that the firm is in a “unique” and “dominant” position in EDA and chip-design markets in which there are few other competitors. Underscoring his point: The type of software that Cadence offers is so critical for semiconductor firms that the U.S. Department of Commerce enacted export controls on it last year, in an effort to prevent China from creating cutting-edge semiconductors.', 'Among companies that create more general AI software applications, Ives calls data analytics firm Palantir Technologies the “purest-play AI name in the market” today. Denver-based Palantir expects 2023 revenues of roughly $2.2\xa0billion and had a market cap of $43\xa0billion in mid-November. After operating for years as a secretive but much-hyped startup, Palantir has found a groove as a publicly traded company: It has been profitable for four consecutive quarters and has no long-term debt. And Ives notes that the company, whose AI software customers include U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies, is likely to increase its revenues in an era of rising global tensions. “In this geopolitical storm, clearly, it’s a company that will benefit,” he said.', 'This fall the Federal Reserve sent a host of signals that its fight against inflation might be close to an end. But even if rates don’t climb further, some forecasters believe a recession is inevitable because of the impact of higher-for-longer rates.', 'Eli Salzmann, portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap value strategies at Neuberger Berman, a firm that oversees over $435\xa0billion in assets, is one of those bears. In fact, he believes “we are entering a recession as we speak … It’s not going to be pretty over the next six to 12 months, especially the corresponding effect on the markets.” Salzmann’s advice to investors: Look to more defensive stocks, including the consumer staples giant Procter & Gamble and the diversified health care products leader Johnson & Johnson.', 'He highlights Procter & Gamble’s strong pricing power, solid free cash flow, and low ratio of debt to earnings. Most important, he notes that the company’s revenues tend to be resilient during recessions. “When times get tough, you’re still going to brush your teeth with their toothpaste and you’re still going to wash your clothes with their laundry detergent,” he says. Procter & Gamble has also spent years reinvesting in its brands to regain market share in key consumer categories including beauty and oral care, and Salzmann says the company is primed to “slowly get repaid for that investment.”', '“When times get tough, you’re still going to brush your teeth with their toothpaste and you’re still going to wash your clothes with their laundry detergent.”', 'Eli Salzmann, portfolio manager of U.S. large-cap value strategies at Neuberger Berman', 'Salzmann notes that pharmaceutical companies also tend to outperform in times of economic uncertainty, and for similar reasons: Consumers and doctors won’t stop taking and prescribing medications just because the economy is shaky. With Johnson & Johnson, the main draw is the firm’s robust pipeline of drugs under development. “It’s pretty exciting,” Salzmann says. “There is serious multibillion-dollar annual sales potential from some of these drugs.” He points to positive outlooks for Johnson & Johnson’s new treatments for multiple myeloma, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Some insurance companies also generate stable revenues in recessionary times. Haruki Toyama, head of the large-cap and midcap equity team at Madison Investments, pointed to the global property and casualty insurance company Arch Capital Group as his top pick for 2024. Arch isn’t a household name, but it does business in North America, Europe, and Australia, and its offerings include energy, marine, and aviation insurance, as well as specialty services for travel and commercial surety products that protect against fraud or theft. The company grew its revenues 36% year over year in the third quarter and is on track to generate about $13\xa0billion in revenue in 2023.', 'Arch is “the best managed insurer in the world,” according to Toyama, who points to the firm’s diversification and its track record of quickly pivoting to emphasize the most profitable types of coverage. It also trades at just 11 times earnings, and “it’s not really that correlated to the general economy,” Toyama says. “It’s sort of like a subscription business … So it’s very steady.”', 'Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted the world’s energy supplies, and many economists fear that the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict and rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China could soon do the same. Those hotspots are already a factor in today’s elevated oil prices, but growing conflict could mean even greater price increases. Even without the geopolitical tensions, there has been a lack of investment in oil and natural gas production for years, owing in part to the green energy transition and to investors’ demands that energy companies return more profits to shareholders. The International Energy Agency warned in September that, as a result, oil supplies “will be at uncomfortably low levels” in 2024.', 'Energy-sector stocks offer investors some protection from energy-related economic shocks. Fundstrat’s Lee believes that against this backdrop, the oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil offers upside next year. “I think there is going to always be upward pressure on price,” Lee says. “And I think companies like Exxon are really well positioned to capture a lot of that upside.”', 'Lee notes that Exxon was trading this fall at a very appealing valuation of just 10 times earnings. In a worst-case scenario where the economy struggles badly enough to hurt oil and gas consumption, Exxon will provide income for investors: It currently pays a 3.6% dividend. It also generated $11.7\xa0billion in free cash flow in the third quarter alone, which means it has the resources available to invest in its growth and buy back shares.', 'Hatfield of Infrastructure Capital Management highlights Kinder Morgan as another firm that should benefit as global instability makes U.S. domestic energy production increasingly important. The energy infrastructure company owns 82,000 miles of oil and natural gas pipelines and 140 natural gas terminals, and has 700\xa0billion cubic feet of operated natural gas storage capacity in North America.', 'Kinder Morgan also transports a little less than half of all U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) through its pipelines, and it’s likely to benefit from the ongoing boom in LNG exports. The IEA estimates that the U.S. share of global LNG exports will grow from 20% in 2022 to almost 30% by 2026. To meet these needs, U.S.-based producers will likely need to use the pipelines and export terminals that Kinder Morgan operates, executive chairman Rich Kinder explained in a recent earnings call.', 'Kinder Morgan’s stock has struggled in 2023—falling 10% between January and the end of September—after natural gas prices retreated from last year’s Ukraine war-induced highs, but Hatfield believes investors are missing the bigger picture. “We don’t think that people have appreciated that the U.S. is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. We are going to continue to need to transport and export more and more of it. And Kinder Morgan will take advantage of that,” he says. Kinder Morgan trades at just 15 times forward earnings, has steady cash flows, and offers a sizable 6.7% dividend yield.', 'Since the end of the pandemic, the U.S. economy and its stock indexes have outpaced most of the rest of the developed world. But Baribeau of Jennison Associates argues that investors can also find companies abroad that offer steady, stable growth.', 'He points to the Argentinean e-commerce giant MercadoLibre as one option, calling it the “Amazon of Latin America.” The company is benefiting from the ongoing digital transformation in South and Central America, Baribeau says. MercadoLibre’s e-commerce business has been a fast grower for years; in the third quarter, its income from operations jumped 131% year over year to $685\xa0million, a new quarterly record.', 'MercadoLibre, whose stock trades on the Nasdaq exchange, has also leaned into fintech, creating a digital payments platform called Mercado Pago that’s akin to Venmo but also offers payment processing for businesses. “They had to create a digital payments mechanism to help underbanked populations actually buy things online,” Baribeau explains. “That financial technology platform has now morphed into a significant generator of wealth creation for the company.” Mercado Pago had roughly 50\xa0million active users as of the end of the third quarter, up from under 20\xa0million in 2020. The company’s leaders say that it’s gaining market share from competitors as well, particularly in Mexico and Brazil.', 'Baribeau also highlights Hermès, the 185-year-old French luxury goods manufacturer, as a top pick for 2024. He noted that the company has great brand recognition and boasts a direct-to-consumer business model that provides a unique level of pricing power. “You can only buy their product from them on their website,” Baribeau says. “Even if you find them in a high-end department store, [Hermès is] going to control that inventory.” Tight inventory controls allow Hermès to avoid mismatches in supply and demand that could pressure the company to sell goods at a discount. The company can also rely on a base of high-net-worth customers who are inflation- and recession-proof compared with the average consumer. “Their clientele is more likely to weather any storm,” he says.', 'As Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett famously said during the depths of the Great Recession of 2008, sometimes it pays to be greedy when others are fearful. For Hatfield of Infrastructure Capital Management, this could be a good time for some investors to take advantage of the fear in the beaten down commercial real estate (CRE) sector. Rising interest rates and the work-from-home trend combined to pummel this sector over the past year, but the selloff could be overdone in some quality names.', 'Hatfield highlights the real estate investment trust (REIT) Boston Properties, which owns and develops luxury residential, retail, and office properties in major cities including Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The REIT owns 190 properties, from the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco to the Prudential Center in Boston, that together encompass 53.5\xa0million square feet and generated more than $3.1\xa0billion in revenue in 2022.', 'For the year through mid-November, shares in the trust were down almost 30%, leading it to trade at just 7.5 times its funds from operations (FFO)—a metric commonly used to value REITs—and pushing its dividend yield over 7%. (Yields rise as a percentage of share price when a stock’s price falls.) Still, according to Hatfield, Boston Properties could benefit from a boom in demand for office space from AI developers, future interest rate cuts, and the attenuation of the WFH trend. “We think people are hating on offices way too much, particularly in the major markets,” Hatfield says. “We don’t think investors are distinguishing between the highest- and lowest-quality companies.”', 'Indeed, there’s a takeaway here that investors can apply to the markets in general in 2024: When uncertain times drive stock prices down, they sometimes turn good companies into bargains.', 'Microsoft (MSFT, $370)', 'Nvidia (NVDA, $497)', 'Alphabet (GOOGL, $134)', 'Cadence Design Systems (CDNS, $273)', 'Palantir\xa0Technologies (PLTR, $20)', 'Procter & Gamble (PG, $152)', 'Johnson &\xa0Johnson (JNJ, $148)', 'Arch Capital Group (ACGL, $86)', 'Exxon Mobil (XOM, $104)', 'Kinder Morgan (KMI, $17)', 'MercadoLibre (MELI, $1,431)', 'Hermès (HESAY, $208)', 'Boston\xa0Properties (BXP, $57)', 'Prices as of 11/14/23', 'In a year when stock markets treaded water, Fortune’s picks swam a bit faster. Our “11 recession-resistant stocks to buy for 2023” delivered a median return of 7.9% over the past 12 months, about half a percentage point better than the S&P 500. Here’s what worked and what didn’t.\xa0—Matt Heimer', 'Thanks, ChatGPT!Our top performer was Microsoft, returning 41%. Excitement about generative AI was a huge tailwind: Microsoft is the main investor in and partner of OpenAI, the maker\xa0of chatbot ChatGPT. Its Azure cloud and Copilot productivity tools, both of which are AI-powered, enjoyed huge revenue gains. We’re betting the ride continues.', 'Paying dividendsDividend payouts helped some picks post impressive numbers. Investors in retailer TJX (up 14%) and waste management firm Republic Services (up 12.5%) got a meaningful boost from dividends. And Procter & Gamble (up 8%) trailed the broader market on share price appreciation—but beat the S&P\xa0500 overall thanks to its hefty yield.', 'Spoiled foodTwo food-related picks gave us indigestion. Inflation squeezed food distributor Sysco, by increasing its costs and hurting business for its restaurant customers; its shares lost 20%. Similar forces hurt Philippines-based food and beverage company Universal Robina (down 14%). Still, both companies stayed profitable and paid big dividends.', 'A version of this article appears in the December 2023/January 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, ""13 stocks to buy for 2024.""', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

But as the year rolled on stocks remained strong amid AI-fueled rally and strong consumer spending that also helped companies’ third quarter performance. But many analysts are now warning that the recession that was expected in 2023 could now come in 2024. Mohamed El-Erian, a famous Egyptian-American economists who is also the former CEO of PIMCO, recently gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he talked about his rationale behind his worries regarding a 2024 recession. The economist said:', ""For the last year when people were saying we are going into recession in 2023, I pushed back. I kept on saying there's no reason we're going into recession. This economy is inherently strong. Balance sheets are robust. Now, I must say I'm more worried about 2024. And I'm more worried about 2024 for three reasons. One is the lagged effect of these massive increases in interest rates. They act with a lag. Second is that people's savings have been run down.

Everyone can kind of go. ""Napoleon"" is rated R. It\'s a historical biopic. It\'s a more narrow audience.', ""But over the three-day period, you talk about over $20 million. And it's a very expensive film. I have to say I saw the film. It's OK. It's a pretty good film. If you're a history buff, you'll probably like it more than anyone else. But, you know, Ridley Scott at age 84, 85, he's still got it. I mean, he really made this film very well."", ""The battle scenes are there. But also the acting he gets out of his actors is quite good as well. This is a film that's made to make most of its money overseas.

Do you think that was a big part of what we\'re seeing in the numbers?', ""GITESH PANDYA: It was definitely a component. I mean, we all know people love their celebrities.

These movies opening over Thanksgiving did have their actors, at least in the last two weeks or so, promoting their films. And these are the results. So the actors can only go so far in promoting it. When people don't feel the excitement for something and they're asked to pay a record high ticket price for these movies, they're going to decide whether to skip it or not."", ""And films come out on streaming faster than ever.

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.', 'Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Exelon shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Exelon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none has revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 51 cents per share to 58 cents in that period.', 'Given the way analysts feel Exelon right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.', 'Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

But as the year rolled on stocks remained strong amid AI-fueled rally and strong consumer spending that also helped companies’ third quarter performance. But many analysts are now warning that the recession that was expected in 2023 could now come in 2024. Mohamed El-Erian, a famous Egyptian-American economists who is also the former CEO of PIMCO, recently gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he talked about his rationale behind his worries regarding a 2024 recession. The economist said:', ""For the last year when people were saying we are going into recession in 2023, I pushed back. I kept on saying there's no reason we're going into recession. This economy is inherently strong. Balance sheets are robust. Now, I must say I'm more worried about 2024. And I'm more worried about 2024 for three reasons. One is the lagged effect of these massive increases in interest rates. They act with a lag. Second is that people's savings have been run down. And thirdly, the international context has become even more uncertain."", 'In this backdrop, it makes sense to take a look at what famous US politicians are up to when it comes to stock trades.

While the graphics, user interface and general gameplay currently appeal more to younger people, Roblox is pursuing a strategy of investing heavily to accelerate its technological capabilities so that it can provide experiences that appeal to an older demographic.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the real estate industry, head directly to 5 Best REIT Stocks To Buy Right Now.', 'Global markets are facing a dilemma caused by significantly higher borrowing expenses, which seem likely to remain high, alongside a scarcity of homes leading to inflated property prices. This situation has resulted in increasing housing affordability issues in many regions. Property owners with loans subject to readjustment are experiencing growing financial pressure. In the US, where 30-year mortgages are common, the housing market is at a standstill. People with low-rate mortgages are hesitant to sell, and buyers are finding it difficult to make purchases. Similarly, as per Bloomberg, house values have not dropped much in places like New Zealand and Canada, leaving some buyers who paid high prices struggling with larger loan payments. Landlords in different countries, from the UK to South Korea, are also facing challenges. Higher interest rates are making it harder to build new properties in several locations.\xa0', 'Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, anticipates that US 30-year mortgage rates, currently around 7.4%, will likely average about 5.5% over the next decade, compared to the low of 2.65% in early 2021. He predicts a similar increase in most other developed countries, although the specific levels may differ. He said:', '“The golden age of single-family housing is behind us. If you bought in the wake of the financial crisis, you built up a lot of equity in most parts of the world, but the next 10 years is going to be more of a slog.”', 'Last year, the real estate industry aimed to weather risks and set up for a period of lasting growth and better returns. However, this year, industry leaders interviewed by PwC are confronting a new reality. They no longer anticipate a complete return to pre-pandemic norms. Instead, they are acknowledging that many individuals may not return to the office as frequently or at all. This shift poses implications not just for office owners, managers, and brokers but also for downtown areas and other property sectors reliant on a strong office market. Moreover, there is a prevailing acceptance in the industry that interest rates will likely remain elevated for at least the upcoming year, or potentially longer. Even positive news, like increased investor interest in acquiring new assets, is overshadowed by disappointing sector statistics. For instance, despite available funding, real estate transactions have decreased. Many attribute this decline to disagreements between buyers and sellers over pricing due to limited sales, hindering price clarity. However, amidst these challenges, respondents in PwC’s ‘Emerging Trends’ survey anticipate that the worst of inflation might be in the past, possibly giving the Federal Reserve cause to stop interest rate hikes.', 'On October 7, in an interview with Fox Business, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman responded to the state of the U.S. real estate market, cautioning prospective homebuyers that any relief from the extremely challenging economic conditions might not be guaranteed in 2024. He stated:', '""You\'ll have to ask the Fed when the market\'s going to get better, because it seems very unlikely that interest rates will ease by the end of this year. So, the only real question is whether we\'re going to catch a break entering the home buying season of 2024. But I think most people have written off the 2023 home buying season.""', ""Despite ongoing concerns, global economies are holding up reasonably well, showing some clearer areas amid persistent uncertainties, according to Deloitte. Heading into 2024, the global economy faces multiple challenges. Yet, early responses to banking troubles in 2023, strong consumer demand, and steady energy and food prices have provided some stability. The global real estate industry sees an opportunity to strengthen its foundations in 2024. Different factors, such as changes in work patterns due to pandemic recovery and recent uncertainties in global affairs and financial markets, make the year ahead crucial for real estate firms. With mixed signals about the industry's health, real estate leaders may need to navigate uncertainties while reshaping future ownership and investment strategies.

The company also estimates that it will reach 5.8 billion packages by the end of the year, outpacing its total deliveries compared to last year by 600 million.', 'Scott Devitt, Wedbush Managing Director, Equity Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss why Amazon has continued to become a dominant force in the delivery business.', '""The way that the market share has changed is that more merchandise that\'s retail-oriented that\'s coming out of Amazon fulfillment centers is making up in the incremental market share gains that Amazon is getting from the other two providers and Amazon\'s not in the business of picking up packages and delivering, which I think is market share that\'s probably safe for UPS and FedEx because it rates the retail,"" Devitt explains.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Also, of course, related as we watch all these numbers on this Cyber Monday, Amazon, the new king of the parcel delivery giants, knocking UPS and FedEx out of the running. That's according to company documents seen by the Wall Street Journal. The e-commerce giant had already delivered 4.8 billion packages by Thanksgiving this year, and projects it will do another billion by year end."", ""Here with more on this is Scott Devitt, Equity Research Managing Director at Wedbush. Scott, it's great to see you. I hope you had a great holiday and that you're doing a lot of buying right now. You know, I'm so curious about this sort of battle, if you will, for package volume. It's something that UPS and FedEx seem to have stepped back on, at least the volume race. Is winning winning in this case? In other words, is it better for Amazon to be doing all this volume itself?"", ""SCOTT DEVITT: Well, happy holidays. And it's always easy for a competitor that's losing to say that they're not going after market share, so that's somewhat comical. But what's happened over the past many years has been that Amazon's taken share of delivery because it's providing packages delivered from itself and also the very large network of merchants that are on its marketplace."", ""And so where Amazon's taking significant shares, they're taking volume away from UPS and FedEx that would have been delivered by either of those companies under scenarios at which those merchants actually weren't selling on the Amazon Marketplace. And the way that Amazon's been able to do that is because they've increased their own last mile delivery, so they have a full logistics capability within the business."", ""So, the way that the market share has changed is that more merchandise that's retail oriented that's coming out of Amazon fulfillment centers is making up the incremental market share gains that Amazon's getting from the other two providers. And Amazon's not in the business of picking up packages and delivering, which I think is market share that's probably safe for UPS and FedEx, but as it rates the retail, you know, Amazon's built a better mousetrap."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And, Scott, for Amazon investors who are listening to this right now, why should they care, Scott? Why should they pay attention to this headline?', ""SCOTT DEVITT: Well, what's part of the mode of Amazon is the logistics capability that the company has. It's differentiated relative to other retailers, and it's part of what allows the company to gain and grow market share. And so the relevance of it is it's incredibly expensive to build the network that Amazon has, but now that it's in place, it's unmatched, unparalleled, and unable to be replaced by any competition."", 'So, the benefit that Amazon has is the experience they provide to the customer, which is why consumers go to amazon.com. And because of that, that brings third party merchants onto the marketplace, and Amazon can deliver products faster than any other provider, which is exactly what a consumer prefers on the internet.', ""And one other data point that I provide is now-- as Amazon has increased the regional aspects of its business in the United States post-pandemic. Now, in the largest 60 metro markets, over 50% of the packages are being delivered same day or next day, which is going to further the advantage this holiday season with the holiday being on a Monday. And just in general, as well, taking share of consumer products categories that are more near-term in nature in terms of the consumer's preference to pick them up at a Walgreens or et cetera.""]"

Based on two outside estimates, UPS’ 2024 changes will add the equivalent of 2.75 million to nearly 3 million Americans to the DAS list, even though the carrier plans to remove more ZIP codes than it will add.', 'The estimates from consultancies Shippingwise and Shipware LLC were based on UPS’ (NYSE: UPS) internal data and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. According to Shippingwise, the UPS changes will add the equivalent of about 2.9 million people to the DAS rolls, while 15,000 would be removed. Shipware’s estimates weren’t much different, with the equal of 2.73 million people being added and 15,873 people being removed.', 'The estimates indicate that the ZIP codes being added for 2024 cover a much larger population compared to the ZIP codes being removed, said Matt Sumowski, senior manager of client success at Shipware.', 'This means, in theory and likely in practice, that UPS merchants will have to pay a per-package delivery area fee for more of their transactions. UPS said in a statement that its surcharges provide “appropriate compensation” for additional costs that it bears.', 'FedEx (NYSE: FDX) has not made its 2024 data available to analysts, though the consultancies said that it’s a safe bet that it will make similar changes. Nicholas Fanelli, founder of Shippingwise, has estimated that the 2024 changes at both carriers will result in 29% of the U.S. population that will be covered by a DAS.', 'A DAS is divided into three categories. The first is a standard surcharge. A second is an “extended” area surcharge and a third, which applies to deliveries to specific ZIP codes within Alaska and Hawaii, is known as a “remote” area surcharge. Standard surcharges generally apply to relatively close-in suburban areas where the cost to serve isn’t as burdensome for the carriers. Extended area surcharges, which run higher than standard levies, cover regions that lack the delivery density of suburban neighborhoods and where the travel costs are higher. Remote area surcharges to less-acceptable delivery areas run still higher. Commercial surcharges are lower than residential levies.', 'DASes traditionally cover destination locations and are not applied at a delivery’s origin point. However, a returned item picked up at a DAS-eligible ZIP code would be charged a levy, according to Fanelli.', 'FedEx and UPS’ DAS tables are effectively the same. For example, in 2024 both will levy a $5.85 charge on each eligible residential delivery made by air. In addition, each will impose a $5.70 fee for eligible ground residential deliveries. For deliveries covered by an extended DAS, a $7.70 charge will be applied by both carriers. Each will raise their respective DAS’ in 2024 by between 25 cents to $2.50 per package, depending on the service.', 'Fanelli estimates that DAS accounts for about 20% of a shipper’s average total surcharge levy.', 'OnTrac, the largest regional carrier that has expanded into what has become a transcontinental network, applies a DAS. So does LSO, which operates across seven Southern states including all of Texas. The U.S. Postal Service does not levy a surcharge. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which recently launched a stand-alone parcel delivery service known as Amazon Shipping, levies a $3.70 per package on all eligible shipments.', 'DAS, like the other and myriad delivery surcharges imposed by the national carriers, are designed to offset their higher costs to serve. In the case of the extended and remote area surcharges, the carriers do incur higher than normal costs. However, in more high-density suburban areas where the carriers have well-established routes, the per-package cost is significantly lower, according to Fanelli, who said in the latter scenario, a higher portion of those levies will flow to the bottom line.', 'Sumowski of Shipware said the ZIP code shifts are an “example of how the carriers hide additional increases separate from the increase in surcharge dollar amount. The overall impact comes from the change in the rate itself, but also from the frequency with which the charge will apply.” DAS, like other surcharges such as fuel, apply to a broad range of the carriers’ services. Fanelli added that many shippers might not even notice the ZIP code changes and their potential impact on their shipping budgets.', 'It is also a way for the carriers to boost their top and bottom lines within a multiyear contract period, and especially during a cycle of carrier overcapacity and slow demand.', 'Still, a DAS can be negotiated down (though likely not out) depending on a shipper’s volume and how much density it adds to a carrier’s network. Brian C. Gibbs, president of Refund Retriever LLC, a shipment auditing firm, said in a website post earlier this year that a 25% to 50% discount off of a shipper’s published rates “is an excellent goal.”', 'Gibbs advised shippers to review the charges being assessed before asking for the concession and said one question that a shipper should ask is how many packages are slapped with a DAS.', 'Despite that, many merchants tend to accept these changes each year, and absorb any additional cost if they offer free shipping, Gibbs said.', 'Fanelli echoed those sentiments, saying that although they may want to pass on the DAS, they won’t risk alienating their customers to do so.', '(Note: An earlier version said that Amazon Shipping does not impose DAS. Though Amazon Shipping states that it does not impose delivery surcharges, a notice in its terms and conditions shows that. it does. The story’s updated version also includes comments from UPS).', 'The post More parcel shippers likely to get caught in delivery surcharge net appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

But as the year rolled on stocks remained strong amid AI-fueled rally and strong consumer spending that also helped companies’ third quarter performance. But many analysts are now warning that the recession that was expected in 2023 could now come in 2024. Mohamed El-Erian, a famous Egyptian-American economists who is also the former CEO of PIMCO, recently gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he talked about his rationale behind his worries regarding a 2024 recession. The economist said:', ""For the last year when people were saying we are going into recession in 2023, I pushed back. I kept on saying there's no reason we're going into recession. This economy is inherently strong. Balance sheets are robust. Now, I must say I'm more worried about 2024. And I'm more worried about 2024 for three reasons. One is the lagged effect of these massive increases in interest rates. They act with a lag. Second is that people's savings have been run down. And thirdly, the international context has become even more uncertain."", 'In this backdrop, it makes sense to take a look at what famous US politicians are up to when it comes to stock trades.

While the graphics, user interface and general gameplay currently appeal more to younger people, Roblox is pursuing a strategy of investing heavily to accelerate its technological capabilities so that it can provide experiences that appeal to an older demographic. We believe the valuation is justifiable given the stickiness of the core platform (the average user spends 2.4 hours per day on Roblox), its attractive business model and a potential bull case where Roblox becomes a leading place to create and consume social 3D experiences for the general population.', 'Roblox is another (there are more) example of a company that is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI advancements.

If you want to skip our overview of investing and some recent financial news, then take a look at 5 Best Stocks to But for Good Returns. ', 'Investing in the stock market comes in flavors. For those chasing short term profit, different derivative instruments allow investors to bet on short term share price movements and minimize their potential losses. For the folks looking to slowly grow their assets over time, the best approach is long term investing. This involves carefully sifting out stocks based on strong fundamentals, buying them, and then waiting for years for the price to slowly appreciate.', ""One of the strongest adherents of long term investing is Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett has the biggest investment portfolio in the world, with Insider Monkey's research showing that as of Q3 2023 end, he held stakes worth $313 billion in a variety of different companies. For several of these, Mr. Buffett has owned the shares for more than a decade, primarily in dividend paying companies that allow him to reinvest the dividends back into the shares for an effort free approach to building wealth."", ""Another key pillar of Mr. Buffett's investment strategy is to generate double digit percentage returns that range between 20% and 30%. Insider Monkey has researched every decade of his financial journey from the mid 1900s to discover interesting facts. Mr. Buffett started his financial career in 1956, with a mere $105,100 in capital (worth roughly $1.1 million today). Back then, his business model was simple: Invest with Warren Buffett and you get to keep all of your returns below 6% and 75% of the returns in excess of that. His firm's foundational year would actually lag the S&P 500 in terms of percentage returns, and Mr. Buffett's first big hurrah would come next year when even though the index was down by 10.8%, Berkshire posted 10.4% returns and marked the first true achievement for an investor that would end up defining market dynamics later in his career."", ""The now well known Oracle of Omaha would then start a decade of outperforming the S&P 500 and end up defining his investment career. Over the next ten years,\xa0 i.e. between 1957 and 1966, Berkshire would return 23.5% annually after Mr. Buffett's 5.5% annual fee cut. This smashed the S&P 500 out of the park, as the flagship index's average annual compounded rate was 9.2% during the same time period. To put things into perspective, $10,000 entrusted to Warren Buffett in 1957 would have been worth a cool $64,100 after fees."", ""These days, Warren Buffett has kept up with the times. His investment portfolio is one of the most interesting ones that we've analyzed among dozens of other big ticket finance and investment players. While most hedge funds would balk at putting most of their money into a single stock since this goes against the investment principle of portfolio diversification, Warren Buffet, naturally, does not think like anyone else. Out of the $313 billion that he has exclusively plowed into publicly traded stocks, $156 billion is in the stock of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). An additional $90 billion is in the shares of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Warren Buffett picks his stocks carefully, and once he does, he holds on to them for dear life with few adjustments down the road."", 'Consider Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks. Three of his longest held stocks are Coca-Cola, American Express, and Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). While Mr. Buffett has tinkered with some of these companies before piling into them and waiting, his first major investments in the trio came in 1998, 1991, and 2000. Fast forwarding to today, this means that you would have to buy some new hot and upcoming companies and then wait until at least 2044 to have held them as long as Warren Buffett has.', ""Interestingly, American Express was also a key reason that Buffett was able to outperform the S&P 500 in the time periods we've shared above. He explained his journey in a 1968 shareholder letter where he outlined:"", 'Last year I referred to one investment which substantially outperformed the general market in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and because of its size (the largest proportion we have ever had in anything – we hit our 40% limit) had a very material impact on our overall results and, even more so, this category.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on NetApp is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.18 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$9.3b - US$3.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).', ""So, NetApp has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Tech industry average of 7.4% it's much better."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NetApp ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for NetApp compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NetApp here  for free."", ""Things have been pretty stable at NetApp, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at NetApp in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why NetApp is paying out 34% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""In a nutshell, NetApp has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And with the stock having returned a mere 30% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere."", ""One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with NetApp (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful."", ""While NetApp isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Scientists have said carbon removal is needed to keep climate goals alive."", 'That approach has the backing of global producers seeking to continue profiting from fossil fuels, but draws skepticism among environmentalists and some governments who see it as a ploy to prolong the lifespan of oil and gas and who are pushing for tough language at COP28 to phase out fossil fuels completely.', 'Underscoring the rift, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week that the oil and gas industry is over-relying on carbon capture to reduce emissions and called the approach ""an illusion,"" sparking an angry response from OPEC which views the technology as a lifeline for future fossil fuel use.', '“We think that no amount of direct air capture as an industry should be used as any justification for prolonging of expanded fossil fuel production,” said Vikrum Aiyer, head of climate policy at Heirloom, which is a partner in the Louisiana facility called', 'Project Cypress.', 'The differing approaches also reflect an important financial dynamic in the carbon removal industry: In the near term, it is a lot easier to make money trapping carbon if it comes with a perk like higher oil production.', 'Otherwise, the enormous price tag for world-scale carbon removal would need to fall to governments if there is any chance of these projects surviving.', 'SAVIOR OR FIG LEAF?', 'The IEA says DAC would have to capture as much as 1 billion tonnes annually by 2050 if the world is to hit its decarbonization targets, a massive scale-up from the 10,000 tonnes it removes currently.', 'A major concern is that DAC technology is both expensive and unproven at scale.

For several of these, Mr. Buffett has owned the shares for more than a decade, primarily in dividend paying companies that allow him to reinvest the dividends back into the shares for an effort free approach to building wealth."", ""Another key pillar of Mr. Buffett's investment strategy is to generate double digit percentage returns that range between 20% and 30%. Insider Monkey has researched every decade of his financial journey from the mid 1900s to discover interesting facts. Mr. Buffett started his financial career in 1956, with a mere $105,100 in capital (worth roughly $1.1 million today). Back then, his business model was simple: Invest with Warren Buffett and you get to keep all of your returns below 6% and 75% of the returns in excess of that. His firm's foundational year would actually lag the S&P 500 in terms of percentage returns, and Mr. Buffett's first big hurrah would come next year when even though the index was down by 10.8%, Berkshire posted 10.4% returns and marked the first true achievement for an investor that would end up defining market dynamics later in his career."", ""The now well known Oracle of Omaha would then start a decade of outperforming the S&P 500 and end up defining his investment career. Over the next ten years,\xa0 i.e. between 1957 and 1966, Berkshire would return 23.5% annually after Mr. Buffett's 5.5% annual fee cut. This smashed the S&P 500 out of the park, as the flagship index's average annual compounded rate was 9.2% during the same time period. To put things into perspective, $10,000 entrusted to Warren Buffett in 1957 would have been worth a cool $64,100 after fees."", ""These days, Warren Buffett has kept up with the times. His investment portfolio is one of the most interesting ones that we've analyzed among dozens of other big ticket finance and investment players. While most hedge funds would balk at putting most of their money into a single stock since this goes against the investment principle of portfolio diversification, Warren Buffet, naturally, does not think like anyone else. Out of the $313 billion that he has exclusively plowed into publicly traded stocks, $156 billion is in the stock of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). An additional $90 billion is in the shares of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Warren Buffett picks his stocks carefully, and once he does, he holds on to them for dear life with few adjustments down the road."", 'Consider Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks. Three of his longest held stocks are Coca-Cola, American Express, and Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). While Mr. Buffett has tinkered with some of these companies before piling into them and waiting, his first major investments in the trio came in 1998, 1991, and 2000. Fast forwarding to today, this means that you would have to buy some new hot and upcoming companies and then wait until at least 2044 to have held them as long as Warren Buffett has.', ""Interestingly, American Express was also a key reason that Buffett was able to outperform the S&P 500 in the time periods we've shared above. He explained his journey in a 1968 shareholder letter where he outlined:"", 'Last year I referred to one investment which substantially outperformed the general market in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and because of its size (the largest proportion we have ever had in anything – we hit our 40% limit) had a very material impact on our overall results and, even more so, this category. This excellent performance continued throughout 1967 and a large portion of total gain was again accounted for by this single security. Our holdings of this security have been very substantially reduced and we have nothing in this group remotely approaching the size or potential which formerly existed in this investment.', ""So, today we'll look at some good stocks to buy for solid returns and the top three picks are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc.

If you want to skip our introduction to the most successful investor of our age and recent stock market indicators, then take a look at the 5 Cheap Value Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett. ', 'Warren Buffett is one of the richest people in the world, and the only finance professional who is part of the coveted centi-billionaire club. Billionaires with a net worth greater than $100 billion are typically industry tycoons who have amassed their wealth by building big businesses that target fashion, technology, electric vehicles, social media, retail, or other lucrative industries.', ""On the flip side, the finance and investing world is typically dominated by either big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), or hedge funds such as Ken Fisher's Fisher Investments or Ken Griffin's Citadel Group. Since big banks were formed years ago, their founders are now dead and therefore cannot benefit from a centi-billionaire status through their shareholdings. Similarly, while big hedge fund bosses see their firms rake in billions of dollars each year, their profits cannot scale to the level of say Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the structure of most hedge funds, even those that are publicly traded, prevents behemoth valuations to make their owners ultra, ultra rich. If you're interested in knowing how much money hedge funds make, you can check out 20 Highest Paid Hedge Fund Managers of All Time."", 'Warren Buffet, therefore, is an outlier. This is because his firm, Berkshire Hathaway, is not structured like a hedge fund. Instead, Berkshire is an investment holding company that dabbles in both public and private businesses. Its investment strategy, which sees Berkshire either outright buy most businesses or selectively take large stakes in mostly dividend paying firms, allows its revenue to match big tech giants more instead of hedge funds. This is because by buying businesses, Berkshire is entitled to a slice of their profits, and no matter how many big bets Ken Griffin makes on the stock market, revenue from a well oiled large business like the ones Mr. Buffett invests in is likely to surpass a hedge funds income from fund fee and returns.', ""Digging deeper, Berkshire's income statement for the third quarter of this year shows that during the quarter, the firm raked in a cool $93.2 billion in revenue. Within these sales figures, a mere $4 billion came from interest, dividends, and other financial activities. Instead, the majority of Berkshire Hathaway's third quarter revenue came from its insurance business and its freight, utility, and energy operations."", ""Yet, despite the fact that Mr. Buffett's firm earns most of its money through business activities rather than making trades like hedge funds, he is still thought to be the greatest investor of our time. Considering this, one might wonder, what makes Warren Buffett the Oracle of Omaha? The answer is quite simple really. Mr. Buffet has somehow nearly perfected the art of picking out a select few companies that are able to post remarkable share price growth and pay dividends out of the thousands that trade on the stock market. To see how the Oracle thinks differently, consider the shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Warren Buffett bought the shares in 1998, and what else was happening back then? It was the dot com era when most people were buying attractive technology stocks. But the Oracle was buying the shares of a sugary beverage firm, and while the bubble popped, Mr. Buffett became one of the richest people in the world."", ""At the heart of his investing approach is what is dubbed Value Investing. Simply put, this involves an investor determining the fair value of a stock and then comparing it to the market price to see if it's higher. If it is, then a buying decision is made based on the potential of the share price falling. Since the fair value of these stocks is higher than the market value, they often have low P/E ratios as well."", ""Today, we'll take a look at some cheap value stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett.

T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.', 'This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition.

If you want to skip our overview of Mr. Buffet and how value investing is an integral part of his financial journey then take a look at 5 Best Value Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett. ', ""For most people, investing often appears to be a black box. This was even truer before the current computing era that has placed copious amounts of financial and non financial information at everyone's fingertips. Buying a stock came with a variety of risks, and to mitigate these, a deeper understanding of the fundamentals was needed to avoid hefty losses. After all, there is no stop gap to a share price which can rapidly drop and erase all principal in the blink of an eye."", ""Yet, the finance industry is among the few that can truly transform an individual from rags to riches. The American Dream, for most parts, revolves around a stable source of income and a house - and as alluring and indispensable as this is, it is unlikely to make most people into overnight millionaires. With the financial sector, a couple of bets can transform anyone's life in ways previously thought unimaginable."", ""One of the biggest ways through which anyone can profit from the stock market is through share price appreciation. Just like there is no downward stop gap to how low stock can go, there's no upper bar, either. For instance, consider two stocks that everyone knows, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Meta's shares have more than doubled this year, as they opened 2023 at $124 and are now currently trading at $341. For the average retail investor with a total savings of $2,000, even if half of these had been invested into Meta at the start of 2023, it would have doubled for a generous return. For the more established folks, investing $10,000 in the shares would definitely have made investing worth its while. Similarly, NVIDIA's shares have more than tripled this year, so our hypothetical retail investor could have made more money than their savings by simply investing half of the savings in a single stock."", ""At the heart of making money through share price appreciation is an approach called value investing. For the uninitiated, it involves determining the fair value of a stock and then checking the market price to see whether it's lower or higher. If the market price is lower, then a buying decision is made based on a metric called the margin of safety. Since a value investing decision bases its buying decision on the assumption that the market value will match the fair value at some point in the future, the lower the market price, the higher the margin of safety is."", ""Warren Buffett is one of the strictest adherents of value investing, as is evident by his firm's investment portfolio. When compared to most of the hotshot hedge funds in the market, Berkshire Hathaway buys shares and then forgets about them - most of the time. Its most successful stock picks have delivered spectacular returns simply through long term share price appreciation. For instance, we took a look at Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks and discovered that his three longest held shares are those of Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), and his first major purchases were more than two decades back - or when most of Gen Z wasn't born. Now, Berkshire's investment portfolio is worth $313 billion and Mr. Buffett is a centi-billionaire, in a simple and effective demonstration of the potential of value investing."", ""Today, we'll look at some of Warren Buffett's top value stock picks and some notable names are T-Mobile US, Inc.

Their CFO talked about that and that their third quarter operating margin would be more pressured than what it saw in the second quarter."", ""So you know, one of the things they're dealing with is also pricing pressure, right?

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) share price is up 90% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 56% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 11%."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement."", ""During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 39% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", 'Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals shareholders are up 11% for the year. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 14% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. Before forming an opinion on Vertex Pharmaceuticals you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

If you want to skip our introduction to the most successful investor of our age and recent stock market indicators, then take a look at the 5 Cheap Value Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett. ', 'Warren Buffett is one of the richest people in the world, and the only finance professional who is part of the coveted centi-billionaire club. Billionaires with a net worth greater than $100 billion are typically industry tycoons who have amassed their wealth by building big businesses that target fashion, technology, electric vehicles, social media, retail, or other lucrative industries.', ""On the flip side, the finance and investing world is typically dominated by either big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), or hedge funds such as Ken Fisher's Fisher Investments or Ken Griffin's Citadel Group. Since big banks were formed years ago, their founders are now dead and therefore cannot benefit from a centi-billionaire status through their shareholdings. Similarly, while big hedge fund bosses see their firms rake in billions of dollars each year, their profits cannot scale to the level of say Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the structure of most hedge funds, even those that are publicly traded, prevents behemoth valuations to make their owners ultra, ultra rich. If you're interested in knowing how much money hedge funds make, you can check out 20 Highest Paid Hedge Fund Managers of All Time."", 'Warren Buffet, therefore, is an outlier. This is because his firm, Berkshire Hathaway, is not structured like a hedge fund. Instead, Berkshire is an investment holding company that dabbles in both public and private businesses. Its investment strategy, which sees Berkshire either outright buy most businesses or selectively take large stakes in mostly dividend paying firms, allows its revenue to match big tech giants more instead of hedge funds. This is because by buying businesses, Berkshire is entitled to a slice of their profits, and no matter how many big bets Ken Griffin makes on the stock market, revenue from a well oiled large business like the ones Mr. Buffett invests in is likely to surpass a hedge funds income from fund fee and returns.', ""Digging deeper, Berkshire's income statement for the third quarter of this year shows that during the quarter, the firm raked in a cool $93.2 billion in revenue. Within these sales figures, a mere $4 billion came from interest, dividends, and other financial activities. Instead, the majority of Berkshire Hathaway's third quarter revenue came from its insurance business and its freight, utility, and energy operations."", ""Yet, despite the fact that Mr. Buffett's firm earns most of its money through business activities rather than making trades like hedge funds, he is still thought to be the greatest investor of our time. Considering this, one might wonder, what makes Warren Buffett the Oracle of Omaha? The answer is quite simple really. Mr. Buffet has somehow nearly perfected the art of picking out a select few companies that are able to post remarkable share price growth and pay dividends out of the thousands that trade on the stock market. To see how the Oracle thinks differently, consider the shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Warren Buffett bought the shares in 1998, and what else was happening back then? It was the dot com era when most people were buying attractive technology stocks. But the Oracle was buying the shares of a sugary beverage firm, and while the bubble popped, Mr. Buffett became one of the richest people in the world."", ""At the heart of his investing approach is what is dubbed Value Investing. Simply put, this involves an investor determining the fair value of a stock and then comparing it to the market price to see if it's higher. If it is, then a buying decision is made based on the potential of the share price falling. Since the fair value of these stocks is higher than the market value, they often have low P/E ratios as well."", ""Today, we'll take a look at some cheap value stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett.

Cramer is 68 years-old, is a former hedge fund manager like Soros, and has close to four decades of experience in the world of stocks. Both investors recommend equities as one of the best investment vehicles for the average person.\xa0', 'Soros became famous by shorting the British pound in 1992, a bet that earned him over $1 billion in profits. Cramer earned a name for himself by averaging returns of more than 24% over a fourteen year period at his hedge fund, making more than $10 million in profits each year.

If you want to skip our overview of investing and some recent financial news, then take a look at 5 Best Stocks to But for Good Returns. ', 'Investing in the stock market comes in flavors. For those chasing short term profit, different derivative instruments allow investors to bet on short term share price movements and minimize their potential losses. For the folks looking to slowly grow their assets over time, the best approach is long term investing. This involves carefully sifting out stocks based on strong fundamentals, buying them, and then waiting for years for the price to slowly appreciate.', ""One of the strongest adherents of long term investing is Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett has the biggest investment portfolio in the world, with Insider Monkey's research showing that as of Q3 2023 end, he held stakes worth $313 billion in a variety of different companies. For several of these, Mr. Buffett has owned the shares for more than a decade, primarily in dividend paying companies that allow him to reinvest the dividends back into the shares for an effort free approach to building wealth."", ""Another key pillar of Mr. Buffett's investment strategy is to generate double digit percentage returns that range between 20% and 30%. Insider Monkey has researched every decade of his financial journey from the mid 1900s to discover interesting facts. Mr. Buffett started his financial career in 1956, with a mere $105,100 in capital (worth roughly $1.1 million today). Back then, his business model was simple: Invest with Warren Buffett and you get to keep all of your returns below 6% and 75% of the returns in excess of that. His firm's foundational year would actually lag the S&P 500 in terms of percentage returns, and Mr. Buffett's first big hurrah would come next year when even though the index was down by 10.8%, Berkshire posted 10.4% returns and marked the first true achievement for an investor that would end up defining market dynamics later in his career."", ""The now well known Oracle of Omaha would then start a decade of outperforming the S&P 500 and end up defining his investment career. Over the next ten years,\xa0 i.e. between 1957 and 1966, Berkshire would return 23.5% annually after Mr. Buffett's 5.5% annual fee cut. This smashed the S&P 500 out of the park, as the flagship index's average annual compounded rate was 9.2% during the same time period. To put things into perspective, $10,000 entrusted to Warren Buffett in 1957 would have been worth a cool $64,100 after fees."", ""These days, Warren Buffett has kept up with the times. His investment portfolio is one of the most interesting ones that we've analyzed among dozens of other big ticket finance and investment players. While most hedge funds would balk at putting most of their money into a single stock since this goes against the investment principle of portfolio diversification, Warren Buffet, naturally, does not think like anyone else. Out of the $313 billion that he has exclusively plowed into publicly traded stocks, $156 billion is in the stock of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). An additional $90 billion is in the shares of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Warren Buffett picks his stocks carefully, and once he does, he holds on to them for dear life with few adjustments down the road."", 'Consider Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks. Three of his longest held stocks are Coca-Cola, American Express, and Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). While Mr. Buffett has tinkered with some of these companies before piling into them and waiting, his first major investments in the trio came in 1998, 1991, and 2000. Fast forwarding to today, this means that you would have to buy some new hot and upcoming companies and then wait until at least 2044 to have held them as long as Warren Buffett has.', ""Interestingly, American Express was also a key reason that Buffett was able to outperform the S&P 500 in the time periods we've shared above. He explained his journey in a 1968 shareholder letter where he outlined:"", 'Last year I referred to one investment which substantially outperformed the general market in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and because of its size (the largest proportion we have ever had in anything – we hit our 40% limit) had a very material impact on our overall results and, even more so, this category. This excellent performance continued throughout 1967 and a large portion of total gain was again accounted for by this single security.

If you want to skip our overview of investing and some recent financial news, then take a look at 5 Best Stocks to But for Good Returns. ', 'Investing in the stock market comes in flavors. For those chasing short term profit, different derivative instruments allow investors to bet on short term share price movements and minimize their potential losses. For the folks looking to slowly grow their assets over time, the best approach is long term investing. This involves carefully sifting out stocks based on strong fundamentals, buying them, and then waiting for years for the price to slowly appreciate.', ""One of the strongest adherents of long term investing is Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett has the biggest investment portfolio in the world, with Insider Monkey's research showing that as of Q3 2023 end, he held stakes worth $313 billion in a variety of different companies. For several of these, Mr. Buffett has owned the shares for more than a decade, primarily in dividend paying companies that allow him to reinvest the dividends back into the shares for an effort free approach to building wealth."", ""Another key pillar of Mr. Buffett's investment strategy is to generate double digit percentage returns that range between 20% and 30%. Insider Monkey has researched every decade of his financial journey from the mid 1900s to discover interesting facts. Mr. Buffett started his financial career in 1956, with a mere $105,100 in capital (worth roughly $1.1 million today). Back then, his business model was simple: Invest with Warren Buffett and you get to keep all of your returns below 6% and 75% of the returns in excess of that. His firm's foundational year would actually lag the S&P 500 in terms of percentage returns, and Mr. Buffett's first big hurrah would come next year when even though the index was down by 10.8%, Berkshire posted 10.4% returns and marked the first true achievement for an investor that would end up defining market dynamics later in his career."", ""The now well known Oracle of Omaha would then start a decade of outperforming the S&P 500 and end up defining his investment career. Over the next ten years,\xa0 i.e. between 1957 and 1966, Berkshire would return 23.5% annually after Mr. Buffett's 5.5% annual fee cut. This smashed the S&P 500 out of the park, as the flagship index's average annual compounded rate was 9.2% during the same time period. To put things into perspective, $10,000 entrusted to Warren Buffett in 1957 would have been worth a cool $64,100 after fees."", ""These days, Warren Buffett has kept up with the times. His investment portfolio is one of the most interesting ones that we've analyzed among dozens of other big ticket finance and investment players. While most hedge funds would balk at putting most of their money into a single stock since this goes against the investment principle of portfolio diversification, Warren Buffet, naturally, does not think like anyone else. Out of the $313 billion that he has exclusively plowed into publicly traded stocks, $156 billion is in the stock of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). An additional $90 billion is in the shares of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Warren Buffett picks his stocks carefully, and once he does, he holds on to them for dear life with few adjustments down the road."", 'Consider Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks. Three of his longest held stocks are Coca-Cola, American Express, and Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). While Mr. Buffett has tinkered with some of these companies before piling into them and waiting, his first major investments in the trio came in 1998, 1991, and 2000. Fast forwarding to today, this means that you would have to buy some new hot and upcoming companies and then wait until at least 2044 to have held them as long as Warren Buffett has.', ""Interestingly, American Express was also a key reason that Buffett was able to outperform the S&P 500 in the time periods we've shared above. He explained his journey in a 1968 shareholder letter where he outlined:"", 'Last year I referred to one investment which substantially outperformed the general market in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and because of its size (the largest proportion we have ever had in anything – we hit our 40% limit) had a very material impact on our overall results and, even more so, this category. This excellent performance continued throughout 1967 and a large portion of total gain was again accounted for by this single security. Our holdings of this security have been very substantially reduced and we have nothing in this group remotely approaching the size or potential which formerly existed in this investment.', ""So, today we'll look at some good stocks to buy for solid returns and the top three picks are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc.

In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers.

To skip our detailed analysis of the correlation between life expectancy and healthcare, and the global healthcare industry in general in 2023, go directly and see 10 Countries With the Most Centenarians.\xa0', 'Over the course of centuries, scientific advancements, innovation, increased investment, and enhanced trade and exchange across public, private, and social sectors have led to immense progress with respect to prolonging and improving the quality of life globally. In the last hundred years, life expectancy has grown dramatically across the world, especially in  countries with the most centenarians. At the center of this progress lies the leaps and strides made by the global healthcare industry. According to a report by Deloitte, healthcare spending accounts for more than 18.3% of the US GDP as of 2023. The global healthcare market is projected to reach $665.4 billion by 2028. The report reiterates the diversity and dynamism which exists within the healthcare equity investment landscape, ranging from emerging biotechnology companies to enormous healthcare conglomerates. The report goes on to predict that if the current trajectory continues, health spending is likely to triple by 2040, reaching $12 trillion or more than 26% of the global GDP. Largely exacerbated by inequalities related to race, gender, and socioeconomic status, the healthcare industry bleeds more than $320 billion in losses each year.', 'According to BlackRock, even in the face of intense inflationary pressure and other macroeconomic headwinds, the healthcare industry has conventionally displayed an enormous amount of resilience during equity market declines, primarily owing to the inelasticity of demand for a majority of healthcare products and services. This resilience came into play during the equity downturn in early 2023, when the industry as a whole demonstrated 23% less volatility, especially in  countries with the most centenarians. Some of the prominent players within the global healthcare arena are UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). To read more on the healthcare industry, check out our coverage of 20 Countries With the Most Expensive Healthcare in the World.', 'According to Forbes, there are many societal and technological drivers which will impact the healthcare industry in 2024, one of them being the instrumentality of gen AI. Gen AI is expected to democratize access to other AI applications, making it easier to implement and interpret results and generate personalized recommendations. Furthermore, the use of gen AI will further result in a much more efficient generation of synthetic data which can be utilized to train medical AI algorithms without compromising the confidentiality of the patient. The use of gen AI will also prove instrumental in the creation and integration of chatbots and virtual assistants, providing a more personalized and seamless experience for older patients in many of the  countries with the most centenarians.', 'Secondly, the article also asserts that top healthcare companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are diverting increased investments in the integration of a digital twin in healthcare processes. A digital twin is a virtual mirror image of a real-world system, object, place, tool, or mechanism. It can be used to simulate complex procedures and organize entire management and operational systems within an organization. Consistent innovation in the digital twins field has resulted in the creation of digital twins for the human body and individual organs to provide for a more streamlined medical experience for practitioners and patients alike.\xa0The article also predicts that IoT-powered virtual hospitals and telemedicine will replace conventional healthcare to a significant extent in 2024. Through the use of connected devices to remotely track patients and provide seamless and efficient communication avenues for healthcare practitioners, care can be transformed into a more well-rounded phenomenon and can also be delivered remotely. This trend has already started to take shape in the face of virtual hospital wards - where a central location acts as the control room for the monitoring and treatment of numerous patients in their own homes.', 'Furthermore, another trend which is likely to shape the future of modern healthcare in 2024 is the rising popularity and applicability of 3D printing. Additive manufacturing - which encompasses processes like 3D printing -\xa0 are expected to disrupt the healthcare market. For instance, in countries where medical equipment is difficult or too expensive to secure, additive manufacturing can be used to print tools and devices on demand, including surgical instruments, orthopedic or dental implants, and advanced prosthetics.

Consumer preferences are drastically shifting in  countries with the most centenarians, with patients now expecting transparency, predictability and digitization when it comes to their healthcare experiences. In this new consumer landscape, top healthcare companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are diverting greater investments to curate long-term relationships with their consumer base. According to McKinsey, patients who are satisfied with their healthcare provider are 28% less likely to switch providers. ', 'In this vein, companies are more than willing to reevaluate their marketing approach to maintain continuity of care. One way in which companies can do this is by aligning the C-suite. The CMO tends to require active involvement from leaders of other functions to deliver effective marketing campaigns and engage with the consumer base. Hence, companies must realize the critical nature of aligning the C-suite on the importance of marketing in generating robust growth figures and ensuring continuity of care. One implementation strategy for this objective is a clear definition of priority use cases through financial and nonfinancial returns on investment - from costs to enhanced health results. Companies could also adopt an agile marketing approach to drive high-speed testing across the digital domain and through traditional marketing channels. This would further require cross-functional collaboration and widescale transparency within the respective organization.\xa0', ""Lastly, companies must also invest in the construction of sophisticated capabilities by choosing cases strategically. According to the report, many healthcare companies have glaring lacunas in their critical capabilities which hinder an end-to-end, customized, seamless consumer journey. This is further exacerbated by a disjointed consumer experience, lack of personalization, siloed systems, and a serious deficit of consumer-centric data in  countries with the most centenarians. Since marketing teams are often restricted by stringent budgets, they will need to tactically prioritize use cases which can further bolster the company's momentum and growth."", 'Image by coombesy from Pixabay', 'To compile our list of the 20 countries with the most centenarians, we used the United Nations World Population Prospects Report 2022 to obtain the latest reliable demographic data.

This unexpected rise in retirements is evident in the significant difference between the number of retirees currently and what was forecasted by a Federal Reserve economic model. Though the gap has decreased from 2.8 million late last year, it remains higher than anticipated and has even increased from 1.7 million in June. Even with the increasing population of retirees in the US, numerous baby boomers express that they lack adequate funds to sustain their retirement lifestyle."", ""In the current market landscape, investing for retirement requires a thoughtful and diversified approach. With economic uncertainties, varying interest rates, and market volatility, choosing the right investment avenues becomes pivotal. Due to these challenges, many ordinary Americans are struggling to retire comfortably with their existing income. Bankrate's September survey revealed that approximately 56% of employed or temporarily unemployed Americans believe they're falling short in saving for retirement. Additionally, nearly a quarter of workers admitted to not making any contributions to their retirement accounts for at least a year. Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst, made the following comments in the report:"", '“Amid the tumultuous developments of the past several years, including a short but severe recession and a period of high and sustained inflation, a majority of Americans say they’re not where they need to be to achieve their retirement savings goals.”', 'Retirement investments ideally balance growth potential with stability. Typically, a diversified portfolio involving a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can be beneficial. In addition to this, dividend stocks can be a valuable component of a retirement portfolio due to their potential to generate consistent income. These stocks belong to companies that regularly distribute a portion of their earnings to shareholders. For retirees seeking a reliable income stream, dividend-paying stocks can be beneficial as they provide a source of passive income. Over recent years, dividend stocks have demonstrated considerable returns. Conover et al. (2016) conducted an empirical study spanning more than 50 years of US data, from 1962 to 2014, revealing that investing in dividend-paying stocks not only boosts returns but also notably mitigates risk across both value and growth portfolios, regardless of market capitalization. Their findings highlighted that the risk reduction was particularly pronounced when combining growth and value styles. The study also indicated that dividend-paying growth stocks tend to yield higher returns compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This research underscores the diversification advantages gained by incorporating an income-focused strategy into an investment portfolio.', 'Also read: Retirement Stock Portfolio: 12 Consumer Stocks To Consider', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

The market was largely dominated by the Asia Pacific region, which managed to garner a market share of more than 45% as of 2022. This is largely owing to increased industrialization and government policies geared at attracting FDI. As the region emerges as the largest manufacturing hubs in the world, countries like China and India are becoming increasingly eminent in foreign markets due to their potential for manufacturing goods at substantially low costs. Furthermore, the generation of large amounts of e-waste, primarily driven by the increased adoption of consumer electronics and various other electronic devices is expected to catalyze and exacerbate the growth of the larger waste recycling services market in 2024. A substantial portion of the overall market share is also held by North America and Europe, primarily driven by an enhanced awareness around the benefits of waste management and increased government initiatives to promote sustainability. Some of the largest waste recycling markets in the aforementioned regions are Germany, Austria, and Wales, which have a cumulative recycling rate of 52% and have some of the best recycling stocks to buy. To put this in perspective, the entire recycling rate in the United States in 35% as of 2022. As the world races to achieve net-zero targets, government policies around greener waste management are expected to grow more stringent, further driving the growth of the waste recycling services industry during the forecast period 2023-2032.

Consequently, the demand for circular polymers has been skyrocketing; however, capacity announcements do not seem to be at par with the surge in demand. According to a report by McKinsey, the global recycling industry offers a potential solution, in that it can not only expand the types of plastics which are recyclable but also develop plastics which have tailored molecular weight distributions and comonomers which are highly adept for high-value applications, like flexible packaging of food. Top players in the recycling business like Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN), Republic Services Inc. (NYSE:RSG), and LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) are diverting increased investments towards the recycled polymers segment, understanding that demand is on the rise due to increasing consumer awareness, CPG pledges, and stringent governmental regulations. These plastics can be manufactured through both, mechanical and advanced recycling. The best recycling stocks to buy now are increasingly focusing on the development of technology which will facilitate scale and reliability.

Investing in this system will demand enhance collaboration between the advanced recycling industry and the waste industry.

', ""For most people, investing often appears to be a black box. This was even truer before the current computing era that has placed copious amounts of financial and non financial information at everyone's fingertips. Buying a stock came with a variety of risks, and to mitigate these, a deeper understanding of the fundamentals was needed to avoid hefty losses. After all, there is no stop gap to a share price which can rapidly drop and erase all principal in the blink of an eye."", ""Yet, the finance industry is among the few that can truly transform an individual from rags to riches. The American Dream, for most parts, revolves around a stable source of income and a house - and as alluring and indispensable as this is, it is unlikely to make most people into overnight millionaires. With the financial sector, a couple of bets can transform anyone's life in ways previously thought unimaginable."", ""One of the biggest ways through which anyone can profit from the stock market is through share price appreciation. Just like there is no downward stop gap to how low stock can go, there's no upper bar, either. For instance, consider two stocks that everyone knows, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Meta's shares have more than doubled this year, as they opened 2023 at $124 and are now currently trading at $341. For the average retail investor with a total savings of $2,000, even if half of these had been invested into Meta at the start of 2023, it would have doubled for a generous return. For the more established folks, investing $10,000 in the shares would definitely have made investing worth its while. Similarly, NVIDIA's shares have more than tripled this year, so our hypothetical retail investor could have made more money than their savings by simply investing half of the savings in a single stock."", ""At the heart of making money through share price appreciation is an approach called value investing. For the uninitiated, it involves determining the fair value of a stock and then checking the market price to see whether it's lower or higher. If the market price is lower, then a buying decision is made based on a metric called the margin of safety. Since a value investing decision bases its buying decision on the assumption that the market value will match the fair value at some point in the future, the lower the market price, the higher the margin of safety is."", ""Warren Buffett is one of the strictest adherents of value investing, as is evident by his firm's investment portfolio. When compared to most of the hotshot hedge funds in the market, Berkshire Hathaway buys shares and then forgets about them - most of the time.

For instance, we took a look at Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks and discovered that his three longest held shares are those of Express Company (NYSE:AXP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), and his first major purchases were more than two decades back - or when most of Gen Z wasn't born.

Berkshire revealed on November 10 that this cash pile, primarily invested in short-term treasuries, exceeded the previous record set two years ago. Additionally, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.76 billion, indicating an increase compared to last year. This was attributed to the impact of higher interest rates on the cash reserves and profitability in its insurance businesses. Buffett, finding dull investment avenues in the market, focused heavily on share repurchases in Q3 instead.\xa0', 'In the third quarter of 2023, Buffett completed $1.1 billion worth of share buybacks, putting his total repurchases around $7 billion at the end of September. Keeping in mind investment and derivatives losses, the hedge fund posted a Q3 loss of approximately $12.8 billion, which was mainly explained by losses in its equity portfolio. However, Buffett advises investors to consider factors beyond investment gains or losses, noting that these figures can be potentially misleading due to accounting rules.', ""Don't Miss: Warren Buffett and Corporate Insiders Love These Stocks"", 'Earlier this year, Warren Buffett increased his investments in five Japanese trading houses, drawing praise from Chamath Palihapitiya, who referred to him as ""the GOAT."" The companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo – share a conglomerate structure similar to Berkshire Hathaway. They have a history of stable dividend payments and earnings growth. Palihapitiya\xa0 admired the brilliance of Buffett\'s trade, observing his ability to hedge currency risk by selling Japanese debt and profiting from the difference between investment dividends and bond coupon payments.\xa0', ""Additionally, Buffett continues to rely on his largest investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which constitutes half of Berkshire's equity portfolio. Buffett sees Apple as a consumer products company, and he is drawn to its substantial buyback programs. The Berkshire investment in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has generated over $100 billion in gains since 2016. On the other hand, Berkshire Hathaway has trimmed its Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) position for four consecutive quarters. Despite the divestment, Chevron remains the fifth-largest equity holding for Berkshire, valued at $18.5 billion.

During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share, indicating a change of -42.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.6% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $1.45 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -40.6%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed -15.7%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.2%.

Another trial called BOREAS showed similarly strong results in March.', 'If approved, Dupixent would be the first biologic drug for people with moderate-to-severe COPD who have signs of what’s known as “Type 2 inflammation,” a form of immune response that Dupixent tamps down.', 'Dupixent is one of the pharmaceutical industry’s most successful products. Approved in the U.S. to treat five different inflammatory conditions, the drug is by far each of the companies’ top-seller.', 'An approval in COPD could help expand Dupixent’s market further, and give people with COPD a new option for counteracting the disease “exacerbations” that erode lung function.', 'Regeneron and Sanofi have already applied for an approval in the EU, where data from BOREAS are being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency. The positive data give the companies the additional support they need to seek an OK in the U.S.', 'NOTUS and BOREAS were designed to be matching Phase 3 trials comparing Dupixent to placebo in current or former smokers who had COPD and met criteria showing their disease involved Type 2 inflammation. Together, the studies enrolled nearly 1,900 people, all of whom were already on and continued COPD treatment with other drugs.', 'In NOTUS, treatment with Dupixent cut the rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations versus placebo by 34% over one year, slightly higher than the 30% reported in BOREAS. Both studies also showed the drug improved lung function, measured by forced expiratory volume over one second.', '“We think the replication of reductions in COPD exacerbations across two Phase 3 trials creates a high probability scenario that the indication will be added to the label,” wrote Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird, in a note to clients. Dupixent is already used in asthma, so pulmonary specialists are already likely familiar with the drug, Skorney noted, which could help any future commercial launch.', 'Side effects in the NOTUS study were generally similar to what was reported in BOREAS. More people on Dupixent in NOTUS had COVID-19, nasopharyngitis or headache than did those who received placebo. There were also more deaths from adverse events in the treatment arm than in the control, but that was not the case in BOREAS.', 'To Regeneron and Sanofi, the data prove the role played by Type 2 inflammation in COPD, a disease that’s long been linked to amplified “innate” immune responses. One-fifth to two-fifths of affected individuals also appear to have Type 2 inflammatory responses, however.', 'Regeneron and Sanofi are developing another drug for COPD called itepekimab.

Given a solid balance sheet, the company’s capital distributions seem sustainable, through which it will likely enhance shareholder value.However, significant outflows in the company’s Asset Management (AM) segment, along with steadily rising expenses, are expected to hurt the bottom line to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMP’s current-year earnings has been revised 1.8% lower over the past 60 days, indicating that analysts are not optimistic regarding its earnings growth potential. Thus, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past six months, shares of Ameriprise have gained 13.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 13.9%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Looking at its fundamentals, the company’s net revenues (GAAP basis) witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% over the four-year period (ended 2022). The upward momentum continued in the first nine months of 2023. AMP constantly modifies its product and service-offering capability to keep pace with dynamic market needs. This strategy, along with asset growth, has helped it record a rise in the top line.The company’s efforts to launch products are likely to keep supporting net revenue growth in the quarters ahead. We project GAAP net revenues to grow 8.4%, 3.7% and 2.5% in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.Moreover, Ameriprise has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations. The acquisition of BMO Financial Group’s EMEA asset management operations in 2021 bolstered AMP’s wealth and asset management businesses and supported its global diversification efforts. In 2019, Ameriprise divested the Ameriprise Auto & Home business.The above-mentioned initiatives are expected to further support revenue growth.We remain encouraged by Ameriprise’s impressive capital distribution activities. In April 2023, it announced a dividend hike for the 16th time since 2010. It also has a share repurchase plan in place. In July 2023, its board of directors authorized an additional $3.5 billion worth of repurchase plan through Sep 30, 2025. In January 2022, a buyback program worth $3 billion (expiring on Mar 31, 2024) was authorized. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had $3.6 billion worth of shares left to be repurchased under the plans.However, the company’s AM segment, which is one of the major sources of revenues (accounting for 21.3% of total adjusted operating net revenues in the first nine months of 2023), has been witnessing outflows. The weakness is expected to persist in the quarters ahead, given the tough operating backdrop. This will likely adversely impact the segment’s top-line performance.While AMP’s GAAP expenses declined in 2020, the metric witnessed a CAGR of 1.7% over the four-year period ended 2022. The uptrend continued in the first nine months of 2023. The company’s initiatives to focus on cost management have resulted in controlled general and administrative expenses, but overall costs are expected to remain elevated due to advertising campaigns, hiring, inflation and technology upgrades.

On its last reported quarter's earnings call, management expected its sales backdrop to remain challenging in the fiscal third quarter. Big Lots is likely to have witnessed persistent pressure in the demand environment, primarily for higher tickets and other discretionary items.The closure of a key vendor led to product shortages that have been affecting the company’s furniture sales. Lower tax refunds and higher interest rates might have dented the demand for its products, in turn affecting its performance. Consequently, management forecasts comparable sales to decline in the low teens range for the fiscal third quarter.High costs and operating expenses might have been a concern for the company. For instance, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 370 basis points year over year to 39.8%. Higher occupancy, depreciation and advertising costs are likely to have marred its margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Our model estimates adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales to increase 430 basis points in the fiscal third quarter.The company’s focus on cost management and operational efficiency, along with lower inbound freight rates, are likely to have offered some respite. Our estimate for the gross margin is pegged at 36% in the quarter, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 200 basis points.Big Lots’ Operation North Star initiative and e-commerce business appear encouraging as well.

Discounts this year are varying widely from retailer to retailer, so in some cases, they shoppers may not be getting as big of a discount as they got last year."", 'Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins the Live show to discuss some of these record numbers and how certain retailers are capitalizing on very active consumers this holiday season.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""SEANA SMITH: Well, let's talk a little bit more about those promotions because discounts and sales, they are in focus as retailers try everything they can to get shoppers to spend. Here with a closer look at our very own Brooke DiPalma. And Brooke, I think all shoppers out there are asking themselves how this year's promotions stack up to what we saw last year. What are you seeing?"", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Well, consumers certainly, as I said on Wednesday before this cyber weekend, they need to know their prices because what we're seeing is these big box and these apparel retailers really come out and say that we have the biggest deal yet, but actually some of them are in line with last year, more than last year, and some discounts even less year over year."", ""Some retailers that got a call out in notes so far, Jefferies saying that Abercrombie & Fitch is a clear winner here. Now, what's important to note here is that last year they had 30% off, this year 25% off. But what we've seen in their recent earnings reports is that consumers continue to go to Abercrombie. They continue to shop there. And so despite that 5% discount that's less than last year, consumers are still expected to shop there."", ""Another one that we are keeping a close eye on is recreation and the leisure category. We're thinking Yeti Academy, Dick's Sporting Goods. Jefferies analyst saying that despite promos being flat year over year, these sort of retailers continue to do well in a more promotional environment. Another one to look out here is Gap. The analysts there said that they're in the early innings of what they said was a turnaround."", ""Now, what's interesting once again is that year over year promotions are flat. And at Old Navy, those promotions even decreased, but that is one to watch. Urban Outfitters also increased their promotions, but they're one brand Anthropologie was flat over a year."", ""And one other thing that I've continued to see is that beauty remains a resilient category. Piper Sandler shouting out E.l.f, Coty and IPAR, Inter Parfums that is. We continue to see these splurging among consumers as they stock up on beauty. They continue to do those day-to-day purchases. Those lotions, the mascara. Those little daily use products continue to do well in this sort of environment and they certainly did well this week."", ""DIANE KING HALL: Kind of like brings back memories of the lipstick indicator. I mean, people will still splurge on their beauty products even when their wallets are tightening. But interestingly enough. Now when you think about both how we've talked about how much consumers have become reliant on their credit cards, despite tightening credit environment, but now using more of the BNPL way of checking off their list."", ""Another thing that stood out to me was I saw some data showing that the average discount this year was about 35% And you know so you're seeing some varying to your point-- some variance to your point about where that discount is. So some places it's marginally lower than it was a year ago, some places it's a little higher, but then you get to the average."", ""But another interesting thing-- pattern that I saw this year and we've talked about this for years on end is this overtaking of the online footprint, clicks versus bricks, right? And even when we saw the images from Sozzi being out at the mall on Friday, it was less foot traffic than we've seen in previous years. And you can see it by the numbers. Even when you think about what the expectation for the numbers today, we're expecting $12 billion for Cyber Monday, that would outstrip the record number for Black Friday."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. This is certainly not your 2013 Black Friday anymore sadly, although that was fun while it lasted. You know, definitely something to watch out for too is the timeline between Thanksgiving and Christmas is here.', 'Christmas does fall on a Monday, a lot of analysts expect shoppers to wait till that last weekend to get the best bang for their buck, to get the best prices for their last-minute Christmas shopping.
