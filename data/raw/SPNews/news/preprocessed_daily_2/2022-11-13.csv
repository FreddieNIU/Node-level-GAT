Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$8.8m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Texas InstrumentsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Richard Templeton, for US$5.9m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$179. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 6.8% of Richard Templeton's holding.Insiders in Texas Instruments didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Texas Instruments insiders own about US$177m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Texas Instruments Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Texas Instruments shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Texas Instruments insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Texas Instruments and understanding these should be part of your investment process.But note: Texas Instruments may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Given the increased affordability of technology, it is estimated that there could be 7.5 billion internet users by 2030.With so many internet users and also so many computers and smartphones, some tech companies listed on the Nasdaq Composite Index have achieved enormous scale and realize significant profits.Nasdaq Composite Index &amp; NASDAQ ExchangeWhen it comes to NASDAQ, there is an index commonly known in the media as 'the NASDAQ' that is also known as the Nasdaq Composite Index.The Nasdaq Composite Index includes all domestic and international common type stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

(NYSE:TMO) insiders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-4-7m-worth-140014895.html,1668261614,STORY,['TMO'],"[Even though Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stock gained 8.7% last week, insiders who sold US$4.7m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$551, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Thermo Fisher Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$542 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$539. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own about US$346m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Thermo Fisher Scientific Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Thermo Fisher Scientific insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders selling.

(NYSE:WMT) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 27.9x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for Walmart as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Walmart peKeen to find out how analysts think Walmart's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Walmart's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 41%. As a result, it also grew EPS by 15% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 13% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.2% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Walmart's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Walmart's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Story continuesBefore you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Walmart that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Xi Jinping once called Joe Biden “my old friend” and the U.S. President responded with a similar endearment.Lately, however, Biden called Xi “a thug”, after China made clear that not even the United States could stand in its way of acquiring Taiwan. Despite such adversity, White House officials are counting on the one-time personal connection between the two men to resurface at the summit and lead to Sino-American cooperation in areas with common goals. In fact, Xi might already be assisting a Biden goal in the strangest way possible: Low oil prices via China’s Covid-zero (or alternatively zero-Covid) policy.Unless you’ve been living under a rock, there’s little chance that you’d have missed the almost daily headlines on the Xi administration’s whack-a-mole way of dealing with the coronavirus now, three years after the virus had its first outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Using snap lockdowns, mass testing, extensive contact tracing and quarantines to stamp out infections as soon as they emerge, the Covid-zero policy has taken a heavy toll on the world’s number two economy and led to angry backlashes from its people.Thus, Friday’s move to reduce the quarantine period for travelers in China, along with the scrapping of a restriction on international flights, appeared to be a compromise by Beijing to appease a population that had become weary of one lockdown after another - a phenomenon no longer happening in any other country.Many suspect Xi ultimately has no intention to do away with the policy - a conviction arising not just from his renewing of his no-Covid vow when he was sworn in for a historic third term as president.Some say China’s reasons for the policy go beyond health - into the territory of national pride, for instance.Story continuesBeijing relies entirely on home-grown vaccines for Covid - which, according to experts interviewed by Western media, aren’t as effective as globally-trusted brand names such as Pfizer, Moderna Novavax, and J&amp;J.A Hong Kong study cited by Barron’s suggests that Chinese-produced Sinovac needs three injections to provide equivalent protection to Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines. Sufficient data to disprove this is difficult to come by, as China keeps a tight lid on information-sharing.Beijing is now trying to develop its own mRNA vaccine, similar to Pfizer and Moderna’s, but it’s fallen far behind as a result, media reports have said.Others cite pure financial or economic reasons, saying pandemic-emergency responses limit any sort of run on Chinese banks and allow Beijing to bypass U.S. sanctions on Russian oil to buy limitless amounts of this at rock-bottom prices.China saved about $3 billion in buying Russian oil versus other imports between April and July, according to Reuters' calculation based on customs data. On average, China paid about $708 per tonne for Russian crude while the value of imports from the rest of the countries was $816 per tonne.Biden, of course, doesn’t give a rodent’s rear to what China is doing to fight Covid; how many Chinese are in undeserved lockdowns and whether local vaccines will save them or cause irreversible damage over time (sorry for the bluntness).But if the sum of all actions by Beijing brings the price of oil down, we can assume the U.S. president will be happy.China is the world’s largest importer of crude: last year, it imported 11.8 million barrels per day, outpacing the United States, which takes in 9.1 million barrels per day.Back in May, the oil price rally came to a screeching halt after Beijing adopted a zero-Covid strategy and announced strict containment measures that included major lockdowns. But the restrictions also had a severely negative impact on Chinese consumer demand and manufacturing output.According to year-on-year (y-o-y) figures for April, retail sales fell by 11.1%, industrial production by 2.9% and manufacturing by 4.6%. Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan and the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index both fell in tandem in April.In the past two weeks, as OPEC+ - the Saudi-led and Russia-assisted global oil producing alliance - got down to observing a 2 million-barrels-per-day output cut, China’s Covid-zero policy was back in the headlines. Brent crude came within cents of revisiting $100 a barrel on Monday before tumbling 6% on the week. The oil market’s drop came after reports of an explosion in new Covid cases in China’s export-heavy Guangdong province raised fears that the authorities could reintroduce tough Shanghai-style lockdowns instituted earlier this year.The People’s Bank of China, or PBOC, is still acting cautiously due to concerns about further yuan weakness, which can potentially trigger large capital outflows in a Fed rate hiking cycle. The yuan and corporate bond yields fell sharply after the PBOC announced a cut in banks’ reserve requirements in mid-April. Since then, the currency has stabilized, but bond yields have started climbing again. Net debt issuance by the government clocked in at more than 700 hundred billion yuan ($104 billion) in both May and June, the two highest monthly totals since mid-2020, and more liquidity will be required from the PBOC if the rapid clip of local government debt issuance is going to continue.Beijing will now be forced to either bring forward a larger part of next year’s planned quota or take other strong measures to bolster local government finances. It can also allow more off-the-book borrowing by city governments, although that would be difficult due to high bond yields. Unless Chinese policymakers act to sharply bolster local government finances and the PBOC is willing to risk more yuan depreciation, a weak rebound in the second half of the year is seen as the most likely scenario.There are now growing signs that the Chinese economy may be entering a prolonged era of slow growth.The world’s second-largest economy is projected to grow just 2% this year, significantly lower than the above 6% it maintained over the past decade.Maintaining a Covid-zero policy has been slowing the economy and adding huge additional costs to the government budget, leaving Beijing in a dilemma about whether to boost debt or tolerate weak economic growth.Even before the spending pressures brought on by the pandemic, the Chinese economy was in trouble, most notably due to a slump in land sales revenue amid a housing slowdown, compounded by tax relief to businesses that cut government income. Official data shows the wide-ranging budget deficit reached a record nearly 3 trillion yuan ($448 billion) in the first five months of the year.China is still facing severe economic uncertainty, and oil imports are one barometer.All these are taking a toll on China’s demand for crude.OPEC itself has predicted that Chinese buying of oil will decline by 60,000 barrels per day this year, after forecasting an increase of 120,000 bpd only a month ago thanks to new lockdowns. OPEC has cut its demand growth view for 2022 by 460,000 bpd to 2.64 million bpd and for 2023 by 360,000 bpd to 2.34 million bpd, citing “the extension of China’s zero-Covid-19 restrictions in some regions, economic challenges in OECD Europe, and inflationary pressures in other key economies.”Inflation has been the proverbial albatross around Biden’s neck all year prior to October, with more than 80% of Americans polled before this month’s midterm elections citing concerns about high gasoline and energy prices. If China can somehow keep oil prices from escalating and driving inflation back towards June’s 40-year highs, that will work splendidly for the U.S. president.Summer-time record highs of $5 a gallon for gasoline were what drove Biden to drain nearly half of America’s emergency oil reserve. Now, having brought a gallon to well below $4, the president has to think of a way of refilling the reserve. If China’s Covid-zero policy can keep a barrel from revisiting the much-feared $100-and-above-a-barrel, Xi will be a friend indeed.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Crude prices climbed out of a three-day hole as U.S. inflation at 9-month lows suggested the Federal Reserve could do a smaller rate hike in December that could benefit businesses as a whole, including oil drillers and refiners.Most commodities rallied strongly between Thursday and Friday on the prospect of the Fed rate pivot. But the rebound in oil on the day wasn’t enough though to prevent the market from posting a weekly loss.“It's been quite the volatile week for oil, with Chinese rumors [over Covid] not going away, [and] restrictions and mass testing being undertaken once more,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.New York-traded Crude Oil WTI Futures, or WTI, for delivery in December did a final trade of $88.86 per barrel on Friday after settling the official session at $88.96, up $2.49, or 2.9%, on the day.WTI, however, ended the week down 6.6%, after two back-to-back weekly wins of about 5% and 3.5%. The decline was mostly due to a net drop of 7% between Monday and Wednesday.London-traded Brent crude for January did a final trade of $95.78 after settling Friday’s session at $95.99, up $2.32, or 2.5%, on the day. For the week, the global crude benchmark fell 2.6% after gains of about 3%, 2.5% and 2% over the three prior weeks.Oil Price Outlook: WTIWTI’s inability to rebound from its losses for the week denotes larger problems for the U.S. crude benchmark, says Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“WTI’s weekly Relative Strength Indicator at 47 is below neutrality while its weekly stochastics at 59/59 also favors neutrality and awaits triggers,” said Dixit.For the week ahead, if WTI fails again to clear the 50-week Exponential Moving Average of $90.60 and the weekly Middle Bollinger Band of $90.90, it will stay under bearish pressure, with 84.70 likely to be retested and prices can drop further to 100 week SMA 80.80.On the flip side, accumulation of momentum above 80.80 followed by a revival above 91.00 will witness another return to a bullish channel that aims 97 and 105 in the mid-term.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold bulls had their biggest week in 30 months as their two biggest tormentors - the dollar and cryptos - were vanquished this week.U.S. gold futures’ benchmark December contract did a final trade of $1,774.20 an ounce on Friday, after settling the official session at $1,769.40 - up $15.70, or almost 1%, on the day on New York’s Comex.More importantly, it rose $92.80, or 5.5% on the week - its most since a 6.5% jump during the week to April 3, 2020.The spot price of bullion, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,771.42 an ounce, up $15.81, or 0.9%.Gold has rocketed since Thursday as U.S. inflation registered its slowest annual reading in nine months, heightening speculation that the Federal Reserve will back off from the aggressive rate hikes it has executed since March, sending the dollar crashing.The Dollar Index, which pits the greenback against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc, was down 4.1% on the week, its most since a 4.8% weekly drop in March 2020.Cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are in a crisis of their own after industry leader Bitcoin fell over 20% on the week as crypto-exchange FTX headed for bankruptcy.Gold is probably winning at least some of the money that had exited cryptocurrencies this week, said Phillip Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago.“There’s no hard data to corroborate fund flows from crypto into gold now but I’d be surprised if that isn’t happening,” Streible said.“Normally, it’s the other way round as gold seldom finds love from the crypto crowd. But gold looks relatively safer now than digital currencies and imagine it has gained new respect that could mean higher allocations that may have been meant for crypto.”Erlam joins a legion of analysts around the world who expect gold to get to $1,800 at least after clearing resistance at between $,1770 and $1,780.“Gold bulls have been waiting for this week for a long time: a week (or so) in which the Fed signaled a potential slowing of rate hikes and the CPI data displayed a significant and broad-based decline,” Erlam said.The CPI, or Consumer Price Index, registered in October its slowest annual growth in nine months, expanding just 7.7% over a 12-month period, versus a growth of 8% forecast by economists and against the previous yearly growth of 8.2% to September.Gold: Price Outlook Seven months of relentless beating and being pushed to the wall seemed enough for gold bulls, who are now fighting back, said SKCharting’s Dixit who tracks bullion’s spot price.“We’ve seen multiple drops in spot gold since the first quarter, and each time $1,615 came to support the metal,” Dixit said. “Gold bulls seem to be saying ‘don’t take us for granted’ this time around.”Dixit said oversold monthly stochastics supported by divergence in weekly stochastics led to a decisive price breakout in gold, at above the previous month's high of $1,730.The short-term trend also turned bullish, testing the 50-week Exponential Moving Average of $1,771.70, he said.“The short-term bullish rebound is very likely to test the monthly Middle Bollinger Band of $1,797 and the 200-Day Simple Moving Average of $1,804, which is 100-week SMA as well.""Dixit cautioned about the possibility of correction as the daily Stochastics and the Daily Relative Strength Indicator reach overbought conditions, respectively at 99/93 and 70. This can cause spot gold to pull back towards support areas of $1,750 and $1,730, he said.“Whatever bearish pressure descends on gold now, the short-term trend turns bullish if traders interpret the pullback as a means to execute value buying,” said Dixit. “If gold gains acceptance above $1,805 as a result of this, expect the next targets to be $1,850 and $1,875.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesDying lands: Farmers fight to save the 'skin of the Earth'What to watch this weekend at COP27 in Egypt]"

If you want to skip our industry introduction and jump ahead to the top five firms in the list, then take a look at Top 5 LPG Shipping Companies in the World. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting crisis in energy markets have led to a shortage of oil in the market. With winters on the horizon, Europe and other regions in the world are shifting towards alternative fuel sources. Additionally, the demand for non-Russian oil has also grown, particularly from Europe which has tried to reduce its dependence on Russian products due to the ongoing war.Against this backdrop, the shipping industry is one sector that has managed to withstand the broader market bloodbaths that have ended up decimating investment portfolios and a host of different firms. For LPG, the fuel is shipped in specialized vessels and the sector is primed for growth. These vessels are characterized as very large, large, medium, and small gas carriers, and they also come with varying levels of pressure and temperature control. A research report from Straits Research estimates that the sector was worth $182 million last year and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% by the end of this year to 2030 for a final value of $286 million by the end of the forecast period.The research firm believes that the growth in fracking and increasing partnerships between the U.S., India, and Japan will drive this growth as LPG will need to be transported over great distances. Still, Europe accounted for the largest market share of $52 million in 2021, with Asia Pacific coming in second place. In terms of capacity and ship type, the very large gas carrier is the most popular, and it is expected to grow at a 7% CAGR between 2021 and 2030, to be worth $77 million by 2030 end.Grand View Research also has a similar 5% CAGR for the LPG tanker market for the time period between 2022 and 2030, with the estimated final value of the segment pegged at $287 million. It also outlines that the Very Large tanker segment is the largest, and Europe was the busiest region even in 2021 before the war-induced energy crises hit.Story continuesToday's piece will take a look at the top firms in the crucial industry, and it consists of names such as Qatar Gas Transport Company Limited (Nakilat) (QPSC) (QGTS.QA), Teekay Corporation (NYSE:TK), and BW LPG Limited (OTCMKTS:BWLLF).

11,49b96829-6679-3ab2-bde8-0abf0aced534,MS,2022-11-13,Why We're Not Concerned About Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-were-not-concerned-morgan-130050811.html,1668344450,STORY,['MS'],"[There wouldn't be many who think Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 12.8x is worth a mention when the median P/E in the United States is similar at about 15x. While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Morgan Stanley's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile. See our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Morgan Stanley.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/E?Morgan Stanley's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 12%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 50% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 8.6% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.2% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Morgan Stanley is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Morgan Stanley's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.As we suspected, our examination of Morgan Stanley's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook is contributing to its current P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to support the share price at these levels.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Morgan Stanley, and understanding should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Morgan Stanley. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Even traditional safe havens like gold and silver are in the red.Yet one asset class remains attractive — at least to those who can afford it: fine art.On Wednesday night, the art collection of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen fetched a total of $1.5 billion at Christie’s New York, making it the most valuable private collection of all time.The auction was record-breaking in many ways.“Never before have more than two paintings exceeded $100 million in a single sale, but tonight, we saw five,” Max Carter, vice chairman, 20th and 21st-century art at Christie’s, said in a statement.“Four were masterpieces from the fathers of modernism — Cezanne, Seurat, Van Gogh and Gauguin.”Per Allen’s wishes, all of the proceeds from the auction will go to philanthropy. Allen passed away in 2018.Don't MissWant to earn big returns without the shaky stock market? Try artMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two assets — get in now before the super-rich swarmYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Art as an investmentIt’s easy to understand why great works of art tend to appreciate — even during times of economic strife. Supply is limited, and many famous pieces have already been snatched up by museums and collectors.Art is also a popular way to diversify because it's a tangible physical asset with little correlation to the stock market. In fact, contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart.According to Deloitte’s latest Art &amp; Finance Report, 85% of wealth managers in 2021 believed art should be included as part of a wealth management service.Purchasing fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra-rich. But these days, crowdsourcing platforms let you invest in iconic artworks, too.Story continuesReal estate mogulFine art wasn’t the only thing in Allen’s portfolio. The tech billionaire also had substantial real estate holdings.In July, it was reported that Allen’s estate sold two apartments in New York City for $101 million. Later that month, his estate sold eight properties on Lake Washington’s Mercer Island for $67 million.Real estate has been a popular asset class as of late — perhaps because it’s a well-known hedge against inflation.As the price of raw materials and labor goes up, new properties are more expensive to build. And that drives up the price of existing real estate.Well-chosen properties can provide more than just price appreciation. Investors also get to earn a steady stream of rental income.Of course, while we all like the idea of collecting passive income, being a landlord does come with its hassles, like fixing leaky faucets and dealing with difficult tenants.But you don’t need to be a landlord to start investing in real estate. There are plenty of real estate investment trusts (REITs) as well as crowdfunding platforms that can get you started on becoming a real estate mogul.Gates has been hoarding thisAllen co-founded Microsoft with his childhood friend Bill Gates. According to Forbes, Gates is currently the sixth richest person in the world with a net worth of $103.8 billion.As you’d expect, Gates also has an art collection and a real estate portfolio. What’s more intriguing, though, is that he’s also been hoarding farmland.Earlier this year, it was reported that Gates has amassed nearly 270,000 acres of farmland across dozens of states. That makes him the largest private owner of farmland in America.You don’t need an MBA to see the appeal of farmland: markets can go up or down, but no matter what happens, people still need to eat.That makes farmland intrinsically valuable.Of course, not everyone is interested in farming. But you can invest in farmland without getting your hands dirty.All-in-one investment platforms that allow you to invest in farmland directly by taking a stake in a farm of your choice. You’ll earn cash income from the leasing fees and crop sales — and any long-term appreciation on top of that.What to read nextMorgan Stanley: Prices for Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet watches will keep plunging due to a flood of supply — but these 3 real assets remain scarce and covetedNot just job cuts: Elon Musk eliminated Twitter's ‘Days of rest’ and work-from-home policies last week — pushing a '24/7' work culture.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Starbucks’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks Is Starbucks Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 0.4% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Starbucks today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $97.75, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, Starbucks’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will Starbucks generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 53% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Starbucks. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SBUX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SBUX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$9.9m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, David Solomon, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$335 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$385, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 8.0% of David Solomon's holding.Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Goldman Sachs Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Goldman Sachs Group shares. Specifically, Chairman &amp; CEO David Solomon ditched US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$632m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs Group Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Schlumberger is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$44b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 11%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Energy Services industry average of 5.8% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Schlumberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Schlumberger here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Schlumberger Tell Us?We're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Schlumberger. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 165% over the trailing five years. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 46% less capital than it was five years ago. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, it's great to see that Schlumberger has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Since the stock has only returned 3.7% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.If you want to continue researching Schlumberger, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.7%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Newmont Newmont Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was much higher than its earnings. It will be difficult to sustain this level of payout so we wouldn't be confident about this continuing.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 47.5%. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 173%, which is a bit high and could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.40 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.20. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.6% a year over that time. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.Newmont Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that Newmont has grown earnings per share at 51% per year over the past five years. Although earnings per share is up nicely Newmont is paying out 180% of its earnings as dividends, which we feel is borderline unsustainable without extenuating circumstances.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. Strong earnings growth means Newmont has the potential to be a good dividend stock in the future, despite the current payments being at elevated levels. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Newmont (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.

28,ccef1ad1-4e12-317b-af67-da9bd8e05636,ZTS,2022-11-13,"Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) jumps 11% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-nyse-zts-jumps-11-120019075.html,1668340819,STORY,['ZTS'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 15% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. It's fair to say most would be happy with 110% the gain in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 31% drop, in the last year.The past week has proven to be lucrative for Zoetis investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. View our latest analysis for Zoetis To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 16% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Zoetis' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Zoetis's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Zoetis' TSR for the last 5 years was 116%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Zoetis shareholders are down 31% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 20%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 17% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Zoetis better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Zoetis .Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The great tech wreck of 2022 is in stark contrast to the easy gains investors enjoyed between 2020-2021. With the pandemic, the associated lockdown, low interest rates, and the endless stimulus packages absent, tech stocks are at a multi-year discount.Speculators are no longer willing to bet on unproven technology companies. They are shunning companies that are either too expensive, warned markets that growth will slow, or do not make a profit.Now that they are out of favor, investors who missed out on the tremendous run-up before this year have another chance. Since no one can predict when the technology sell-off will end, long-term investors may minimize buying risks. Instead of buying full positions in discounted tech stocks, buy them in phases. That way, if a stock gets cheaper, buy-and-hold investors may buy the stock again to lower the price paid.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBe prepared to hold the companies for several quarters. The market sentiment is not about to turn positive and stay there. Similarly, a company’s business turnaround could take several quarters. Struggling firms might need to cut costs and foster growth before the business improves.SymbolCompanyPriceADBEAdobe$301.80DDOGDatadog$67.19NETCloudflare$38.50NOWServiceNow$364.68OKTAOkta$45.96QCOMQualcomm$112.41TWLOTwilio$43.07Adobe (ADBE)A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue skySource: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) traded as high as $699.54 last year and is less than half that price. The company wants to strengthen its offering in collaborative web applications. It proposed to buy Figma for a high price tag of $20 billion. The Department of Justice is preparing to probe Adobe’s deal.Figma released its first software in 2016. The products would help graphic designers make mobile applications and websites faster. Adobe’s Chief Executive Officer, Shantanu Narayen, said multiple people would need more collaboration. Adobe’s knowledge workers would use Figma’s collaborative whiteboarding through the FigJam product.Story continuesAdobe needs to strengthen its creative collaboration software. Customers may start to cancel their monthly subscription if the return on their investment falls. Adobe has grown in its imaging, vector, and video technology in the last few decades. Today, mobile applications have an enormous addressable market opportunity.Although Adobe is navigating tough macroeconomic headwinds, it has solid new user acquisition, and robust engagement and retention levels remain.Datadog (DDOG)The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.Source: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.comDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a cloud-scale applications provider. In the third quarter, it posted revenue growing by 61% Y/Y to $437 million. DDOG stock could trend lower since it still loses money on a GAAP basis. In this bear market, cautious investors are wary of taking a big position in this company. However, they need to realize that customers still need hyperscalers to optimize costs.Datadog’s longtime customers will not slow down on their migration to the cloud. They have an urgency to scale their backend solution on Datadog’s platform. This private environment is not the only growth catalyst. In the private environment, customers need their critical environment supported by Datadog’s hyperscaler.Cybersecurity is an ongoing concern for customers. Fortunately, Datadog has many security use cases. For example, it could consolidate its cost structure instead of having its data managed by different vendors. It gives Datadog a chance to demonstrate the value of using its product more frequently. This increases its revenue potential per customer.Cloudflare (NET)In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCloudflare (NYSE:NET) stock dropped by nearly one-fifth in value on Nov. 4 after it posted results. Revenue grew by 47.3% Y/Y to $253.86M, but it only earned six cents a share (non-GAAP). Its GAAP net loss was $42.5 million.Investors dumped the stock because Cloudflare reported delayed buying decisions from customers. For example, customers are more sensitive to prices in the Asia Pacific region. The company will realize revenue in future quarters by pushing out its Cloudflare orders later.Investors may take advantage of the market panic by adding a starter position at current levels. Still, near-term risks are on the rise. Churn rates from pay-as-you-go customers increased due mainly to a shift down to its free customer tier.Investors may also bet that as the economy rebounds in 2023, the non-revenue-generating customers will upgrade their service back to the paid level. In the last quarter, Cloudflare ended the quarter with 1,908 large customers. As they order more services, revenue from these customers will expand. Thus, NET is one of the top discounted tech stocks to buy.ServiceNow (NOW)ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is on sale after the company posted mixed results. Revenue grew by 21.2% Y/Y to $1.83 billion. However, the software firm lowered its subscription revenue guidance for the year.Servicenow has a loyal customer base. It had 1,530 customers paying over $1 million in annual contract value or ACV. In Q3, it reported a renewal rate of 98%. Thus, it makes the list as one of the discounted tech stocks to buy.Servicenow has a durable business that thrives regardless of economic conditions. It sells a mission-critical solution, and the Now platform is the standard in digital transformation. Customers need the Now platform to drive automation and productivity in this increasingly weaker economy. In addition, the great resignation movement is still a threat to corporations. Servicenow increases customer satisfaction. Corporate customers benefit from the product by offering a pleasant experience for their employees.Investors may worry about the lofty price-to-earnings of NOW stock. However, the company has strong close rates. It is confident that it will win more deals in the coming quarters.Okta (OKTA)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Okta (OKTA) logo.Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.comOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) manages and secures user authentication for client applications. As customers continue to pivot away from the access management market from Windows Systems, Okta’s privilege access management and identity governance market will thrive.Investors are worried that Okta’s growth rate will slow. The firm is adjusting for a potential slowdown by improving its efficiency over time. It is investing in the business. For example, it increased its sales and marketing representatives. Fortunately, it is not over-hiring staff. It balances its support for growth by minimizing its cash burn rate.At these levels, the stock is likely pricing in expectations of a slower long-term growth rate. Still, Okta proved that it could compete in this marketplace.In the second quarter, Okta posted strong subscription revenue growth. For the year, it expects revenue will grow by between 39% to 40% Y/Y. Still, it will lose up to $105 million (non-GAAP). Once Okta finds a path to profitability, the stock will rise.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquartersSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) fell after posting strong revenue growth in the quarter. Investors are worried about the company facing a rapid deterioration in demand. In addition, the easing supply constraint created an elevated channel inventory. As a result, the company cut its earnings per share guidance by 80 cents.QCOM stock is a bargain from here. Investors have priced in the macro headwinds that are hurting consumer handset demand. Furthermore, the sector has an overhang in inventory after the channel delays eased. Investors need only wait for Qualcomm and its customers to work through the inventory levels from here.Long-term trends are favorable for Qualcomm. Customers are increasing their Qualcomm content levels. This will increase its license revenue. In addition, the average selling price is rising. This will keep Qualcomm’s gross margins at strong levels.This chip maker could post strong EPS growth in 2023. The OEM inventory drawdown could clear in as little as one quarter. Long-term investors who get QCOM stock at a discount will benefit when the market improves. Thus, this is one of the discounted tech stocks to buy.Twilio (TWLO)Twilio Inc (TWLO) logo displayed on mobile phone hidden in jeans pocketSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comTwilio (NYSE:TWLO) plunged by 35% on Nov. 4 after posting Q3 results a day earlier. Despite revenue growing by 32.8% Y/Y, it lost $457 million on a GAAP basis.Twilio needs to turn one-time transaction deals into long-term customer relationships. It will do so by demonstrating why communications and data are better together. The company needs to show its customers that engagement increases with Twilio’s solution.The company is betting that Twilio Engage will improve customer engagement levels. Engage integrates a customer data platform with a communications API. It will need time to convince investors that customers will buy the Engage platform.Twilio has a healthy balance sheet. It has $4.2 billion in cash. It can buy back shares, seek merger and acquisition opportunities, or invest in research and development. Before it acquires any firm, it will need to achieve non-GAAP profitability in 2023. Investors are more likely to buy this discounted tech stock when the company is not losing money.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

35,48a1359d-8f79-3a47-bcd5-80abc8f70843,CCI,2022-11-13,Selling US$3.7m worth of stock earlier this year was a lucrative decision for Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) insiders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-3-7m-worth-120023484.html,1668340823,STORY,['CCI'],"[Even though Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) stock gained 8.0% last week, insiders who sold US$3.7m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Selling at an average price of US$190, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Crown Castle Crown Castle Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP &amp; COO of Fiber, Christopher Levendos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$193 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$140. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 5.91k shares for US$843k. On the other hand they divested 19.50k shares, for US$3.7m. In total, Crown Castle insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The sellers received a price of around US$190, on average. It is certainly not great to see that insiders have sold shares in the company. However, we do note that the average sale price was significantly higher than the current share price (which is US$140). You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Crown Castle better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Crown Castle Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Crown Castle insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$397k for shares in the company -- and none sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Story continuesDoes Crown Castle Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Crown Castle insiders own about US$337m worth of shares (which is 0.6% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Crown Castle Insiders?The recent insider purchases are heartening. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The recent buying by some insiders , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Crown Castle insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Crown Castle has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Several key states are still tabulating their votes, but it does seem likely that the Republican Party will win back control of, at least, the House of Representatives.That means the country will have a divided government, which is historically good news for stocks. The reasons for that are best left for others to debate, but history is undefeated. In the 19 mid-term elections since World War II, stocks have gained in the following 12 months after every single one, and usually by a healthy amount.Of course, it’s always possible that 2023 could be different, but I wouldn’t be so sure. The wheels of government move slowly at all times, particularly when you have two parties that can’t be much more divided than they are at the moment. Government spending is likely to slow down, and that may be music to the Federal Reserve’s ears.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat still doesn’t mean you can just throw a dart at any stock and make a profit. You still need a game plan. Here are seven stocks that should allow you to cash in on the 2022 midterm elections.MSFTMicrosoft$225.66PANWPalo Alto Networks$152.82EPDEnterprise Product Partners$24.56XOMExxon Mobil$109.92RSGRepublic Services$132.49NTRNutrien$75.16MCDMcDonald’s$278.57Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has not been immune to the tech wreck. MSFT stock is down more than 32% in 2022. For many investors, rising interest rates and expectations for lower consumer and business spending make the tech sector a no-go right now.That being said, Microsoft is hovering just above its 52-week low at the time of this writing. The company continues to grow its quarterly earnings on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for FY 2022 came in at just under $200 billion. And the company’s first-quarter results for fiscal year 2023 put it on pace to eclipse that mark. All of which suggests that investors are selling MSFT stock based more on expectations than reality.Story continuesPlus, MSFT stock still receives a consensus buy from analysts, pays a safe and growing dividend, and has strong fundamentals including healthy free cash flow based on healthy profit margins. All of this suggests that coming out of the 2022 midterm elections, Microsoft will be a bellwether stock when the market turns around.Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comPalo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is a leading provider of internet security solutions with an international roster of enterprise customers, including 85 out of the Fortune 100. Cybersecurity will remain an essential part of every business, particularly at the enterprise level.In the last several years, Palo Alto has enhanced its lineup of next-generation security offerings. And in the last five years, Palo Alto has grown average revenue by approximately 25% per year and average earnings by approximately 5% per year.That average earnings growth is projected to double in the next five years. This may be due, in part, because the company believes it only has about 6% of its total addressable market.Palo Alto Networks closed out its fiscal year in August and proved why it’s one of the leading names in the space. The company reports that subscription and support revenue now is more than 80% of its billings.That’s the kind of metric that analysts and investors love because it means that the company has predictable revenue. As evidence of that, PANW stock currently has a consensus price target of $231.85 which is more than 50% above its price.Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comRegardless of the outcome of the election, the energy sector will remain a key sector to watch in 2023, and one of the key areas to watch will be natural gas. If that’s the case, Enterprise Product Partners (NYSE:EPD) is one to watch.As a midstream operator Enterprise Product Partners is responsible for transporting natural gas across the country via its expansive pipeline network that covers over 50,000 miles. Investors like the company’s consistent revenue that it generates via contracts. This means slow, steady growth that can be a source of comfort in times of volatility.But where Enterprise Product Partners shines is in its structure as a master limited partnership (MLP). This requires it to pay out a substantial amount of profit as a dividend, reflected in its more-than 7.6% yield. It also has increased its dividend for 24 consecutive years which puts it one year away from becoming a dividend aristocrat.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comNo matter what the final outcome of the 2022 midterm elections, fossil fuels will remain in the spotlight. Whether that will be good for traditional oil and gas stocks is anybody’s guess. The point I’d like to make is that it really doesn’t matter.Traditional oil and gas stocks such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) deserve a spot in your portfolio for two reasons. First, the world is going to need fossil fuels in order to build the infrastructure that the world needs for new energy.Just as important, the company is also actively investing in renewable energy. One of its specific investments is renewable diesel, which is becoming increasingly important as diesel fuel supplies are at historic lows.Exxon Mobil just delivered a strong quarter with net earnings coming in at a record $18.7 billion. That comes out to $4.45 per share on revenue of $112 billion.XOM stock is up 44% in the last 12 months and is near its all-time high.

Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) generated over $11 billion in revenue last year, and it’s on pace to continue growing revenue and earnings in the next five years. That will keep the company’s dividend safe and growing, which is something it’s done for the last 18 consecutive years.Coming out of the 2022 midterm elections, there’s more to like about Republic Services than the notion of predictable revenue and earnings. According to the Upright Project, the company has a net impact ratio of 43.7%. This is a measure of sustainability impact that is popular with ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investors.RSG stock is trading in the middle of its 52-week range with some analysts projecting a 13% upside. Still, the combination of growing earnings and a healthy dividend makes RSG a solid choice for investors looking for stocks that are likely to outperform after the 2022 midterm elections.NutrienA photo of Nutrien's (NTR) website, with a magnifying glass over the logo.Source: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.comEarly in 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought stark warnings of possible food shortages in 2023.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cigna The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.18bUS$10.6bUS$8.32bUS$8.67bUS$8.67bUS$8.72bUS$8.81bUS$8.92bUS$9.06bUS$9.20bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.02%Est @ 0.58%Est @ 1%Est @ 1.29%Est @ 1.5%Est @ 1.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$7.7kUS$9.3kUS$6.9kUS$6.7kUS$6.3kUS$5.9kUS$5.6kUS$5.3kUS$5.1kUS$4.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$64bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$200bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$200b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$105bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$169b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$304, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cigna as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.913. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

To skip our detailed analysis of the global economic outlook in 2022, go directly and see 5 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now.The global macroeconomic outlook continues to be in free-fall, with an increasingly grim outlook for the rest of 2022 and a below-trend growth forecast for 2023. According to the latest report by the International Monetary Fund, with winters approaching, an energy crisis looms large over the European continent, and is coupled with skyrocketing costs of living, a sharp tightening of global financial conditions, and an economic slowdown in China. These factors are adding to the headwinds perpetrated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February and the subsequent supply chain disruptions; surging inflation and high interest rates, and soaring fuel prices, to drive the dimmed growth outlook, with the report predicting that the possibility of a recession in 2023 seems more apparent than ever.According to baseline forecasts conducted by Euromonitor International, real GDP growth for Q4 2022 is set to decline to 1.7% by the end of 2022, and 0.8% in 2023. This points to a deceleration of 0.8 and 0.5 percentage points  respectively, relative to the preceding quarter as most negative growth drivers still remain dominant. The U.S. Federal Reserve's predatory monetary policies are expected to help curb inflation to an extent, but also take a heavy toll on investment and economic activity. Furthermore, exports in the United States are losing steam amid flailing external demand. As winter approaches, Europe is staring down the barrel of Putin's gun in the shape of a massive energy crisis. Price hikes are hitting manufacturers and households hard, and business, investment, and consumer confidence is on the decline. The Eurozone economy is set to significantly slow down to 0.6% in 2023. Germany is widely forecasted to enter a recession in the coming quarters, and though rebounding tourism may provide temporary relief to certain European economies, the long-term prospects do not seem favorable.  According to the report, as more economies delve deeper into a recession in 2023, the year is anticipated to be exceptionally tough for investors, businesses, and consumers alike. There are only a few countries that are thriving in this environment (see the 15 fastest growing economies in 2022).Story continuesHowever, even in the midst of such grim macroeconomic conditions, there is opportunity for long-term investors, who are looking for the best depressed stocks to shield themselves from incurring massive losses. A depressed stock is undervalued in comparison to other similar stocks in the same industry and is trading at a price thought to be significantly below its intrinsic value. In this article, we have outlined 12 of the best depressed stocks to buy now, including some mega-cap stocks that are facing temporary headwinds.Our MethodologyWe picked stocks that are currently down 20% or more year-to-date (as of November 9) but show catalysts for strong long-term growth, due to factors like positive analyst ratings, solid financials, and significant growth predictions. These stocks provide attractive entry points for long-term investors. The stocks have been ranked according to the number of hedge funds which hold stakes in them, from lowest to highest.Insider Monkey’s extensive database tracking 895 elite hedge funds in Q2 2022 was used to gauge hedge fund sentiment around each stock.12 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now12. Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 30 YTD Decline (As of November 9): 21.05%Based in Richmond, Virginia, Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) is a North American power and energy company which supplies electric power and natural gas to multiple U.S. states, including Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. As of Q3 2022, the company beat EPS estimates of $1.08 by $0.03, generating earnings of $1.11 per share. Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) also posted a total revenue of $4.39 billion in Q3 2022. Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) is one of the best depressed stocks to buy.On October 31, Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza lowered the price target on Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) to $75 from $90, maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Although the analyst lowered the baseline utility valuations across the board due to skyrocketing interest rates and forward yield expectations, he also refreshed certain selected estimates from the Q3 earnings season from the Power and Utilities sector to reflect well-known and measurable year-over-year items. This was done to  adjust for seasonality and to realign the stock according to the latest commodity curves.11. Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 36 YTD Decline (As of November 9): 38.69%Headquartered in Irving, Texas, Celanese Corp. (NYSE:CE) is an American technology and specialty materials company which is one of the world's largest producers of acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer. The company operates more than 25 production plants and six research centers in 11 countries globally. As of the second quarter of 2022, Celanese Corp. (NYSE:CE) has managed to maintain investor interest, with 36 funds long the stock in Q1 and Q2 of 2022. Furthermore, the company generated a total revenue of $2.3 billion in Q3 2022.On November 10, Deutsche Bank analyst David Begleiter lowered the price target on Celanese Corp. (NYSE:CE) to $130 from $150, maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that although the company is currently battling headwinds around the macroeconomic outlook and leverage, Celanese's (NYSE:CE) has the right management team which is creating opportunities and value in the global business platform. The company's low valuation is currently providing the perfect entry point for long-term investors, and according to Begleiter, Celanese's (NYSE:CE) Mobility and Materials acquisition is perfectly geared to achieve higher profitability. Furthermore, the company is a dividend payer, with an annual dividend yield of 2.68% and a quarterly dividend amount of $0.70.Here is what Vltava Fund had to say about Celanese Corp. (NYSE:CE) in their Q1 2022 investor letter:“We then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stocks of Celanese (CE).Celanese is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and its chemical derivatives, including vinyl acetate monomers and emulsions. Their applications are used in a wide range of industries, such as automotive tobacco, coatings, construction, energy, telecommunications, food, and medical. Celanese recently closed the acquisition of a large part of DuPont’s business, which will make Celanese an even bigger player in the industry while reducing the cyclicality of it business. The acquisition is quite large and should deliver significant value to shareholders that in our view is not at all presently reflected in the share price. Celanese is a business that stands more or less aside from the main interests of most investors, but it is a company with very high returns on capital, strong free cash flow, and historically very efficient resource allocation.”10. Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 45YTD Decline (As of November 9): 28.82%Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company which focuses on RNA therapeutics, primarily mRNA vaccines. As of Q2 2022, hedge fund sentiment around Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) increased, with 45 funds long the stock, up from 41 in the preceding quarter.On November 7, Chardan analyst Geulah Livshits lowered the price target on Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) to $186 from $188, keeping a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst attributed the rating to the company's stellar Q3 2022 returns and reiterated that upcoming data readouts from its respiratory and personalized cancer vaccine program are expected by the end of 2022. While the company's near term valuation in predominantly attributable to COVID, there are multiple modalities and programs currently in pipeline, which possess relevant catalysts that are well-leveraged to support long-term growth, especially as evidence of concepts emerge.9. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 46 YTD Decline (As of November 9): 35.12%Based in Dearborn, Michigan, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is an American multinational automobile manufacturer which specializes in the manufacture and sale of automobiles, commercial vehicles, and luxury cars. As of the third quarter of 2022, the company beat EPS estimates of $0.27 by $0.03, posting earnings of $0.30 per share. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has also managed to maintain hedge fund sentiment around the stock as of Q2 2022, with 46 hedge funds long the stock in Q1 and Q2 of 2022. The stock is a huge dividend payer, with an annual dividend yield of 4.23% compared to the Auto and Truck Manufacturers industry mean of 0.0%. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has been a regular dividend payer since 1973, having a quarterly dividend amount of $0.15.Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) is undervalued at its current valuation. The company's Q3 2022 bottom line has beat market expectations, with investors holding a favorable outlook on the company's latest earnings beat. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) management lifted its free cash flow guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022, and revisited its 2022 EBIT guidance, maintaining that it completely outshined market expectations. The company's revenue rose by a reasonably strong 10% year-over-year, as of the third quarter of 2022, posting $39.4 billion against consensus $36.25 billion. The company also exudes brand loyalty, which adds considerably to overall value of the stock. And although macroeconomic pressures and inflationary risks persist, the company's favorable history of high dividend payouts and valuation metrics could potentially attract long-term investors into a bargain purchase.Here is what Leaven Partners had to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in their Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 47 YTD Decline (As of November 9): 30.68%Based in Veldhoven, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch multinational corporation which specializes in the the development and manufacturing of photolithography machines, which are essential in the production of computer chips. As of 2022, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is the largest semiconductor  supplier in the industry.On November 8, Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson initiated coverage of ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) with an Overweight rating and a $665.8 price target. According to the analyst, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is a defensive play within the cyclical semiconductor industry and the high-quality brand name dominated the lithography system supply market, which will shield the company from macroeconomic pressures and high interest rates. The company's Q3 2022 returns were extremely favorable, completely outperforming expectations and showing strong indicators for growth. As of Q3 2022, the company's backlog also increased due to record sales, which points to strong demand for the company's product. And although the stock is currently depressed, strong fundamentals, positive analyst sentiment around the stock, and an annual dividend yield of 1.16% make it an ideal pick for long-term investors.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about ASML Holding's (NASDAQ:ASML) solid fundamentals in their Q2 2022 investor letter:“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”7. Bath &amp; Body Works LLC (NYSE:BBWI)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 47 YTD Decline (As of November 9): 51.15%Based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, Bath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) is an American retail store chain that specializes in the production and sale of personal hygiene products, cosmetics, fragrances, and candles. Since the company's inception in 1990, it has expanded across 6 continents and is currently the largest bath shop chain in the United States. As of Q3 2022, Bath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) posted an EPS of $0.52, beating estimates of $0.47 by $0.05. This is largely attributed to the company's streamlined approach towards production and program development. The stock is also a huge dividend payer, with an annual dividend yield of 2.32% and a quarterly dividend amount of $0.20.On October 21, Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans assumed coverage of Bath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI), lowering a price target on the stock from $47 to $43 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the market for beauty brands is undergoing a quick shift but so far, beauty products have withstood the underlying shift from goods to services by remaining connected to socialization, occasions, and self-care regimens. The analyst forecasted a high-single digit percentage year-over-year sale across mass and prestige, and majority of the increase being attributed to the company's strong pricing model. Furthermore, Helgans maintains that the brand commands strong consumer loyalty and recognition within the market, and is significantly less vulnerable to inflationary and supply chain pressures compared to other players in the game. Therefore, she ascertains that like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), the company's discounted valuation is not justified and is a bargain for the right investor.6. Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 72 YTD Decline (As of November 9): 40.28%Headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an American multinational corporations which primarily specializes in the design, development, manufacturing, global marketing, and sale of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. As of Q2 2022, hedge fund sentiment around the company increased, with 72 funds long the stock, up from 67 in the preceding quarter. Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) also beat EPS estimates of $0.92 by $0.01, posting earnings of $0.93 per share.On October 29, Raymond James analyst Rick Patel initiated coverage of Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) with an Outperform rating and a $99 price target. The analyst contends that since the stock underperformed in the market in 2022, the market has de-risked the company's valuations in anticipation of a recession. However, the company's China segment is widely expected to rematerialize, with profits showing signs of rebound. Deutsche Bank has also reiterated its confidence in China's economy in Q4 2022, and since a China recovery can mitigate economic headwinds in the U.S, Patel remains positively confident that Nike's (NYSE:NKE) current discounted valuation can provide an excellent entry point to long-term investors.Here is what Leaven Partners had to say about Nike's(NYSE:NKE) long-term prospects in their Q3 2022 investor letter:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now.   Suggested Articles:13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To BuyStocks That Will Double in 2023Goldman Sachs Semiconductor Stocks Disclosure: none. 12 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey:]"

(NASDAQ:PYPL) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.74bUS$7.84bUS$8.41bUS$8.15bUS$8.03bUS$7.99bUS$8.02bUS$8.08bUS$8.17bUS$8.29bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -1.47%Est @ -0.44%Est @ 0.29%Est @ 0.8%Est @ 1.15%Est @ 1.4% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$6.3kUS$6.8kUS$6.8kUS$6.1kUS$5.6kUS$5.2kUS$4.8kUS$4.5kUS$4.3kUS$4.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$54bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$155bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$155b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$75bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$130b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$91.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PayPal Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.065. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The return on their investment would have been much higher had they held on to their stock.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Del Bene, for US$222k worth of shares, at about US$139 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$143). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 9.6% of Robert Del Bene's stake. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Robert Del Bene.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 1.08k shares worth US$135k. On the other hand they divested 1.60k shares, for US$222k. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At International Business Machines Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at International Business Machines. Specifically, Independent Director David Farr bought US$125k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of International Business MachinesAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. International Business Machines insiders own about US$102m worth of shares (which is 0.08% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At International Business Machines Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that International Business Machines insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with International Business Machines (including 1 which is concerning).If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Snap-on investors that purchase the stock on or after the 18th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 9th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.62 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.48 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Snap-on has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current stock price of $234.31. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Snap-on's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Snap-on has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Snap-on Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Snap-on paid out a comfortable 34% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 50% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Snap-on's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Snap-on's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Snap-on has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayHas Snap-on got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that Snap-on is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.So while Snap-on looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Snap-on and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Given the increased affordability of technology, it is estimated that there could be 7.5 billion internet users by 2030.With so many internet users and also so many computers and smartphones, some tech companies listed on the Nasdaq Composite Index have achieved enormous scale and realize significant profits.Nasdaq Composite Index &amp; NASDAQ ExchangeWhen it comes to NASDAQ, there is an index commonly known in the media as 'the NASDAQ' that is also known as the Nasdaq Composite Index.The Nasdaq Composite Index includes all domestic and international common type stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As of November, The Nasdaq Composite Index covers over 2,500 stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock market. As a result of its market capitalization weighting method, some stocks account for a far bigger portion of the index versus other stocks.NASDAQ can also refer to the Nasdaq Stock Market, which is one of the two largest stock exchanges in the United States along with the NYSE.2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in 2022 alone and many expect the central bank to raise rates even further. As a result of the rate increases, substantial capital has moved from the stock market to Treasuries given the higher yields.Story continuesWith the capital movement along with the potential for an economic slowdown in 2023 given the interest rate increases, the Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen 28.5% year to date as of November 11. As a result of the decrease, some leading stocks in the index trade for fairly low valuations.Nevertheless, if economic data doesn't meet expectations, the Nasdaq Composite Index could decrease further. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many sectors.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable NASDAQ Companies in the World, we took the top 15 stocks by market capitalization from the Nasdaq Composite Index and ranked them from #15 to #1.15 Most Valuable NASDAQ Companies in the World15.

Selling at an average price of US$289, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Sean Major, sold US$1.7m worth of shares at a price of US$289 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$288. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Sean Major.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Air Products and Chemicals insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$225m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Air Products and Chemicals Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Air Products and Chemicals insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Air Products and Chemicals you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

""Right now, because of the unique position we’re in, that we have liquidity and a lot of our competitors do not, I think we're going to be able to actually pick up more very fine locations and do it at bargain basement prices.""Movie theaters tried a range of strategies to reengage customers after pandemic shutdowns and a surge in direct-to-consumer entertainment that prompted some studios to release box office titles directly on streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX), HBO Max (WBD), and Disney+ (DIS).But a weak box office lineup in the third quarter didn’t make that comeback story any easier for the industry, despite the best efforts of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in ""Black Adam.""A photograph of a closed movie theater in small town America (Getty Images).""There are a number of smaller movie circuits that are in real trouble because they didn't raise the kind of money that we raised during the pandemic,"" Aron said. ""And they're running on fumes.""AMC capitalized on the visibility it received after a short squeeze briefly catapulted the stock in January 2021. The movie theater chain executed strategically timed equity offerings to raise additional cash.""AMC raised a lot of money in 2020 and 2021,"" Aron said. ""We raised $2.25 billion by selling stock into the marketplace.

(FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)Nevertheless, the CEO's willingness to spend on theater locations is counterbalanced by AMC's own closures of underperforming venues. Since the pandemic began, AMC has reduced its footprint by 57 locations overall, closing 106 locations and opening 49 new venues.Story continuesThat hasn't deterred Aron, who sees a connection point for moviegoers returning to the theater experience as well as a larger addressable market through new investments, which include a mining company, AMC-branded credit cards, and a recent partnership with Zoom (ZM).""We think that's going to be a real boost for our meetings business,"" Aron said on the company's Zoom Rooms partnership, adding: ""that's the next one to come after our investment last winter in Hycroft, the gold and silver mine out in Nevada.""Correction: A previous version of this article erroneously stated that Cineworld, which recently declared bankruptcy, owns Cinemark.

With 80% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Colgate-Palmolive. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Colgate-Palmolive. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Colgate-Palmolive's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Colgate-Palmolive. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.8% and 5.9% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$63m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Colgate-Palmolive. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Selling at an average price of US$44.50, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ComcastThe Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$397k worth of shares at a price of US$44.50 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$34.02. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. Daniel Murdock was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of ComcastFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$1.3b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Comcast Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Comcast shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Comcast insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - Comcast has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Story continuesBut note: Comcast may not be the best stock to buy.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Oracle The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$13.4bUS$16.1bUS$19.6bUS$21.0bUS$22.0bUS$22.8bUS$23.6bUS$24.3bUS$25.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x16Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.8%Est @ 3.95%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$10.1kUS$11.4kUS$12.7kUS$14.3kUS$14.1kUS$13.7kUS$13.1kUS$12.6kUS$11.9kUS$11.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$125bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$408bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$408b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$185bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$311b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$77.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.215. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology Micron Technology's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Micron Technology has grown EPS by 13% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Micron Technology is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.0 percentage points to 32%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Micron Technology's future profits.Story continuesAre Micron Technology Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Micron Technology, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$212m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is Micron Technology Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Micron Technology is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Even so, be aware that  Micron Technology is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Although Micron Technology certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

You Have Four Days Left,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interested-tractor-supplys-nasdaq-tsco-120403842.html,1668341043.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Tractor Supply's shares before the 18th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.92 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.68 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Tractor Supply has a trailing yield of approximately 1.8% on its current stock price of $209.05. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Tractor Supply has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Tractor Supply Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Tractor Supply's payout ratio is modest, at just 35% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 187% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.Tractor Supply paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Tractor Supply to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Tractor Supply has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing quickly, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Tractor Supply has delivered 31% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpHas Tractor Supply got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We like that Tractor Supply has been successfully growing its earnings per share at a nice rate and reinvesting most of its profits in the business. However, we note the high cashflow payout ratio with some concern. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Tractor Supply's dividend merits.While it's tempting to invest in Tractor Supply for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, Tractor Supply has 4 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

70,90e71f2a-0e47-3037-a4c8-144cead447d7,VRTX,2022-11-13,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 63% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporateds-nasdaq-vrtx-130033426.html,1668344433,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.57bUS$4.95bUS$5.40bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.26bUS$6.47bUS$6.67bUS$6.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.2%Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$160bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$160b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$127b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$303, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.850. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Vertex Pharmaceuticals, we've put together three important elements you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Vertex Pharmaceuticals , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does VRTX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Norfolk Southern is:25% = US$3.2b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.25 in profit.Does Norfolk Southern Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Norfolk Southern has a similar ROE to the average in the Transportation industry classification (25%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesNorfolk Southern's Debt And Its 25% ROENorfolk Southern clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.20. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

74,41e28e70-9161-3992-acf1-f8333d733acd,SYK,2022-11-13,Stryker (NYSE:SYK) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stryker-nyse-syk-stock-performs-120044894.html,1668340844,STORY,['SYK'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 44% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 15% in the last year.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Stryker While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Stryker achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.4% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 8% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Stryker has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Stryker's TSR for the last 5 years was 53%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Stryker returned a loss of 14% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 20%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 9% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Stryker , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

75,5ea32e51-ae85-38c6-b73a-7ce32f6cd2e2,LKQ,2022-11-13,Should You Be Adding LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-lkq-nasdaq-lkq-watchlist-130337170.html,1668344617,STORY,['LKQ'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for LKQ How Quickly Is LKQ Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. LKQ's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 46%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It was a year of stability for LKQ as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of LKQ's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre LKQ Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since LKQ has a market capitalisation of US$15b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$115m. This comes in at 0.8% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to LKQ, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.LKQ offered total compensation worth US$9.4m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is LKQ Worth Keeping An Eye On?LKQ's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. LKQ certainly ticks a few boxes, so we think it's probably well worth further consideration. Even so, be aware that  LKQ is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ADP) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of January to $1.25. This makes the dividend yield 2.0%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Automatic Data Processing's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Automatic Data Processing was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 40.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 47%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendAutomatic Data Processing Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.58 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $5.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Automatic Data Processing has impressed us by growing EPS at 13% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.We Really Like Automatic Data Processing's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

These low-priced shares are trading at record lows, and you could pick a bunch of them for just a $100 bill. Investors are always on the lookout for a good deal, and with so many cheap stocks available in the current bear market, it’s an ideal time to build a robust long-term portfolio. With stocks at multi-year lows, you can find a fair number of cheap stocks to buy for $100.Multiple stocks have shed a ton of value due to their weakening fundamentals and future outlooks. On the flip side, we have a fair few stocks that have been swept away by the bear market despite boasting incredible fundamentals. Doing your due diligence on which cheap stocks are best seems daunting, but don’t worry; we have you covered! Without further ado, let’s look at seven of the top cheap stocks to buy for $100.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCheap Stocks to Buy for $100: AvePoint (AVPT)In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) productsSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comAvePoint (NASDAQ:AVPT) is a software-as-a-service business offering various services such as data management, protection, and migration in Microsoft Office 365. It went public last year following a merger with shell Apex Technology Acquisition. Like other SPAC companies, its stock has been pummeled at the market this year, and it trades at just three times forward sales.AvePoint facilitates the ease of use and user experience of Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) products. Though Microsoft could produce these services in-house, it’s been more profitable for the business to outsource these services to firms such as AvePoint. This is evidenced in stellar late results for AvePoint, where it’s generated double-digit revenue growth with over a 100% net retention rate. Microsoft sees AvePoint as a firm that has helped expand its overall addressable market, which bodes well for AVPT stock over the long term.Story continuesNokia (NOK)a backdrop featuring the Nokia logo with a mobile phone featuring the Nokia logo on its screen in the foregroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comNokia (NYSE:NOK) has come a long way from a struggling smartphone marker to a leading telecommunications player. It continues to execute its turnaround plans effectively, reporting stellar top-line expansion across its core business segments. Its network infrastructure and cloud segments have demonstrated spectacular growth in the past several quarters and continue to push Nokia ahead in the 5G race.It recently reported its third-quarter results, where its sales increased by 16% from the prior-year period and a comparable earnings growth of 19%. Moreover, it’s making a habit of beating analyst estimates, with the third quarter being the eighth consecutive time it’s beaten analyst estimates. Moreover, the firm has done remarkably well in diversifying its customer base and growing its enterprise sales. Revenues from the enterprise segment have soared roughly 50% since 2018. Overall, NOK stock is considerably cheap relative to its immense growth potential and is poised for long-term success.Cheap Stocks to Buy for $100: Ambev (ABEV)website image for ambevSource: Anton Garin / Shutterstock.comAmbev (NYSE:ABEV) is the South American arm of the world’s top brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev SA (NYSE:BUD). It’s been sluggish in bouncing back from the pandemic-led headwinds; however, recent results point to a resurgence. The beer market in Brazil has been resilient and has helped Ambev post strong results of late. Moreover, with the FIFA World Cup coming up, its brands will likely witness strong momentum.It is imperative, though, for Ambev to improve its sales volume to take pressure off prices. As we advance, its core markets will remain robust, resulting in incredible sales for the foreseeable future. Its cash flows need to protect its dividend, though, but it is unlikely to be cut given its incredible liquidity positioning.American Airlines (AAL)An American Airlines (AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks.Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is among the top legacy carriers in the U.S. that were on the brink of bankruptcy during the height of the pandemic. However, the tables have turned completely, with AAL benefitting from the massive pent-up demand for travel in the post-pandemic world. Its recent quarterly results have been tremendous and point to more upside ahead for the business.AAL recently reported its third-quarter results, where its revenues soared over 50%. Moreover, its occupancy levels nearly matched pre-pandemic levels, showing that the pandemic no longer impacts travel plans. Additionally, the company is executing its plans to pay down $15 billion of its debt by the conclusion of 2025. AAL is excellently growing sales, limiting costs, and executing well in the Latin American region. All the while, its stock still trades at just 0.2 times forward sales.Cheap Stocks to Buy for $100: SoFi Technologies (SOFI)SoFi Technologies corporate building shown next to neighboring skyscraper during the daytimeSource: shutterstock.com/Michael ViSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) operates as a personal finance business that has made amazing strides in expanding its burgeoning ecosystem. It has seen incredible momentum in its customer and lending segment, and the resumption of student loans will be a major catalyst for EBITDA expansion. Despite a phenomenal outlook, its shares have taken a major haircut and now boast a significantly better risk/reward trade-off.Its third-quarter results show a 50% bump in its top line, and the rock-solid growth was due to product innovation and the increase in its products and services. It wrapped up the third quarter with 4.7 million customer accounts, a 424,000 increase on a sequential basis. Based on its results, it should speed past five million accounts by the end of the year, leading to meaningful improvement in its stock price.Nio (NIO)NIO booth showroom in Shanghai Pudong International Auto Show. Car exhibition and vehicle promotion. Auto business and economy staff with mask coronavirus periodSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.comNio (NYSE:NIO) has been the most popular Chinese electric vehicle (EV) stock, soaring to record heights over the past few years. It has grown its deliveries by triple-digit margins in a short amount of time and has now become an EV juggernaut. Macroeconomic troubles and its Covid-19-led disruptions have weighed down its business this year, resulting in its stock plummeting over 70%.It would appear that Nio was past its supply-chain woes delivering record deliveries in the past couple of months. However, another production disruption has likely ended investors’ hopes of seeing a record fourth quarter. Nevertheless, I feel investors focus too much on the short-term and ignore its incredible long-term potential in the sphere. There’s plenty to look forward to with Nio, including new models and its foray into Europe to ignore the stock at current price levels.Cheap Stocks to Buy for $100: The Original Bark Company (BARK)a BarkBox logo is seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThe Original Bark Company (NYSE:BARK) sells its popular branded product line to dog owners. The budding pet business generates the bulk of its sales through direct-to-consumer subscription boxes, a model that has proven to be profitable and consistent. It’s moving towards profitability briskly, with its management cutting operational expenses by healthy margins each quarter.BARK’s subscription business is generating incredible fundamentals, and its management reports that customer acquisition costs haven’t increased much in recent quarters. Moreover, it operates in a typically stable sector through recessions, which suggests it won’t have much of a problem navigating the current economic climate. Moreover, cross-selling opportunities through new and existing products will further expand its revenue base and improve profitability.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton Eaton Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, April Boise, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$139 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$162). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 43% of April Boise's stake.All up, insiders sold more shares in Eaton than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Eaton Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Eaton. In total, insiders sold US$1.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Eaton insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$229m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Eaton Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Eaton stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Eaton makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Eaton. For example - Eaton has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn around. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Does Growth Match The P/E?The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 24%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 155% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 7.1% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.4% growth each year, that's a disappointing outcome.With this information, we find it concerning that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals currently trades on a higher than expected P/E for a company whose earnings are forecast to decline. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings are unlikely to support a more positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Having said that, be aware  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

84,cc5fc82c-131e-3e1e-bae3-e1ab6f4f2708,UNP,2022-11-13,Getting In Cheap On Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) Is Unlikely,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/getting-cheap-union-pacific-corporation-130040604.html,1668344440,STORY,['UNP'],"[Union Pacific Corporation's  (NYSE:UNP) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 19.8x might make it look like a sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Union Pacific has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific peKeen to find out how analysts think Union Pacific's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Union Pacific would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 20%. As a result, it also grew EPS by 29% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 7.3% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.2% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.In light of this, it's curious that Union Pacific's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.The Bottom Line On Union Pacific's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesOur examination of Union Pacific's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Union Pacific   you should know about.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.
