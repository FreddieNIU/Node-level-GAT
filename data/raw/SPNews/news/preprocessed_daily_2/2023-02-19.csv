And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 88% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Unum Group, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Unum Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Unum Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Unum Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Unum Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Unum Group is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.8% and 9.0% of the stock.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 9 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Unum GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Unum Group insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$47m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

With 87% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company.

Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Edwards Lifesciences. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Edwards Lifesciences?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index.

This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Edwards Lifesciences' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.5% of the company stock.

The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Edwards LifesciencesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$408m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Edwards Lifesciences.

Personal income and spending data on Friday will give more insight into price pressures, while earnings from major retailers will shed some light on how consumers are faring amid soaring prices. The Eurozone is to release flash PMI data and testimony from the incoming Bank of Japan governor may give more insight into his monetary policy stance. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.1. Fed minutesOn Wednesday the Fed is to publish the minutes of its January meeting, when it scaled back the pace of interest rate hikes to 25 basis points after a year of outsize increases.Since then, data has shown the decline in the annual rate of inflation has stalled while producer prices rose by the most in seven months in January.Together with a strong U.S. jobs report for January, the data has prompted investors to reevaluate expectations for how high the Fed will ultimately raise rates. They now see the federal funds rate peaking above 5.2% in July, according to interest-rate futures.The minutes may give investors some insight into the appetite for a larger hike at the Fed’s upcoming March meeting after recent comments from some policymakers indicated support for such a move.U.S. dataThe U.S. is to release what will be closely watched personal income and spending data on Friday, which contains the Fed’s favored inflation gauge - the core personal consumption expenditures price index.The economic calendar also includes updates on both new and existing home sales for January, along with revised data on fourth quarter gross domestic product and the weekly report on initial jobless claims.Meanwhile, New York Fed president John Williams is to speak about inflation at an event on Wednesday.3. Retail earningsAs an underwhelming fourth-quarter earnings season comes to an end, results from major retailers will give an insight into the strength of consumer spending amid soaring prices - a critical topic for investors.Story continuesWalmart (NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer by sales along with home improvement giant Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are set to report on Tuesday and will ""set the stage for everyone else,"" according to JPMorgan retail analysts.""We expect HD and WMT’s tone on guidance and the consumer to be cautious at best,"" the JPMorgan analysts wrote in an earnings preview note last week. They rate Walmart shares ""neutral"" and Home Depot as ""overweight.""Discount retailer TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) reports Wednesday and beyond the retail sector chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and e-commerce firm eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), will also report in the coming week.4. Eurozone PMIsThe highlight of the week in the Eurozone economic calendar will be Tuesday’s flash PMI data for February, which will show how well the economy is performing after unexpectedly growing in the final quarter of 2022.If improving business conditions are contributing to rising price pressures, this could bolster expectations for the European Central Bank to keep raising interest rates given persistently high inflation.Germany’s Ifo Business Climate Index on Wednesday will show how the region’s largest economy is weathering the energy crisis, with economists expecting signs of recovery to continue at low levels.The bloc is also to release final inflation figures for January on Thursday, which will be in focus after delayed German data was omitted from the first estimate.5. BOJ testimonyLeadership of the BOJ is in transition to academic Kazuo Ueda, who is expected to succeed current Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, when his second five-year term ends in April.The incoming BOJ governor is to testify, along with his two would-be deputies, to the lower house of parliament on Friday.While Ueda is a dove, investors expect his tenure to end yield curve controls.

Wall Street has closely watched the sportsbook operator's path to profitability for years and on Friday DraftKings announced its increased focus on cost-cutting will cause the company to lose less money in 2023 than initially anticipated. All of this coming while the company continues to report record revenue amid increased gambling legalization.""Our revenue was better than our prior guidance, primarily because of structural improvement in our Sportsbook hold and fundamentally better customer trends than we expected,""DraftKings CFO Jason Park told investors on Friday. ""Customers are engaging more with our products and are less relying on promotions.""DraftKings positive results didn't have much impact on the sector as a whole as MGM Resorts International (MGM), Penn Entertainment (PENN), Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) had muted stock reactions on Friday.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Dave Briggs discuss from DraftKings' fourth quarter earnings call.Key Video takeaways:0:15 DraftKings key numbers0:25 Hear from DraftKings CFO Jason Park1:00 Where DraftKings sits in the growth cycle1:20 Wall Street's reactions to DraftKings results2:00 How DraftKings compares to competitorsVideo TranscriptSEANA SMITH: A lot of earnings to sift through, so let's talk about some of the biggest movers, some of the biggest stories that we've covered this week. First up, DraftKings a huge mover today. Look at that-- a jump of just about 15%. The sports betting company soaring after beating revenue estimates for the fourth quarter, also narrowing its expected loss for 2023. Here's CFO Jason Park on what drove the company's success to end the year.JASON PARK: Our revenue was better than our prior guidance primarily because of structural improvement in our sportsbook hold and fundamentally better customer trends than we expected. Customers are engaging more with our products and are less reliant on promotions.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Certainly did help those results here, that DraftKings able to spend less on promotions. Sounds like they're building towards profitability, something that we know the Street certainly cares about, puts more of an emphasis on when we talk about these type of companies at this point in their maturity cycle. But those numbers and the growth numbers that they put up this past quarter were extremely impressive, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: It's incredible. It feels like the third quarter. We're not quite in the fourth, but the third for DraftKings. To your point, revenues up 80% year over year. Active members up 30% year over year. And I looked at a couple of notes here. And you talked about the different reasons to like DraftKings. BTIG upgrades to a hold-- to buy from hold. Jefferies, buy. They cite their fiscal discipline. They're finally beginning to cut some of those costs. They had a massive spend for years as they were trying to buy players.Piper Sandley-- Piper Sandler, excuse me, overweight based on their customer retention. And then one more, Morgan Stanley, overweight, citing their path to profitability. So those are four different analysts with four different reasons they like the stock. And that's why you feel it's beginning to get somewhere near the goal line, at least seeing profitability. There are a couple of other major players, of course-- FanDuel, owned by Flutter, eyeing a US listing.One other story I'm really eyeing in this sector is, of course, Fanatics. Still a private company. It's still not technically in sports gambling. But they did build their first ever sportsbook in Maryland, at the home of the Washington Commanders. So they're set to get on this field. Can they come anywhere near cracking those big three? Not likely. DraftKings in great position, entering this pivotal year.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they certainly are in great position. The average revenue per monthly unique player, that number that you were just talking about, that jumped 42% from a year ago to an average of 109. So, really talking about the fact that that is growing so exponentially on a year over year basis. And the Super Bowl numbers, we haven't heard anything specific from DraftKings, but what came out from its competitor, FanDuel, certainly sounds like sports betting was a hit there during the game last weekend.DAVE BRIGGS: And we're going to get some more states online this year. And then we're going to start next year with the Super Bowl in Vegas. So this feels like a pivotal year in that space.]"

Some in the oil market got that on Friday as fresh anxieties over inflation and rate hikes made them exit their long positions in crude after becoming wary about a supply glut taking shape from weeks and weeks of inventory builds reported by the U.S. government.But as they sold - possibly to re-enter when demand was better - others bought the dips as the market went down, defiant that the situation in crude will soon sort itself out, thanks to that one magic word: China.Since Beijing announced at the start of the year that it was doing away with all COVID controls, the long-oil world has been salivating over what that could mean for demand in the largest importer of the commodity.Even the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which looks after the interest of oil-consuming nations, has been waxing lyrical about how Chinese buying could exponentially remake this year’s oil market.The IEA forecast an additional 500,000 barrels per day of consumption from China this year that would take global oil demand to a record high. “Global oil demand is set to rise by 1.9 million bpd in 2023, to a record 101.7M bpd, with nearly half the gain from China following the lifting of its COVID restrictions,” the agency said in its January market report.Mind you, this came from an entity typically labeled by oil bulls as the “perma-bear” of demand - an unfortunate tag, no doubt, given the IEA’s bias towards consumers, who, unsurprisingly, want the lowest possible energy prices at any time.The problem though with what the long side of oil wants is there has to be enough hard data to support it.Analysts say Chinese import data supporting a major oil rally will likely not emerge for at least another two weeks. Meanwhile, latest available data showed the world’s largest crude importer bought 10.98 million bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd.Story continuesThe government in Beijing declared a “decisive victory” on Friday in its battle against COVID, claiming it had created “a miracle in the history of human civilization” in successfully steering China through the global pandemic. Analysts said that without hard numbers, such statements could only have fleeting impact.“It is going to be hard for oil to break out here until we see clear signs that China’s reopening is reaching the next level,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Simply put, no megaphone wielded by the IEA will sustain a rally toward $90 a barrel, until those Chinese import numbers come along. Also, Russia’s announcement of production cuts - in retaliation to Western sanctions on its oil - hasn’t been taken seriously enough by the market.On the contrary, what should matter to the market is what’s reported by the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. counterpart of the IEA. For eight straight weeks, the EIA has reported higher inventories of crude that have added nearly 51M barrels to supply.The latest weekly addition was an eye-watering 16.3M barrels which the EIA said was the fourth largest in its history of reporting on U.S. oil supply-demand.Not only crude inventories went up last week. Gasoline stockpiles have risen without stopping for seven weeks, adding around 19M million to supply. In fact, gasoline inventories have been on an uptrend since November, gaining in 12 of the past 14 weeks to bring forth more than 36 million barrels.Oil bulls have explained away the mammoth builds in crude to data irregularities at the EIA, as well as both scheduled maintenance and unplanned outages at U.S. refineries, which they say have led to a backlog in oil movement.U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15M bpd during the week ended Feb. 10 - some 383,000 bpd less than the previous week’s average, the EIA said. It added that refineries operated at 86.5% of their operable capacity last week. Typically, runs at this time of year are about 90% or more.Reuters, meanwhile, cited “unusually large crude oil supply adjustment” in EIA data that it said contributed to the builds of late - somewhat backing the contention of oil bulls.""It's the worst kind of build that you can possibly have. It's all about the...adjustment number. There's no getting around that,"" Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, said in comments carried by Reuters.The EIA has not commented yet on the so-called adjustments in data and some analysts said the builds it reported were real to an extent, not a figment of the agency’s imagination.Even if the supply climb was ""primarily due to a data adjustment, it continues to suggest markets face a near-term oversupply of crude as refiners have been slow to respond,"" said Robbie Fraser, manager, global research&amp;analytics at Schneider Electric, in a daily note.In the meantime, markets are caught in a new tug-of-war between U.S. inflation and growth.Traders of most risk assets - except possibly those in oil - have been spooked all week by one data point after indicating stubbornly higher inflation despite a year of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.U.S. wholesale prices, one of the key determinants of inflation, rose their most in seven months in January, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.That was after Tuesday's report on consumer prices that again suggested stickier-than-thought inflation.Since the updated data on inflation emerged, Federal Reserve officials have been girding for an extended period of high interest rates, including a return to a 50-basis point hike in March, saying creeping inflation makes the 25-basis point quantum that the central bank agreed on this month untenable.“We need to continue rate hikes until we see more progress,” Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday. “Inflation is still far too high. Your guess is as good as mine as to what happens next in the economy.” Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin concurred, saying controlling inflation would require more rate increases. “How many, we'll have to see,"" he added.The comments by Bowman and Barkin came on the heels of more rate warnings earlier in the week from other officials at the central bank.Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester said Thursday U.S. interest rates need to rise to above 5% and remain there an extended time in order to bring inflation down meaningfully.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, often viewed as the most hawkish official at the central bank, also said on Thursday he hadn’t been in favor of lowering the quantum of rate hikes - something that happened the last two months - until inflation was under better control.Bullard added that he would support a 50-basis point hike at the Fed’s next rate decision on March 22, after the 25-basis point increase on February 1.Former Treasury Secretary Summers, in rounding up the Fed rhetoric, said there’s a risk of the central bank “hitting the brakes very, very hard”.The Fed added 450 basis points to rates since March via eight hikes, in its bid to control runaway inflation. Rates currently stand at a peak of 4.75%. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, grew by an annualized rate of 6.4% in January. The Fed’s target for inflation, meanwhile, stands at 2% per year.Rate expectations for the Fed’s March 22 policy meeting, monitored by foreign exchange traders, remained at 25 basis points on Friday, though that could change with the increasing calls for tighter policing from the central bank’s hawks.Thus, Friday’s reversal of the upside seen earlier this week in crude prices was important, as it indicated that the oil trade was finally falling in line with other markets. Yet, the drop at settlement was just under 3%, compared with the intraday slump of around 5%. That meant that even as the market was falling, there were still longs rushing in to buy, probably in chase of the China dream.So, let’s revisit the birds-and-bush analogy explored at the start: The birds might be more easily found on the short side of oil now, even if China promises to be a gigantic bush to hold many of them.Oil: Market Settlements and Outlook London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $83.15. It settled the session down $2.14, or 2.5%, at $83. Brent’s intraday bottom was $81.81, a low since Feb. 6. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down 4%. Brent has slid in three of the past four weeks, losing more than 5% in that period.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $76.33 on Friday. It settled the regular session down $2.15, or 2.7%, to $76.27. WTI’s session low of $75.08 marked a near two-week bottom. For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was down 4.4%. WTI has fallen in three of the past four weeks, losing nearly 7% in that stretch.“For WTI, $79 had been an active resistance,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com. “Weakness below $77.50 could add to bearish pressure, pushing it further down towards $75.50.”Going into the week ahead, oil needs triggers to make a sustained break, he said.“A break below $75 may cause a further drop to the short-term support of 72.20, below which a further decline towards $70.10 is likely,” said Dixit.He added that consolidation above $77.50 could prompt a quick retest of $80.50, above which further recovery can be witnessed toward the $82.50 resistance.On the higher side, the 100-week Simple Moving Average of $83.75 continues to pose a challenge, while on the downside, bears have not given up hope for an assault on the 200-week SMA of $65.90.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Outlook The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.263 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday.It settled the official session at $2.2750, down 11.4 cents, or 4.8% on the day. For the week, it fell 9.5%.Except for last week’s rise of 4.3%, natural gas has fallen without stop since the week ended Dec. 9, losing 65% in the process.More importantly, Friday's low of $2.221 marked a new 2-½ year bottom for a front month contract on the Henry Hub. If the short-sellers in gas want to take out the $2 support, they would have to take the contract below the Sept. 28, 2020 bottom of $2.02.Dixit of SKCharting noted that gas has broken below the previous week's low of $2.35, meaning its “way is open” for further losses.“The near-term target will be $2.15 and $2.02, failing which the bears would target $1.90 and $1.75.”On the flip side, gas prices can start a bounce back from anywhere between $2.2-$2.0 and $1.90-$1.70, Dixit said.He said the rebound should be signaled by a weekly closing above the 5-week Exponential Moving Average of $2.68, followed by a better affirmation of a weekly close above $3.0- $3.30-$3.50.Gold: Market Settlements and Outlook Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,851.45 on Friday. It settled the regular session at $1,850.20 an ounce, down $1.60, or 0.01% on the day. For the week, the benchmark gold futures contract lost $12.60, or 0.7%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,843, up $6.51 or 0.4%.Dixit of SKCharting said the trend in spot gold appeared bearish in the short term. “It will stay so if prices sustain below the critical barrier of $1,878.”“Further from this point, even if gold extends its short-term upside towards $1,855-$1,860, it could again attract sellers aiming to dig deeper into the $1,800-$1,788 territory.”On the higher side, if gold manages to make a sustained break above the $1,845-$1,850 resistance zone, further limited upside might be witnessed towards $1,858-$1,868 - a level that needs to be cleared for a retest of the $1,878 critical barrier.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesNew Mexico feral cows to be culled by helicopter shootersIn Argentina's drought-hit fields, billion dollar losses and farmers going under]"

After all, the software giant had invested billions into OpenAI, which makes the artificial intelligence chatbot, and indicated it would sink even more money into the venture in the years ahead.What did come as a surprise was how weird the new Bing started acting. Perhaps most prominently, the A.I. chatbot left New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose feeling “deeply unsettled” and “even frightened” after a two-hour chat on Tuesday night in which it sounded unhinged and somewhat dark.For example, it tried to convince Roose that he was unhappy in his marriage and should leave his wife, adding, “I’m in love with you.""Microsoft and OpenAI say such feedback is one reason for the technology being shared with the public, and they’ve released more information about how the A.I. systems work. They’ve also reiterated that the technology is far from perfect. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called ChatGPT “incredibly limited” in December and warned it shouldn’t be relied upon for anything important.“This is exactly the sort of conversation we need to be having, and I’m glad it’s happening out in the open,” Microsoft CTO told Roose on Wednesday. “These are things that would be impossible to discover in the lab.” (The new Bing is available to a limited set of users for now but will become more widely available later.)OpenAI on Thursday shared a blog post entitled, “How should AI systems behave, and who should decide?” It noted that since the launch of ChatGPT in November, users “have shared outputs that they consider politically biased, offensive, or otherwise objectionable.”It didn’t offer examples, but one might be conservatives being alarmed by ChatGPT creating a poem admiring President Joe Biden, but not doing the same for his predecessor Donald Trump.OpenAI didn’t deny that biases exist in its system. “Many are rightly worried about biases in the design and impact of AI systems,” it wrote in the blog post.Story continuesIt outlined two main steps involved in building ChatGPT. In the first, it wrote, “We ‘pre-train’ models by having them predict what comes next in a big dataset that contains parts of the Internet. They might learn to complete the sentence ‘instead of turning left, she turned ___.’”The dataset contains billions of sentences, it continued, from which the models learn grammar, facts about the world, and, yes, “some of the biases present in those billions of sentences.”Step two involves human reviewers who “fine-tune” the models following guidelines set out by OpenAI. The company this week shared some of those guidelines (pdf), which were modified in December after the company gathered user feedback following the ChatGPT launch.“Our guidelines are explicit that reviewers should not favor any political group,” it wrote. “Biases that nevertheless may emerge from the process described above are bugs, not features.”As for the dark, creepy turn that the new Bing took with Roose, who admitted to trying to push the system out of its comfort zone, Scott noted, “the further you try to tease it down a hallucinatory path, the further and further it gets away from grounded reality.”Microsoft, he added, might experiment with limiting conversation lengths.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Whether it’s OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Bing, or Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) upcoming Bard, generative A.I. is seemingly all investors can talk about.But according to Douglas Rushkoff, author and professor of media theory and digital economics at the City University of New York, Queens College, the software is already peaking, and what we're seeing now is nothing compared to the A.I. we’ll see in the future.""Most of the companies we're looking at are just little apps built on top of the main existing A.I. platforms. OpenAI with Musk and Altman, Deepmind at Google, or Facebook’s (META) A.I., those are real. But looking forward, I feel like these companies will be understood as more of first-generation A.I.s,"" Rushkoff told Yahoo Finance Live.According to Rushkoff, today's A.I. uses a one-to-one model, in which it's fed data from the internet to improve its capabilities.In other words, when someone says a particular A.I. is two years ahead of a rival platform, it's because that first system has already been trained for two years, while the other is just starting to get off of the ground.Zoubin Ghahramani, vice president of research at Google, speaks at the Google AI@ event on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)In the future, though, A.I. will require far less data to learn, which will help them leapfrog modern systems.""Those are the ones that I'm most interested in,"" Rushkoff said. ""These sort of multi-dimensional, fractal-style learning models.""And while ChatGPT is still a relatively new platform, Rushkoff says that he believes the generative chatbot is plateauing.""I don't see ChatGPT itself getting that much better,"" Rushkoff said. ""I think it represents a stage in the evolution of A.I., but I feel like the model is peaking. I think ChatGPT is a great application on OpenAI, but it's sort of, okay, now what?""Still, generative A.I. is relatively new to most people. And with Bing still in an invite-only preview and Google’s Bard still in the testing phase, we'll likely see and hear plenty about similar services going forward.Story continuesOf course, ChatGPT and its ilk aren't perfect yet, either. Experts have criticized them for presenting inaccurate information or making up false statements out of whole cloth.I've been using Bing, and while it’s been helpful with some tasks, it's also presented me with incorrect data.Microsoft says it’s working to correct Bing's issues, which is also why it’s still in preview.

(NASDAQ:WBA) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/60-ownership-shares-walgreens-boots-140017085.html,1676728817.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 60% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walgreens Boots Alliance, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walgreens Boots Alliance?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walgreens Boots Alliance. The company's largest shareholder is Newcip S.A., with ownership of 17%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.1% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.0% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Walgreens Boots AllianceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. in their own names. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$163m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipWe can see that Private Companies own 17%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Walgreens Boots Alliance   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

(NYSE:AIG) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.32 per share on the 31st of March. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 2.1%, which is around the industry average. View our latest analysis for American International Group American International Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, prior to this announcement, American International Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 5.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 6.6% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendAmerican International Group Is Still Building Its Track RecordEven though the company has been paying a consistent dividend for a while, we would like to see a few more years before we feel comfortable relying on it. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.40 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. The dividend has been growing rapidly, however with such a short payment history we can't know for sure if payment can continue to grow over the long term, so caution may be warranted.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. American International Group has impressed us by growing EPS at 63% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.American International Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for American International Group that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

Last week, however, the crackdown expanded into Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain, which set off a new wave of customer concerns.Calgary, Alberta. Canada Dec 9 2019: A Person holds an Apple TV remote using the new Netflix app with a hand. Netflix dominates Golden Globe Nominations. IllustrativeOver the past few weeks, Netflix users have flooded our inbox with thoughts, concerns, and questions surrounding the crackdown.Many have threatened to cancel if extra fees are implemented, with some implying the move will likely help boost competitors like Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) and Disney+ (DIS).Yahoo Finance has reached out to Netflix for clarity surrounding the most-asked about questions and was directed to the platform's help center pages which details the rules for each specific country where the crackdown has been rolled out. (Remember: there has been no U.S. announcement so far)According to the help center, ""a Netflix account is meant to be shared in one household (people who live in the same location with the account owner).""""People who are not in your household will need to sign up for their own account to watch; or in some countries you can buy an extra member and add them to your account,"" Netflix said.The company added account holders can manage and update their primary location through the Netflix app. Users can also easily access their accounts while traveling or on vacation.Still, some users remain uneasy about the changes. Below are the top thoughts and concerns from our readers:Liz C.I’m a Canadian that pays for a premium Netflix account, so we can have up to 4 devices logged in at a time. We watch it on our cable box, and our two children watch it on their laptops at University. So now Netflix wants us to pay an additional $7.99 for additional users? My frustration is they are not making any money because costs of their movies and series is increasing, or costing too much. …Then stop spending so much on them? This sounds like a “you problem” not a me problem. I am paying enough for tuition, groceries and rent for my kids, now you want me to pay more? Stop being so greedy.Story continuesHunt D. One aspect of this story that I am not seeing mentioned in Canadian media is the impact of snowbirds. Over a million Canadians travel south for much of the winter, and the Netflix changes seem to eliminate our ability to use Netflix if we are away from our Canadian homes for over a month. ...We have not cancelled yet, but according to Netflix we will be locked out of our account on the 21st, so they may see a wave of cancellations at that time from Canadians who do not have access to their home wifi this time of year.Jeff K.I understand Netflix’s desire to stop five friends that don’t live together sharing one account login, but that is how they built their business. Families with children away at university would be considered part of the household under the Stats Can definition, since their primary residence is still with their parents. It is not a simple issue, but I feel Netflix has gone too far, unnecessarily.I have been a Netflix customer for years and seen numerous price increases. It started at about $8/month and is now $23/month. If I need to add another location, then I will most likely put Netflix on a rotation schedule throughout the year along with the other streaming services that I do that for; Disney+, Paramount+, Apple.Amanda G.If the policy change makes it that we would have to pay full price for a subscription, we would not add the service. The reality is each subscription service provides limited options at this point, and frankly I believe people will be returning to illegal downloads. Netflix was a draw because it meant we could get rid of our overpriced cable service. At this point, by needing multiple streaming services it will end up as being as expensive as cable.While I understand these are all businesses that want to make a profit, I believe it will end up being a short sighted approach.The economy is rapidly entering a recession. Streaming services are not a need and are an easy service to cut to save money. Netflix likely will only be the first to move towards preventing account sharing, but unlike Amazon prime, which offers an additional service for the cost, or Disney plus, which has the most popular children’s programming, they have little to make themselves imperative for the viewer.Annette C. This password crackdown is discriminatory to families whose children live in two households. Life is disruptive and chaotic as it is for two-household children and their ability to access their own content on streaming platforms across two-households helps establish some stability and reliability in their lives.Eric W.I stay at three other locations beside my home each month.This Netflix agreement is reducing my livelihood and subjecting me to hardship.Netflix has made new agreements with actors and film production companies and piggy backing on consumers to pay for their deals through these agreements!Peter K.One of our two sons attends university locally and lives at home (no Netflix problem there) The other one studies in another province. But although he's at home occasionally, most of his Netflix use is away from home (Netflix will likely force him to get his own account- as if students these days have more money to spend...)My wife and I are retired and travel a lot. Months at a time. But we live on a budget. ...We enjoy our Netflix account, but overall, the whole family is a rather occasional user.Phil K.My brother and I share a Netflix account. He lives elsewhere in the city.I pay for the entire HD package. I have decided if they implement this I will cancel. We currently have Prime, Crave &amp; Apple at times. So don’t need Netflix. Paying $23.30 a month is not worth not being able to share. We both live alone. Those are my thoughts.Donna M. As a snowbird on a fixed income, I have chosen Netflix as my streaming service. The new Netflix changes do not accommodate individuals/couples that spend part of the year out of their primary residence and they are asking snowbirds to pay the additional $7.99 monthly user fee to be able to stream when away from their primary residence, despite the primary residence not using Netflix during that time. ...I was told by Netflix customer service that I couldn’t share between my two residences unless I added the second one to my plan.I get them trying to reduce password sharing outside the home, but am really disappointed in them restricting the use of the primary account holder who travels.I will be canceling the service and really hope these changes prove to be disappointing to them.Julie W. One extremely important aspect of password sharing I have yet to see addressed, are those serving in the military, especially those who have spouses on deployment and can access Netflix.Patrick C. I feel like my issue with Netflix is a first world problem since we have 2 homes but I believe there are enough of us that Netflix will need to have a solution. I doubt we would cancel if they come up with a reasonable fix.Cara L. I'm wondering if this crackdown includes the account access that's included with some contract phone companies now because Verizon and T-Mobile include Netflix and Paramount+ with their plans. I share a phone plan my friends and don't live in the same household because if so then that's not fair since it was included in our phone plan when my friend signed us up through T-MobileMichael J. While I respect and appreciate where Netflix is coming from I also have a serious question.My parents and I do not share an account they have their own they pay for it and we pay for ours but they snowbird between a Northern State and a Southern state half the year. They own property in both places they use one Netflix account though. They don't bother to change their primary address they forward their mail for 6 months out of the year. Changing their primary residence location would be very difficult and require them to change their credit card information and the bank information just so that they could tie it to something like Netflix and set an address half the year to something else.They're really worried about this change in Netflix I don't know how to contact Netflix and tell them my concerns about this but I liked your article and I just wanted to tell our story. I was thinking about how I'm going to help my parents they're obviously not going to be able to go home and get on their Wi-Fi to get recertified and I'm not going to tell them they should change their address and billing information just to cope with the new rules so what should they do? They're legitimate paying customers who migrate and if migrating is going to be difficult they'll probably just cancel the account and I wouldn't blame them.I believe Netflix has a right to curtail their service to prevent theft of their service of a sort. But they've got to find a balance between doing what's right for them and what's fair for their customers. We don't all live the same life or in the same way. If people pay for the service they should be able to use it no matter where they are.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:TJX) insiders sold US$24m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tjx-companies-inc-nyse-tjx-110032215.html,1676804432,STORY,['TJX'],"[The fact that multiple The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies TJX Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$79.83, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 21% of Carol Meyrowitz's stake.All up, insiders sold more shares in TJX Companies than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).TJX Companies Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of TJX Companies shares. In total, insiders dumped US$2.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. TJX Companies insiders own about US$156m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The TJX Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold TJX Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, TJX Companies makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for TJX Companies you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.Of course TJX Companies may not be the best stock to buy.

30,2cca070a-223a-334a-a787-fd6f51e670ee,M,2023-02-19,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-044911821.html,1676782151,STORY,['M'],"[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, so the saying goes. Some in the oil market got that on Friday as fresh anxieties over inflation and rate hikes made them exit their long positions in crude after becoming wary about a supply glut taking shape from weeks and weeks of inventory builds reported by the U.S. government.But as they sold - possibly to re-enter when demand was better - others bought the dips as the market went down, defiant that the situation in crude will soon sort itself out, thanks to that one magic word: China.Since Beijing announced at the start of the year that it was doing away with all COVID controls, the long-oil world has been salivating over what that could mean for demand in the largest importer of the commodity.Even the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which looks after the interest of oil-consuming nations, has been waxing lyrical about how Chinese buying could exponentially remake this year’s oil market.The IEA forecast an additional 500,000 barrels per day of consumption from China this year that would take global oil demand to a record high. “Global oil demand is set to rise by 1.9 million bpd in 2023, to a record 101.7M bpd, with nearly half the gain from China following the lifting of its COVID restrictions,” the agency said in its January market report.Mind you, this came from an entity typically labeled by oil bulls as the “perma-bear” of demand - an unfortunate tag, no doubt, given the IEA’s bias towards consumers, who, unsurprisingly, want the lowest possible energy prices at any time.The problem though with what the long side of oil wants is there has to be enough hard data to support it.Analysts say Chinese import data supporting a major oil rally will likely not emerge for at least another two weeks. Meanwhile, latest available data showed the world’s largest crude importer bought 10.98 million bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd.Story continuesThe government in Beijing declared a “decisive victory” on Friday in its battle against COVID, claiming it had created “a miracle in the history of human civilization” in successfully steering China through the global pandemic. Analysts said that without hard numbers, such statements could only have fleeting impact.“It is going to be hard for oil to break out here until we see clear signs that China’s reopening is reaching the next level,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Simply put, no megaphone wielded by the IEA will sustain a rally toward $90 a barrel, until those Chinese import numbers come along. Also, Russia’s announcement of production cuts - in retaliation to Western sanctions on its oil - hasn’t been taken seriously enough by the market.On the contrary, what should matter to the market is what’s reported by the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. counterpart of the IEA. For eight straight weeks, the EIA has reported higher inventories of crude that have added nearly 51M barrels to supply.The latest weekly addition was an eye-watering 16.3M barrels which the EIA said was the fourth largest in its history of reporting on U.S. oil supply-demand.Not only crude inventories went up last week. Gasoline stockpiles have risen without stopping for seven weeks, adding around 19M million to supply. In fact, gasoline inventories have been on an uptrend since November, gaining in 12 of the past 14 weeks to bring forth more than 36 million barrels.Oil bulls have explained away the mammoth builds in crude to data irregularities at the EIA, as well as both scheduled maintenance and unplanned outages at U.S. refineries, which they say have led to a backlog in oil movement.U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15M bpd during the week ended Feb. 10 - some 383,000 bpd less than the previous week’s average, the EIA said. It added that refineries operated at 86.5% of their operable capacity last week. Typically, runs at this time of year are about 90% or more.Reuters, meanwhile, cited “unusually large crude oil supply adjustment” in EIA data that it said contributed to the builds of late - somewhat backing the contention of oil bulls.""It's the worst kind of build that you can possibly have. It's all about the...adjustment number. There's no getting around that,"" Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, said in comments carried by Reuters.The EIA has not commented yet on the so-called adjustments in data and some analysts said the builds it reported were real to an extent, not a figment of the agency’s imagination.Even if the supply climb was ""primarily due to a data adjustment, it continues to suggest markets face a near-term oversupply of crude as refiners have been slow to respond,"" said Robbie Fraser, manager, global research&amp;analytics at Schneider Electric, in a daily note.In the meantime, markets are caught in a new tug-of-war between U.S. inflation and growth.Traders of most risk assets - except possibly those in oil - have been spooked all week by one data point after indicating stubbornly higher inflation despite a year of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.U.S. wholesale prices, one of the key determinants of inflation, rose their most in seven months in January, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.That was after Tuesday's report on consumer prices that again suggested stickier-than-thought inflation.Since the updated data on inflation emerged, Federal Reserve officials have been girding for an extended period of high interest rates, including a return to a 50-basis point hike in March, saying creeping inflation makes the 25-basis point quantum that the central bank agreed on this month untenable.“We need to continue rate hikes until we see more progress,” Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday. “Inflation is still far too high. Your guess is as good as mine as to what happens next in the economy.” Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin concurred, saying controlling inflation would require more rate increases. “How many, we'll have to see,"" he added.The comments by Bowman and Barkin came on the heels of more rate warnings earlier in the week from other officials at the central bank.Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester said Thursday U.S. interest rates need to rise to above 5% and remain there an extended time in order to bring inflation down meaningfully.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, often viewed as the most hawkish official at the central bank, also said on Thursday he hadn’t been in favor of lowering the quantum of rate hikes - something that happened the last two months - until inflation was under better control.Bullard added that he would support a 50-basis point hike at the Fed’s next rate decision on March 22, after the 25-basis point increase on February 1.Former Treasury Secretary Summers, in rounding up the Fed rhetoric, said there’s a risk of the central bank “hitting the brakes very, very hard”.The Fed added 450 basis points to rates since March via eight hikes, in its bid to control runaway inflation. Rates currently stand at a peak of 4.75%. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, grew by an annualized rate of 6.4% in January. The Fed’s target for inflation, meanwhile, stands at 2% per year.Rate expectations for the Fed’s March 22 policy meeting, monitored by foreign exchange traders, remained at 25 basis points on Friday, though that could change with the increasing calls for tighter policing from the central bank’s hawks.Thus, Friday’s reversal of the upside seen earlier this week in crude prices was important, as it indicated that the oil trade was finally falling in line with other markets. Yet, the drop at settlement was just under 3%, compared with the intraday slump of around 5%. That meant that even as the market was falling, there were still longs rushing in to buy, probably in chase of the China dream.So, let’s revisit the birds-and-bush analogy explored at the start: The birds might be more easily found on the short side of oil now, even if China promises to be a gigantic bush to hold many of them.Oil: Market Settlements and Outlook London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $83.15. It settled the session down $2.14, or 2.5%, at $83. Brent’s intraday bottom was $81.81, a low since Feb. 6. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down 4%. Brent has slid in three of the past four weeks, losing more than 5% in that period.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $76.33 on Friday. It settled the regular session down $2.15, or 2.7%, to $76.27. WTI’s session low of $75.08 marked a near two-week bottom. For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was down 4.4%. WTI has fallen in three of the past four weeks, losing nearly 7% in that stretch.“For WTI, $79 had been an active resistance,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com. “Weakness below $77.50 could add to bearish pressure, pushing it further down towards $75.50.”Going into the week ahead, oil needs triggers to make a sustained break, he said.“A break below $75 may cause a further drop to the short-term support of 72.20, below which a further decline towards $70.10 is likely,” said Dixit.He added that consolidation above $77.50 could prompt a quick retest of $80.50, above which further recovery can be witnessed toward the $82.50 resistance.On the higher side, the 100-week Simple Moving Average of $83.75 continues to pose a challenge, while on the downside, bears have not given up hope for an assault on the 200-week SMA of $65.90.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Outlook The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.263 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday.It settled the official session at $2.2750, down 11.4 cents, or 4.8% on the day. For the week, it fell 9.5%.Except for last week’s rise of 4.3%, natural gas has fallen without stop since the week ended Dec. 9, losing 65% in the process.More importantly, Friday's low of $2.221 marked a new 2-½ year bottom for a front month contract on the Henry Hub. If the short-sellers in gas want to take out the $2 support, they would have to take the contract below the Sept. 28, 2020 bottom of $2.02.Dixit of SKCharting noted that gas has broken below the previous week's low of $2.35, meaning its “way is open” for further losses.“The near-term target will be $2.15 and $2.02, failing which the bears would target $1.90 and $1.75.”On the flip side, gas prices can start a bounce back from anywhere between $2.2-$2.0 and $1.90-$1.70, Dixit said.He said the rebound should be signaled by a weekly closing above the 5-week Exponential Moving Average of $2.68, followed by a better affirmation of a weekly close above $3.0- $3.30-$3.50.Gold: Market Settlements and Outlook Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,851.45 on Friday. It settled the regular session at $1,850.20 an ounce, down $1.60, or 0.01% on the day. For the week, the benchmark gold futures contract lost $12.60, or 0.7%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,843, up $6.51 or 0.4%.Dixit of SKCharting said the trend in spot gold appeared bearish in the short term. “It will stay so if prices sustain below the critical barrier of $1,878.”“Further from this point, even if gold extends its short-term upside towards $1,855-$1,860, it could again attract sellers aiming to dig deeper into the $1,800-$1,788 territory.”On the higher side, if gold manages to make a sustained break above the $1,845-$1,850 resistance zone, further limited upside might be witnessed towards $1,858-$1,868 - a level that needs to be cleared for a retest of the $1,878 critical barrier.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesNew Mexico feral cows to be culled by helicopter shootersIn Argentina's drought-hit fields, billion dollar losses and farmers going under]"

""Customers are engaging more with our products and are less relying on promotions.""DraftKings positive results didn't have much impact on the sector as a whole as MGM Resorts International (MGM), Penn Entertainment (PENN), Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) had muted stock reactions on Friday.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Dave Briggs discuss from DraftKings' fourth quarter earnings call.Key Video takeaways:0:15 DraftKings key numbers0:25 Hear from DraftKings CFO Jason Park1:00 Where DraftKings sits in the growth cycle1:20 Wall Street's reactions to DraftKings results2:00 How DraftKings compares to competitorsVideo TranscriptSEANA SMITH: A lot of earnings to sift through, so let's talk about some of the biggest movers, some of the biggest stories that we've covered this week. First up, DraftKings a huge mover today. Look at that-- a jump of just about 15%. The sports betting company soaring after beating revenue estimates for the fourth quarter, also narrowing its expected loss for 2023. Here's CFO Jason Park on what drove the company's success to end the year.JASON PARK: Our revenue was better than our prior guidance primarily because of structural improvement in our sportsbook hold and fundamentally better customer trends than we expected. Customers are engaging more with our products and are less reliant on promotions.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Certainly did help those results here, that DraftKings able to spend less on promotions. Sounds like they're building towards profitability, something that we know the Street certainly cares about, puts more of an emphasis on when we talk about these type of companies at this point in their maturity cycle. But those numbers and the growth numbers that they put up this past quarter were extremely impressive, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: It's incredible. It feels like the third quarter. We're not quite in the fourth, but the third for DraftKings. To your point, revenues up 80% year over year. Active members up 30% year over year. And I looked at a couple of notes here. And you talked about the different reasons to like DraftKings. BTIG upgrades to a hold-- to buy from hold. Jefferies, buy. They cite their fiscal discipline. They're finally beginning to cut some of those costs. They had a massive spend for years as they were trying to buy players.Piper Sandley-- Piper Sandler, excuse me, overweight based on their customer retention. And then one more, Morgan Stanley, overweight, citing their path to profitability. So those are four different analysts with four different reasons they like the stock. And that's why you feel it's beginning to get somewhere near the goal line, at least seeing profitability. There are a couple of other major players, of course-- FanDuel, owned by Flutter, eyeing a US listing.One other story I'm really eyeing in this sector is, of course, Fanatics. Still a private company. It's still not technically in sports gambling. But they did build their first ever sportsbook in Maryland, at the home of the Washington Commanders. So they're set to get on this field. Can they come anywhere near cracking those big three? Not likely. DraftKings in great position, entering this pivotal year.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they certainly are in great position. The average revenue per monthly unique player, that number that you were just talking about, that jumped 42% from a year ago to an average of 109. So, really talking about the fact that that is growing so exponentially on a year over year basis. And the Super Bowl numbers, we haven't heard anything specific from DraftKings, but what came out from its competitor, FanDuel, certainly sounds like sports betting was a hit there during the game last weekend.DAVE BRIGGS: And we're going to get some more states online this year. And then we're going to start next year with the Super Bowl in Vegas. So this feels like a pivotal year in that space.]"

39,2cca070a-223a-334a-a787-fd6f51e670ee,MA,2023-02-19,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-044911821.html,1676782151,STORY,"['GC=F', 'NG=F', 'CL=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, so the saying goes. Some in the oil market got that on Friday as fresh anxieties over inflation and rate hikes made them exit their long positions in crude after becoming wary about a supply glut taking shape from weeks and weeks of inventory builds reported by the U.S. government.But as they sold - possibly to re-enter when demand was better - others bought the dips as the market went down, defiant that the situation in crude will soon sort itself out, thanks to that one magic word: China.Since Beijing announced at the start of the year that it was doing away with all COVID controls, the long-oil world has been salivating over what that could mean for demand in the largest importer of the commodity.Even the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which looks after the interest of oil-consuming nations, has been waxing lyrical about how Chinese buying could exponentially remake this year’s oil market.The IEA forecast an additional 500,000 barrels per day of consumption from China this year that would take global oil demand to a record high. “Global oil demand is set to rise by 1.9 million bpd in 2023, to a record 101.7M bpd, with nearly half the gain from China following the lifting of its COVID restrictions,” the agency said in its January market report.Mind you, this came from an entity typically labeled by oil bulls as the “perma-bear” of demand - an unfortunate tag, no doubt, given the IEA’s bias towards consumers, who, unsurprisingly, want the lowest possible energy prices at any time.The problem though with what the long side of oil wants is there has to be enough hard data to support it.Analysts say Chinese import data supporting a major oil rally will likely not emerge for at least another two weeks. Meanwhile, latest available data showed the world’s largest crude importer bought 10.98 million bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd.Story continuesThe government in Beijing declared a “decisive victory” on Friday in its battle against COVID, claiming it had created “a miracle in the history of human civilization” in successfully steering China through the global pandemic. Analysts said that without hard numbers, such statements could only have fleeting impact.“It is going to be hard for oil to break out here until we see clear signs that China’s reopening is reaching the next level,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Simply put, no megaphone wielded by the IEA will sustain a rally toward $90 a barrel, until those Chinese import numbers come along. Also, Russia’s announcement of production cuts - in retaliation to Western sanctions on its oil - hasn’t been taken seriously enough by the market.On the contrary, what should matter to the market is what’s reported by the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. counterpart of the IEA. For eight straight weeks, the EIA has reported higher inventories of crude that have added nearly 51M barrels to supply.The latest weekly addition was an eye-watering 16.3M barrels which the EIA said was the fourth largest in its history of reporting on U.S. oil supply-demand.Not only crude inventories went up last week. Gasoline stockpiles have risen without stopping for seven weeks, adding around 19M million to supply. In fact, gasoline inventories have been on an uptrend since November, gaining in 12 of the past 14 weeks to bring forth more than 36 million barrels.Oil bulls have explained away the mammoth builds in crude to data irregularities at the EIA, as well as both scheduled maintenance and unplanned outages at U.S. refineries, which they say have led to a backlog in oil movement.U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15M bpd during the week ended Feb. 10 - some 383,000 bpd less than the previous week’s average, the EIA said. It added that refineries operated at 86.5% of their operable capacity last week. Typically, runs at this time of year are about 90% or more.Reuters, meanwhile, cited “unusually large crude oil supply adjustment” in EIA data that it said contributed to the builds of late - somewhat backing the contention of oil bulls.""It's the worst kind of build that you can possibly have. It's all about the...adjustment number. There's no getting around that,"" Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, said in comments carried by Reuters.The EIA has not commented yet on the so-called adjustments in data and some analysts said the builds it reported were real to an extent, not a figment of the agency’s imagination.Even if the supply climb was ""primarily due to a data adjustment, it continues to suggest markets face a near-term oversupply of crude as refiners have been slow to respond,"" said Robbie Fraser, manager, global research&amp;analytics at Schneider Electric, in a daily note.In the meantime, markets are caught in a new tug-of-war between U.S. inflation and growth.Traders of most risk assets - except possibly those in oil - have been spooked all week by one data point after indicating stubbornly higher inflation despite a year of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.U.S. wholesale prices, one of the key determinants of inflation, rose their most in seven months in January, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.That was after Tuesday's report on consumer prices that again suggested stickier-than-thought inflation.Since the updated data on inflation emerged, Federal Reserve officials have been girding for an extended period of high interest rates, including a return to a 50-basis point hike in March, saying creeping inflation makes the 25-basis point quantum that the central bank agreed on this month untenable.“We need to continue rate hikes until we see more progress,” Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday. “Inflation is still far too high. Your guess is as good as mine as to what happens next in the economy.” Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin concurred, saying controlling inflation would require more rate increases. “How many, we'll have to see,"" he added.The comments by Bowman and Barkin came on the heels of more rate warnings earlier in the week from other officials at the central bank.Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester said Thursday U.S. interest rates need to rise to above 5% and remain there an extended time in order to bring inflation down meaningfully.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, often viewed as the most hawkish official at the central bank, also said on Thursday he hadn’t been in favor of lowering the quantum of rate hikes - something that happened the last two months - until inflation was under better control.Bullard added that he would support a 50-basis point hike at the Fed’s next rate decision on March 22, after the 25-basis point increase on February 1.Former Treasury Secretary Summers, in rounding up the Fed rhetoric, said there’s a risk of the central bank “hitting the brakes very, very hard”.The Fed added 450 basis points to rates since March via eight hikes, in its bid to control runaway inflation. Rates currently stand at a peak of 4.75%. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, grew by an annualized rate of 6.4% in January. The Fed’s target for inflation, meanwhile, stands at 2% per year.Rate expectations for the Fed’s March 22 policy meeting, monitored by foreign exchange traders, remained at 25 basis points on Friday, though that could change with the increasing calls for tighter policing from the central bank’s hawks.Thus, Friday’s reversal of the upside seen earlier this week in crude prices was important, as it indicated that the oil trade was finally falling in line with other markets. Yet, the drop at settlement was just under 3%, compared with the intraday slump of around 5%. That meant that even as the market was falling, there were still longs rushing in to buy, probably in chase of the China dream.So, let’s revisit the birds-and-bush analogy explored at the start: The birds might be more easily found on the short side of oil now, even if China promises to be a gigantic bush to hold many of them.Oil: Market Settlements and Outlook London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $83.15. It settled the session down $2.14, or 2.5%, at $83. Brent’s intraday bottom was $81.81, a low since Feb. 6. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down 4%. Brent has slid in three of the past four weeks, losing more than 5% in that period.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $76.33 on Friday. It settled the regular session down $2.15, or 2.7%, to $76.27. WTI’s session low of $75.08 marked a near two-week bottom. For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was down 4.4%. WTI has fallen in three of the past four weeks, losing nearly 7% in that stretch.“For WTI, $79 had been an active resistance,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com. “Weakness below $77.50 could add to bearish pressure, pushing it further down towards $75.50.”Going into the week ahead, oil needs triggers to make a sustained break, he said.“A break below $75 may cause a further drop to the short-term support of 72.20, below which a further decline towards $70.10 is likely,” said Dixit.He added that consolidation above $77.50 could prompt a quick retest of $80.50, above which further recovery can be witnessed toward the $82.50 resistance.On the higher side, the 100-week Simple Moving Average of $83.75 continues to pose a challenge, while on the downside, bears have not given up hope for an assault on the 200-week SMA of $65.90.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Outlook The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.263 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday.It settled the official session at $2.2750, down 11.4 cents, or 4.8% on the day. For the week, it fell 9.5%.Except for last week’s rise of 4.3%, natural gas has fallen without stop since the week ended Dec. 9, losing 65% in the process.More importantly, Friday's low of $2.221 marked a new 2-½ year bottom for a front month contract on the Henry Hub. If the short-sellers in gas want to take out the $2 support, they would have to take the contract below the Sept. 28, 2020 bottom of $2.02.Dixit of SKCharting noted that gas has broken below the previous week's low of $2.35, meaning its “way is open” for further losses.“The near-term target will be $2.15 and $2.02, failing which the bears would target $1.90 and $1.75.”On the flip side, gas prices can start a bounce back from anywhere between $2.2-$2.0 and $1.90-$1.70, Dixit said.He said the rebound should be signaled by a weekly closing above the 5-week Exponential Moving Average of $2.68, followed by a better affirmation of a weekly close above $3.0- $3.30-$3.50.Gold: Market Settlements and Outlook Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,851.45 on Friday. It settled the regular session at $1,850.20 an ounce, down $1.60, or 0.01% on the day. For the week, the benchmark gold futures contract lost $12.60, or 0.7%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,843, up $6.51 or 0.4%.Dixit of SKCharting said the trend in spot gold appeared bearish in the short term. “It will stay so if prices sustain below the critical barrier of $1,878.”“Further from this point, even if gold extends its short-term upside towards $1,855-$1,860, it could again attract sellers aiming to dig deeper into the $1,800-$1,788 territory.”On the higher side, if gold manages to make a sustained break above the $1,845-$1,850 resistance zone, further limited upside might be witnessed towards $1,858-$1,868 - a level that needs to be cleared for a retest of the $1,878 critical barrier.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesNew Mexico feral cows to be culled by helicopter shootersIn Argentina's drought-hit fields, billion dollar losses and farmers going under]"

If we wait until we've won, to put a spade in the ground, we won't deliver the satellites on time.”Skynet will be an increasingly important part of the UK’s defences as space becomes a more contested environment. The next generation of warships and fighter jets will also rely on rapid, secure data communication delivered via satellites.Babcock last week won a competitive round of bids to operate the satellite network, worth £400m, beating BT, Serco and Airbus.Space is worth £16.5bn to the British economy and the industry employs 47,000 people, according to the UK Space Agency. Glasgow alone manufactures more satellites than anywhere else in Europe, according to Scottish Development International.The UK hosted its first space launch last month, with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit blasting off from Cornwall. The mission ended in failure but interest in launches from the UK has not waned.Story continuesMr Livingstone said: “There's enough export work in the space market to support more than one facility. It’s definitely an area where the UK could really get ahead by increasing its manufacturing capability.”Britain is an attractive market for investment because of its new National Satellite Test Facility at Harwell in Oxfordshire.Testing is crucial before sending a satellite into space, given the great expense associated with launches. Machines are tested to ensure they can survive the stresses of being hurled into the atmosphere and the wide temperature swings in space, tests colloquially referred to as “shake and bake”.The global satellite industry is dominated by the US where the industry is supported by Nasa’s deep pockets. However, Europe’s Airbus and Britain’s BAE Systems also operate space businesses here.Amongst other things, BAE has experience in the so-called hardening process of preparing computer chips for the harsh environment of space, working on processors included on the Mars Curiosity Rover.Satellites are used mainly for communication and positioning for navigation. However, space is seen as a growing field for investment given rising interest from both militaries and industry.Some manufacturers hope that floating factories may one day be launched into space. Orbit offers low gravity, very low temperatures and no oxygen, an environment in which the creation of many previously impossible alloys become a prospect.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Space is increasingly important for maintaining battlefield advantage, and it’s crucial we continue to push the frontiers of our space ambitions, enhancing our military resilience and strengthening our nation’s security.”]"

(NYSE:WEC) Maintain Its Strong Returns?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wec-energy-group-inc-nyse-125700302.html,1676811420,STORY,['WEC'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for WEC Energy Group is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.Does WEC Energy Group Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, WEC Energy Group has a superior ROE than the average (8.8%) in the Integrated Utilities industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for WEC Energy Group visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesWEC Energy Group's Debt And Its 12% ROEWEC Energy Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.49. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Indeed, this category of high-quality companies with steady cash flows and growing dividend distributions are sought out in times of turmoil. With interest rates on the rise, geopolitical concerns ramping up, and a recession potentially on the horizon, defensive growth stocks certainly seem like great investments right now.Of course, there are quite a few high-quality dividend stocks with solid growth trajectories to choose from. Accordingly, picking only three may seem like a daunting task.That said, there are three companies I’ve got my eye on. Here are three defensive growth stocks that I think are worth buying right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMCDMcDonald’s$266.16ABBVAbbVie$151.80NOCNorthrop Grumman$461.81McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comWe all love a classic, and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is no exception. With a long history of consistent returns, this stock has become one of the most popular among investors. Its global presence also makes it less susceptible to swings in the U.S. economy.In 2022, despite a weak stock market, McDonald’s shares did well due to strong demand for fast food. The company experienced increased traffic in many areas and was largely able to offset its rising costs by increasing its menu prices. MCD stock is comparatively expensive compared to its competitors. It trades at 34-times its earnings and has a dividend yield of just 2.3%. .However, the company’s massive size, solid growth, and dominant market position make it a more compelling investment option than other choices in the industry. Many analysts predict that the company will keep paying dividends, offering investors a stable source of income for decades to come.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a healthcare stock that’s rated BBB+ by S&amp;P, and it offers a high dividend yield of 3.9%. It has increased its dividend for 11 straight years, and its dividend has risen by an impressive, average rate of nearly 18% in the last five years.Story continuesAbbVie was successful in 2022, and investors anticipate that it will also perform well this year, despite the the fact that the patent on  its key Humira drug is expiring. Furthermore, ABBV has recently raised its quarterly dividend to $1.48 per share, up from $1.41. As a result, the company’s current yield is slightly less than 4%. As everyone monitoring AbbVie knows, the company’s earnings and revenue are likely to decline considerably this year, and that reality is already reflected in its stock price. However, if AbbVie can surpass these low expectations, its stock price will increase significantly.While I cannot predict whether AbbVie will beat the market in 2023, the stock will be lucrative for investors in the long run due to its strong dividend and its impressive pipeline.Northrop Grumman (NOC)Artist rendering of the B-21 bomber made by Northrup Grumman (NOC)Source: ALAN RADECKI, Public domain, via Wikimedia CommonsNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is certainly among the market’s top defensive growth stocks. This company has been a large, successful defense contractor for many decades. Due to its reliability and stability, Northrop Grumman is regarded as one of the market’s most dependable investments.Wall Street analysts, on average, expect Northrop Grumman’s stock price to increase to $495.55 in a year, versus its current share price of $460,. That’s not a great return, but it’s something. And it appears that the market believes in NOC stock more than analysts do . That can be a good thing. NOC’s EPS over the first nine months of last year was $31.61. Analysts, on average, expect the company’s 2023 EPS to come in around $26.84. In 2024, their mean estimate calls for EPS of $30.12. Thus, at around $470 per share, the stock is trading at roughly 15-times the average 2024 earnings estimate. That’s not cheap, but it’s not expensive either. Northrop Grumman has been increasing its dividends for 19 consecutive years,. Its low payout ratio of 13% suggests that it can raise its dividend a great deal in the future. For this reason and many others, I think this stock has a promising future.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in NOC. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/independent-director-juliana-chugg-just-120343491.html,1676808223,STORY,['VFC'],"[Investors who take an interest in V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) should definitely note that the Independent Director, Juliana Chugg, recently paid US$26.69 per share to buy US$400k worth of the stock. That's a very solid buy in our book, and increased their holding by a noteworthy 20%. View our latest analysis for V.F The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At V.FOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Mark Hoplamazian for US$491k worth of shares, at about US$28.04 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$26.99). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 86.50k shares worth US$3.0m. On the other hand they divested 677.00 shares, for US$34k. Overall, V.F insiders were net buyers during the last year. The average buy price was around US$34.93. These transactions suggest that insiders have considered the current price attractive. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does V.F Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. V.F insiders own about US$39m worth of shares. That equates to 0.4% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The V.F Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of V.F we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for V.F you should be aware of, and 2 of these don't sit too well with us.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) shareholders (or potential shareholders) will be happy to see that the President, Daniel Schulman, recently bought a whopping US$2.0m worth of stock, at a price of US$76.17. There's no denying a buy of that magnitude suggests conviction in a brighter future, although we do note that proportionally it only increased their holding by 7.1%. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PayPal HoldingsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Vice President of Global Sales, Peggy Alford, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$97.82 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$74.66. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Peggy Alford was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$2.7m for 34.54k shares. But they sold 21.79k shares for US$2.1m.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. PayPal Holdings insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$107m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About PayPal Holdings Insiders?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about PayPal Holdings.

55,9cb0fbc7-9202-3fd9-b9ae-368386783837,MPC,2023-02-19,Institutional investors may overlook Marathon Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE:MPC) recent US$1.9b market cap drop as long-term gains remain positive,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-overlook-marathon-121751707.html,1676809071,STORY,['MPC'],"[If you want to know who really controls Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 3.4% last week. Still, the 63% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Marathon Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marathon Petroleum?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Marathon Petroleum does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Marathon Petroleum, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Marathon Petroleum. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.7%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 7.2% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Marathon PetroleumWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Marathon Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$81m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 21% stake in Marathon Petroleum. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

(NASDAQ:ADI) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A US$0.86 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-121840602.html,1676809120,STORY,['ADI'],"[It looks like Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Analog Devices' shares before the 24th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.86 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.44 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Analog Devices has a trailing yield of 1.8% on the current share price of $192.71. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Analog Devices can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Analog Devices paid out a comfortable 47% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Analog Devices generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 37% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Analog Devices's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 24% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Analog Devices has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Analog Devices an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that Analog Devices is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Analog Devices, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in Analog Devices for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Analog Devices and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

(NYSE:V) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-visa-inc-nyse-130025959.html,1676811625,STORY,['V'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$231 and falling to the lows of US$205. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Visa's current trading price of US$224 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Visa’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Visa What Is Visa Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 10.07% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Visa today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $203.11, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, Visa has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will Visa generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Visa's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 48%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? V’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on V, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

63,2cca070a-223a-334a-a787-fd6f51e670ee,MAR,2023-02-19,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-044911821.html,1676782151,STORY,"['GC=F', 'NG=F', 'CL=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, so the saying goes. Some in the oil market got that on Friday as fresh anxieties over inflation and rate hikes made them exit their long positions in crude after becoming wary about a supply glut taking shape from weeks and weeks of inventory builds reported by the U.S. government.But as they sold - possibly to re-enter when demand was better - others bought the dips as the market went down, defiant that the situation in crude will soon sort itself out, thanks to that one magic word: China.Since Beijing announced at the start of the year that it was doing away with all COVID controls, the long-oil world has been salivating over what that could mean for demand in the largest importer of the commodity.Even the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which looks after the interest of oil-consuming nations, has been waxing lyrical about how Chinese buying could exponentially remake this year’s oil market.The IEA forecast an additional 500,000 barrels per day of consumption from China this year that would take global oil demand to a record high. “Global oil demand is set to rise by 1.9 million bpd in 2023, to a record 101.7M bpd, with nearly half the gain from China following the lifting of its COVID restrictions,” the agency said in its January market report.Mind you, this came from an entity typically labeled by oil bulls as the “perma-bear” of demand - an unfortunate tag, no doubt, given the IEA’s bias towards consumers, who, unsurprisingly, want the lowest possible energy prices at any time.The problem though with what the long side of oil wants is there has to be enough hard data to support it.Analysts say Chinese import data supporting a major oil rally will likely not emerge for at least another two weeks. Meanwhile, latest available data showed the world’s largest crude importer bought 10.98 million bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd.Story continuesThe government in Beijing declared a “decisive victory” on Friday in its battle against COVID, claiming it had created “a miracle in the history of human civilization” in successfully steering China through the global pandemic. Analysts said that without hard numbers, such statements could only have fleeting impact.“It is going to be hard for oil to break out here until we see clear signs that China’s reopening is reaching the next level,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Simply put, no megaphone wielded by the IEA will sustain a rally toward $90 a barrel, until those Chinese import numbers come along. Also, Russia’s announcement of production cuts - in retaliation to Western sanctions on its oil - hasn’t been taken seriously enough by the market.On the contrary, what should matter to the market is what’s reported by the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. counterpart of the IEA. For eight straight weeks, the EIA has reported higher inventories of crude that have added nearly 51M barrels to supply.The latest weekly addition was an eye-watering 16.3M barrels which the EIA said was the fourth largest in its history of reporting on U.S. oil supply-demand.Not only crude inventories went up last week. Gasoline stockpiles have risen without stopping for seven weeks, adding around 19M million to supply. In fact, gasoline inventories have been on an uptrend since November, gaining in 12 of the past 14 weeks to bring forth more than 36 million barrels.Oil bulls have explained away the mammoth builds in crude to data irregularities at the EIA, as well as both scheduled maintenance and unplanned outages at U.S. refineries, which they say have led to a backlog in oil movement.U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15M bpd during the week ended Feb. 10 - some 383,000 bpd less than the previous week’s average, the EIA said. It added that refineries operated at 86.5% of their operable capacity last week. Typically, runs at this time of year are about 90% or more.Reuters, meanwhile, cited “unusually large crude oil supply adjustment” in EIA data that it said contributed to the builds of late - somewhat backing the contention of oil bulls.""It's the worst kind of build that you can possibly have. It's all about the...adjustment number. There's no getting around that,"" Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, said in comments carried by Reuters.The EIA has not commented yet on the so-called adjustments in data and some analysts said the builds it reported were real to an extent, not a figment of the agency’s imagination.Even if the supply climb was ""primarily due to a data adjustment, it continues to suggest markets face a near-term oversupply of crude as refiners have been slow to respond,"" said Robbie Fraser, manager, global research&amp;analytics at Schneider Electric, in a daily note.In the meantime, markets are caught in a new tug-of-war between U.S. inflation and growth.Traders of most risk assets - except possibly those in oil - have been spooked all week by one data point after indicating stubbornly higher inflation despite a year of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.U.S. wholesale prices, one of the key determinants of inflation, rose their most in seven months in January, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.That was after Tuesday's report on consumer prices that again suggested stickier-than-thought inflation.Since the updated data on inflation emerged, Federal Reserve officials have been girding for an extended period of high interest rates, including a return to a 50-basis point hike in March, saying creeping inflation makes the 25-basis point quantum that the central bank agreed on this month untenable.“We need to continue rate hikes until we see more progress,” Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday. “Inflation is still far too high. Your guess is as good as mine as to what happens next in the economy.” Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin concurred, saying controlling inflation would require more rate increases. “How many, we'll have to see,"" he added.The comments by Bowman and Barkin came on the heels of more rate warnings earlier in the week from other officials at the central bank.Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester said Thursday U.S. interest rates need to rise to above 5% and remain there an extended time in order to bring inflation down meaningfully.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, often viewed as the most hawkish official at the central bank, also said on Thursday he hadn’t been in favor of lowering the quantum of rate hikes - something that happened the last two months - until inflation was under better control.Bullard added that he would support a 50-basis point hike at the Fed’s next rate decision on March 22, after the 25-basis point increase on February 1.Former Treasury Secretary Summers, in rounding up the Fed rhetoric, said there’s a risk of the central bank “hitting the brakes very, very hard”.The Fed added 450 basis points to rates since March via eight hikes, in its bid to control runaway inflation. Rates currently stand at a peak of 4.75%. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, grew by an annualized rate of 6.4% in January. The Fed’s target for inflation, meanwhile, stands at 2% per year.Rate expectations for the Fed’s March 22 policy meeting, monitored by foreign exchange traders, remained at 25 basis points on Friday, though that could change with the increasing calls for tighter policing from the central bank’s hawks.Thus, Friday’s reversal of the upside seen earlier this week in crude prices was important, as it indicated that the oil trade was finally falling in line with other markets. Yet, the drop at settlement was just under 3%, compared with the intraday slump of around 5%. That meant that even as the market was falling, there were still longs rushing in to buy, probably in chase of the China dream.So, let’s revisit the birds-and-bush analogy explored at the start: The birds might be more easily found on the short side of oil now, even if China promises to be a gigantic bush to hold many of them.Oil: Market Settlements and Outlook London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $83.15. It settled the session down $2.14, or 2.5%, at $83. Brent’s intraday bottom was $81.81, a low since Feb. 6. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down 4%. Brent has slid in three of the past four weeks, losing more than 5% in that period.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $76.33 on Friday. It settled the regular session down $2.15, or 2.7%, to $76.27. WTI’s session low of $75.08 marked a near two-week bottom. For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was down 4.4%. WTI has fallen in three of the past four weeks, losing nearly 7% in that stretch.“For WTI, $79 had been an active resistance,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com. “Weakness below $77.50 could add to bearish pressure, pushing it further down towards $75.50.”Going into the week ahead, oil needs triggers to make a sustained break, he said.“A break below $75 may cause a further drop to the short-term support of 72.20, below which a further decline towards $70.10 is likely,” said Dixit.He added that consolidation above $77.50 could prompt a quick retest of $80.50, above which further recovery can be witnessed toward the $82.50 resistance.On the higher side, the 100-week Simple Moving Average of $83.75 continues to pose a challenge, while on the downside, bears have not given up hope for an assault on the 200-week SMA of $65.90.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Outlook The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.263 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday.It settled the official session at $2.2750, down 11.4 cents, or 4.8% on the day. For the week, it fell 9.5%.Except for last week’s rise of 4.3%, natural gas has fallen without stop since the week ended Dec. 9, losing 65% in the process.More importantly, Friday's low of $2.221 marked a new 2-½ year bottom for a front month contract on the Henry Hub. If the short-sellers in gas want to take out the $2 support, they would have to take the contract below the Sept. 28, 2020 bottom of $2.02.Dixit of SKCharting noted that gas has broken below the previous week's low of $2.35, meaning its “way is open” for further losses.“The near-term target will be $2.15 and $2.02, failing which the bears would target $1.90 and $1.75.”On the flip side, gas prices can start a bounce back from anywhere between $2.2-$2.0 and $1.90-$1.70, Dixit said.He said the rebound should be signaled by a weekly closing above the 5-week Exponential Moving Average of $2.68, followed by a better affirmation of a weekly close above $3.0- $3.30-$3.50.Gold: Market Settlements and Outlook Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,851.45 on Friday. It settled the regular session at $1,850.20 an ounce, down $1.60, or 0.01% on the day. For the week, the benchmark gold futures contract lost $12.60, or 0.7%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,843, up $6.51 or 0.4%.Dixit of SKCharting said the trend in spot gold appeared bearish in the short term. “It will stay so if prices sustain below the critical barrier of $1,878.”“Further from this point, even if gold extends its short-term upside towards $1,855-$1,860, it could again attract sellers aiming to dig deeper into the $1,800-$1,788 territory.”On the higher side, if gold manages to make a sustained break above the $1,845-$1,850 resistance zone, further limited upside might be witnessed towards $1,858-$1,868 - a level that needs to be cleared for a retest of the $1,878 critical barrier.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesNew Mexico feral cows to be culled by helicopter shootersIn Argentina's drought-hit fields, billion dollar losses and farmers going under]"

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 3.3%. See our latest analysis for Exelon Exelon's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, Exelon's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 31.5%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 52%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.10, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.44. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 3.7% per year. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Exelon's EPS has fallen by approximately 12% per year during the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Exelon's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While Exelon is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We don't think Exelon is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Exelon (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) share price is up 31% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 20% (not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Juniper Networks To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Juniper Networks was able to grow its EPS at 13% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 9% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Juniper Networks has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Juniper Networks' TSR for the last 3 years was 43%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Juniper Networks shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 5.5% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 6.7%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

(NYSE:FIS) shareholders may wish to note that the Independent Director, Brian Shea, recently bought US$158k worth of stock, paying US$68.72 for each share. That's a very solid buy in our book, and increased their holding by a noteworthy 31%. View our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Fidelity National Information Services Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by Brian Shea was the biggest purchase of Fidelity National Information Services shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$69.50 per share to be enticing. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Fidelity National Information Services share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.Fidelity National Information Services insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any.

Indeed, this category of high-quality companies with steady cash flows and growing dividend distributions are sought out in times of turmoil. With interest rates on the rise, geopolitical concerns ramping up, and a recession potentially on the horizon, defensive growth stocks certainly seem like great investments right now.Of course, there are quite a few high-quality dividend stocks with solid growth trajectories to choose from. Accordingly, picking only three may seem like a daunting task.That said, there are three companies I’ve got my eye on. Here are three defensive growth stocks that I think are worth buying right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMCDMcDonald’s$266.16ABBVAbbVie$151.80NOCNorthrop Grumman$461.81McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comWe all love a classic, and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is no exception. With a long history of consistent returns, this stock has become one of the most popular among investors. Its global presence also makes it less susceptible to swings in the U.S. economy.In 2022, despite a weak stock market, McDonald’s shares did well due to strong demand for fast food. The company experienced increased traffic in many areas and was largely able to offset its rising costs by increasing its menu prices. MCD stock is comparatively expensive compared to its competitors. It trades at 34-times its earnings and has a dividend yield of just 2.3%. .However, the company’s massive size, solid growth, and dominant market position make it a more compelling investment option than other choices in the industry. Many analysts predict that the company will keep paying dividends, offering investors a stable source of income for decades to come.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a healthcare stock that’s rated BBB+ by S&amp;P, and it offers a high dividend yield of 3.9%. It has increased its dividend for 11 straight years, and its dividend has risen by an impressive, average rate of nearly 18% in the last five years.Story continuesAbbVie was successful in 2022, and investors anticipate that it will also perform well this year, despite the the fact that the patent on  its key Humira drug is expiring. Furthermore, ABBV has recently raised its quarterly dividend to $1.48 per share, up from $1.41. As a result, the company’s current yield is slightly less than 4%. As everyone monitoring AbbVie knows, the company’s earnings and revenue are likely to decline considerably this year, and that reality is already reflected in its stock price. However, if AbbVie can surpass these low expectations, its stock price will increase significantly.While I cannot predict whether AbbVie will beat the market in 2023, the stock will be lucrative for investors in the long run due to its strong dividend and its impressive pipeline.Northrop Grumman (NOC)Artist rendering of the B-21 bomber made by Northrup Grumman (NOC)Source: ALAN RADECKI, Public domain, via Wikimedia CommonsNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is certainly among the market’s top defensive growth stocks. This company has been a large, successful defense contractor for many decades. Due to its reliability and stability, Northrop Grumman is regarded as one of the market’s most dependable investments.Wall Street analysts, on average, expect Northrop Grumman’s stock price to increase to $495.55 in a year, versus its current share price of $460,. That’s not a great return, but it’s something. And it appears that the market believes in NOC stock more than analysts do . That can be a good thing. NOC’s EPS over the first nine months of last year was $31.61. Analysts, on average, expect the company’s 2023 EPS to come in around $26.84. In 2024, their mean estimate calls for EPS of $30.12. Thus, at around $470 per share, the stock is trading at roughly 15-times the average 2024 earnings estimate. That’s not cheap, but it’s not expensive either. Northrop Grumman has been increasing its dividends for 19 consecutive years,. Its low payout ratio of 13% suggests that it can raise its dividend a great deal in the future. For this reason and many others, I think this stock has a promising future.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in NOC. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

80,4eacbff3-0c13-3ecf-9cbf-d1bd1319a349,AXP,2023-02-19,Investors in American Express (NYSE:AXP) have made a decent return of 93% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-american-express-nyse-axp-130020105.html,1676811620,STORY,['AXP'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the American Express share price has climbed 79% in five years, easily topping the market return of 43% (ignoring dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for American Express To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, American Express managed to grow its earnings per share at 27% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, American Express' TSR for the last 5 years was 93%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that American Express shareholders are down 7.8% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.7%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for American Express   you should know about.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Tractor Supply's shares before the 24th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.03 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.12 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Tractor Supply has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of $239. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Tractor Supply paying out a modest 38% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 70% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Tractor Supply's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Tractor Supply's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 24% per annum for the past five years.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Tractor Supply has lifted its dividend by approximately 26% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineHas Tractor Supply got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. Tractor Supply looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.So while Tractor Supply looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.00bUS$10.6bUS$11.0bUS$11.3bUS$11.6bUS$11.9bUS$12.1bUS$12.4bUS$12.7bUS$13.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Est @ 2.91%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.48%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.27%Est @ 2.21%Est @ 2.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$9.4kUS$9.3kUS$9.0kUS$8.7kUS$8.3kUS$8.0kUS$7.7kUS$7.3kUS$7.0kUS$6.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$81bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$279bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$279b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$144bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$225b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$60.1, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-ColaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Coca-Cola Europacific Partners reported €17b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of €3.29 beat expectations, being 6.6% higher than what the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners earnings-and-revenue-growthTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' 16 analysts is for revenues of €18.1b in 2023, which would reflect a reasonable 4.5% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be €3.36, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of €18.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of €3.37 in 2023. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.The analysts reconfirmed their price target of €59.55, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at €69.00 and the most bearish at €46.50 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.Story continuesThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.5% annualised growth rate until the end of 2023 being well below the historical 7.9% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this to the 81 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.2% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.The Bottom LineThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to sales forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple Coca-Cola Europacific Partners analysts - going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.Before you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners that we have uncovered.Have feedback on this article?

92,49eb1fc0-0f84-3ad9-a68b-ef4c4ba9c094,SRE,2023-02-19,7 Stocks to Buy as U.S.-China Tensions Flare,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-u-china-120052171.html,1676548852,STORY,"['SRE', 'COST', 'XOM', 'PEP']","[After some signs of an attempt to soothe brewing bitterness, a suspected spy balloon flying over much of the continental U.S. dramatically pressured U.S.-China relations, in turn suggesting that investors need to adjust their stocks to buy accordingly. Essentially, market participants must focus on the essentials as economic consequences may erupt from the flareup in tensions.It’s an odd situation, to be sure. Just prior to the balloon incident, both U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to discuss various contentious matters.While the two nations stand at loggerheads over Taiwan, they also feature an intertwined economic relationship. As well, they cooperate on certain issues, such as narcotics enforcement, climate change and pandemic prevention.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut because of the rude timing of the alleged spy balloon journey, investors need to focus on relevant stocks to buy. Mainly, the competition between the two sides is on. Unfortunately, this narrative implies greater resource securing and consumption, sparking an inflationary impact.To protect yourself, it’s best to assume the worst. These are the stocks to buy as U.S.-China tensions flare.XOMExxon Mobil$115.39SRESempra Energy$157.60COSTCostco $509.10PEPPepsiCo$174.96BHPBHP$66.64HLHecla Mining$5.11GFSGlobalFoundries$70.25Exxon Mobil (XOM)A view of a well-lit Exxon Mobil gas station in Pasadena, CA during nighttime. representing exxon mobil stockSource: Michael Gordon / Shutterstock.comArguably one of the most relevant stocks to buy amid worsening U.S.-China relations is Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).To be sure, the big oil giant doesn’t align with contemporary ideological views regarding clean and sustainable energy. However, with relations between the top two economies of the world at a low point, you can imagine the Chinese won’t care so much about climate goals. So, consumption will rise, thus cynically lifting XOM.Another reason to target Exxon as one of the stocks to buy centers on China’s economic reopening. With increased commercial activity comes greater resource consumption. Greater resource consumption translates to more dollars chasing after fewer critical commodities.Story continuesTherefore, inflation can spike irrespective of whatever the Federal Reserve does (short of imposing a radical interest rate hike).Further, Exxon just makes sense from a purely financial perspective. Commanding a top-tier revenue growth rate and solid profit margins, it enjoys overall operational excellence. As well, it features strong stability in the balance sheet.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target pings at $124.88, implying over 7% growth.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile inflationary pressures will almost surely lift prices of electricity and other critical resources, investors should consider Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as one of the stocks to buy.Fundamentally, utilities benefit from their position as natural monopolies. Basically, companies like Sempra feature too massive of a footprint to dislodge. In other words, the barrier to entry is far too steep for would-be competitors.Admittedly, Sempra’s financials by themselves don’t look too great. For instance, its Altman Z-Score of 1.18 actually sits in the distressed zone. Further, its three-year revenue growth rate of 3.1% ranks below the sector median of 4.75%. Objectively, the market prices SRE at a forward multiple of 17.48, translating to an overvalued profile.Despite these challenges, Sempra operates a better-than-average profitable enterprise. Also, the company covers much of Southern California. With the Golden State representing the economic engine of the U.S., Sempra won’t be dislodged anytime soon.Moreover, Wall Street analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $172.50, implying upside potential.Costco (COST)Source: ShutterstockShould U.S.-China relations worsen from here, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) offers an intriguing opportunity to park one’s money.As stated above, the terse words and implied hyper-competitiveness associated with the balloon fallout may lead to consumption without care. If so, such a global dynamic would likely lead to accelerated inflation. Fortunately, Costco represents one of the most practical ways to mitigate rising prices.If consumers anticipate that inflation will become the norm, they may start buying essential non-perishables in bulk. Under this framework, Costco stands to benefit handsomely. After all, its entire business model centers on bulk shopping.Another factor favoring COST as one of the stocks to buy focuses on its core customers. On average, Costco customers are younger and wealthier than patrons of other big-box retailers. Therefore, Costco members should be more economically resilient than average.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg COST as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $558.17, implying meaningful upside potential%.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockBecause this list of stocks to buy focuses on the essentials, the inclusion of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) might seem odd.Let’s face it – it would be nice to knock down an ice-cold can of Pepsi on a hot summer day. However, water will do just fine. Nevertheless, I suspect many folks underestimate the significance of a company like PepsiCo.For one thing, America has a caffeine addiction. Some 90% of us consume caffeine in some form. Now, if you’ve been to your local Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) lately, you’ll notice that prices have become utterly ridiculous.Instead of paying six bucks or whatever it is for one drink, you should be able to pick up at least a six-pack. Over time, this adds up to significant savings.Second, everybody needs either downtime or some form of stress release. While I’m not about to make any personal recommendations, some folks may find comfort in soda or some other treat. In moderation, the associated endorphins may promote overall positivity based on a work-reward cycle.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PEP as a consensus moderate buy with an implied upside target of over 8%.BHP (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockWhen it comes to electric vehicles and the future of mobility, it’s not just the U.S. that’s aggressively competing in the sector.In many ways, the Chinese government has gone all-in on EVs. Granted, I don’t think it’s a controversial opinion to assume that American manufacturing would beat out Chinese standards. However, it’s not just about quality, which makes metals and mining firm BHP (NYSE:BHP) so compelling.Indeed, accelerated competition in the EV space translates to significantly more critical resource consumption. Under this framework, BHP almost invariably commands an extremely relevant business profile. Plus, with other countries stepping up their efforts in electrification, BHP easily ranks among the stocks to buy.Financially as well, BHP offers an attractive canvas for investors. Both its revenue growth rate and especially its net margin rank above their sector median values. Also, the market price BHP at a trailing multiple of 5.51. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 76% of its peers.Hecla Mining (HL)Macro of silverSource: Phawat / Shutterstock.comStaying on the metals and mining track, investors that want to take a speculative but evidence-based approach to stocks to buy on deteriorating U.S.-China relations should consider Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL).Specializing in precious metals, its focus on silver presents enormous relevancies. According to the Silver Institute, the underlying metal plays a vital role in the production of solar cells.Here’s the deal. Though China carries a reputation as a polluter, it also dominates the key manufacturing stages of solar panels.Of course, that’s a major problem for the U.S. and western countries because they’re increasingly integrating green solutions. Further, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also incentivizes European countries to fast-track renewable energy solutions. In other words, we’re dealing with three-dimensional chess, a game that should benefit HL.For full disclosure, investors will need to trust the narrative. Objectively, HL ranks as one of the more overvalued stocks to buy. Still, if it’s any comfort, Wall Street analysts peg Hecla as a consensus strong buy.GlobalFoundries (GFS)In this photo illustration GlobalFoundries (GFS) Inc. logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comAs the Covid-19 crisis unfolded, a key lesson learned painfully was that the U.S. should not make its critical supply chains vulnerable.In part to address this vulnerability, the Biden administration launched the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Moving forward, the legislation should promote the manufacturing of critical technologies at home, boding well for GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS).A few days ago, GlobalFoundries – a semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company – inked a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM). The deal ensures that GM receives earmarked supplies of necessary chips. It, too, learned the harsh lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dependency on others (especially other nations with often incongruent interests) can be difficult to say the least.Should relations with China continue to deteriorate, I expect the Biden administration to continue implementing a framework favorable to GFS. Heck, it’s one of the few bipartisan issues so the narrative makes it one of the top stocks to buy.To top it off, Wall Street analysts peg GlobalFoundries as a consensus strong buy. It’s really a no-brainer in terms of speculative investments.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The stock has sunk even though the company’s earnings beat analysts’ average estimates over the last four consecutive quarters.Investors might also want to buy DHR’s shares before it spins off its environmental and applied solutions unit later this year. The company announced last September that it plans to shed the unit so that it can focus exclusively on its life sciences and diagnostics businesses.Story continuesIQVIA (IQV)scientist wearing virtual reality headset interacts with futuristic holographic interface showing neurological dataSource: Gorodenkoff / ShutterstockNorth Carolina-based IQVIA (NYSE:IQV) is a health-information and clinical-research company. It runs clinical trials and laboratories for other healthcare companies and provides them with analytical-and-data services Today IQVIA employs 88,000 people in more than 100 countries and has a market capitalization of more than $40 billion. IQV stock has been a steady performer over the years, as it has gained 11% this year and is up more than 120% over the last five years.IQVIA pioneered the concept of virtual clinical trials or decentralized trials (DCTs) during the pandemic, a practice that is expected to continue. The market for such trials has been estimated to be worth $8.3 billion.Additionally, IQVIA has increased its annual revenue for 12 consecutive years and has improved its net income for three consecutive years. Analysts’ median price target on IQV stock is currently $260.00.Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Abbott (ABT) sign with lighting behind lettersSource: testing / Shutterstock.comThere are plenty of reasons to like Chicago-based Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Not only is the company a major producer of medical devices and generic drugs, but it has also increased its quarterly dividend for 51 consecutive years, making it a “Dividend King.” The company’s shares have declined alongside the stock market and have sunk 15% in the past 12 months. But ABT stock is up 77% over the last five years.A scandal involving contaminated baby formula resulted in a recall, and an ongoing criminal investigation has weighed on ABT stock over the last year. However, there is reason to expect the healthcare company to rebound in 2023.Specifically, the sales of Abbott Laboratories’ medical devices will climb as Covid-19 restrictions are loosened across China. Plus, the FDA has approved Abbott’s new glucose-monitoring system, called the “FreeStyle Libre 3 system,” for people with diabetes.  The revenue generated by the company’s diabetes devices increased 10% in 2022 and could climb again this year.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comNow we come to the world’s largest healthcare insurance company, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). The Minnesota-based company employs nearly 400,000 people who collectively serve nearly 150 million people in every U.S. state and 33 countries around the world. UnitedHealth reported 2022 revenue of $324.2 billion, up 13% from 2021. Its earnings per share (EPS) last year climbed 18% year-over-year to $21.18.UnitedHealth has also hiked its dividend every year since it switched to a quarterly payout in 2010, including a 13.7% increase in 2022 to $1.65 per share.In March 2022, UNH announced that it would purchase LHC Group for $5.4 billion,  expanding its home-healthcare business. UNH stock is down 6% so far in 2023, but has gained 113% over the last five years. Given the company’s long-term track record, it would be a safe bet to buy this healthcare name on weakness.Humana (HUM)A Humana (HUM) office buildingSource: Shutterstock.comAnother major health insurer is Kentucky-based Humana (NYSE:HUM). The third-largest health insurance provider in the U.S., Humana’s stock has held up well despite the market’s volatility in the past year. Over the last 12 months, HUM stock has increased 20%. Through five years, the stock has gained 85%. It also has a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 22 and pays a quarterly dividend of 78 cents a share, which is good for a yield of 0.6%.Fueled by an aging population and their medical needs, the worldwide health insurance industry’s revenue will increase 7.1% annually to $2.6 trillion by 2028, market researcher Imarc Group forecast. With nearly 25 million plan members and counting, Humana should benefit from the continued growth of its medical, dental, vision, and other health-insurance plans.The company just reported strong fourth-quarter numbers , as its revenue grew 6.6% year-over-year to $22.4 billion, while its EPS jumped 30.6% YOY to $1.62.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIt’s difficult to ignore pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) because of the potential of its obesity drug, Tirzepatide, which could prove to be a blockbuster medication. Some analysts are going so far as to claim that Tirzepatide could be the biggest-selling drug of all time. While that might be hyperbole at this point, LLY stock is up nearly 40% over the last 12 months, largely on speculation related to its weight-loss medication that the FDA is considering approving.LLY stock has pulled back about 7% to start the year, and investors might want to buy the dip ahead of  Tirzepatide gaining FDA approval. Also known as Mounjaro, Tirzepatide was approved as a diabetes treatment last May, and the company anticipates that it will be  approved to treat obesity at some point this year.Considering that more than 40% of the world’s population is overweight or clinically obese, the medication could have an instant market of more than 2 billion people worldwide.And  Eli Lilly has blockbuster prescription drugs that are generating sales for it now. Specifically, the company sells Prozac that treats depression, Trulicity that is used to manage diabetes, and Cialis for erectile dysfunction. Together, these drugs have enabled its annual sales to reach $30 billion.Healthcare Stocks to Buy: Moderna (MRNA)The Moderna (MRNA) logo surrounded by syringes, pills and disposable face masks.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comBoston-based Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is another pharma stock worth considering. The company, which pioneered the development of vaccines using messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce an immune response in people, has had great success with its Covid-19 shot, racking up sales of $18.4 billion in 2022. The company recently forecast minimum Covid-19 vaccine sales of $5 billion for this year, fueled primarily by booster shots given to people around the world.Questions and concerns linger about Moderna’s drug pipeline and what comes next for the company that was founded in 2010. However, there is reason to be optimistic on this front, as Moderna currently has 44 treatment and vaccine candidates in development, including 21 that are in clinical trials.Its prescription drug candidates include medications to treat HIV, respiratory diseases, and cancer. Analysts seem most excited about Moderna’s vaccine candidate that is designed to treat both Covid-19 and influenza (seasonal flu) in a single dose.MRNA stock has  climbed 18% in the past 12 months.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in DHR.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Estée Lauder Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$21b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 17%.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.1%. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams Sherwin-Williams' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, prior to this announcement, Sherwin-Williams' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 38.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendSherwin-Williams Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.52 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.40. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 17% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 4.3% per year. Earnings growth is slow, but on the plus side, the dividend payout ratio is low and dividends could grow faster than earnings, if the company decides to increase its payout ratio.We Really Like Sherwin-Williams' DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Sherwin-Williams is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.
