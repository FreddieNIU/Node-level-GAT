The order has led to favorable conditions for the formation of large holding companies. Although holding companies have always been a reality of the business, their definition, motivations for existing, and size have changed dramatically in the past few decades. A holding company usually exists to control other firms.\xa0', 'It is important to take a deeper dive into the exact definition of holding firms to clear ambiguities regarding their existence. Holding companies are formed to control other firms, and do not generally manufacture products, offer day-to-day business services, or carry out any business operations. Although holding firms can hire and fire managers of subsidiaries - the firms the holding company controls - the subsidiaries remain separate entities in terms of their operations. This shields the parent firm from the liabilities of the subsidiary.\xa0', 'Holding companies may also be formed in some cases for tax benefits. For example, if the parent company of a subsidiary is located in a lower tax region, it would help avoid higher taxes on the parent even if the subsidiary were located in another region. Other benefits offered by holding firms include central management for better control, branding appeal, and flexibility in terms of financial investments. Some of the top holding companies in the world today include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).\xa0', 'The incredible rise of holding firms can be better understood in the context of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), a multinational conglomerate led by veteran investor Warren Buffett that has a market capitalization of close to $800 billion. Over the past five years, the shares of the firm have returned more than 89% to investors, closely mirroring the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 that has returned 90% to investors during the same time period. During a recent earnings call, the company urged investors to look past fluctuations in the portfolio.', '“The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.”', 'A close up shot of a stock ticker reflecting the performance of Indian equity markets.', 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that operate as holding corporations were selected for the list and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment.

And there are many things that have the potential to get in your way."", 'A recent Schwab survey found that Gen Zers are facing a number of obstacles that are impacting their ability to save for the future. A good 54% point to inflation as a major obstacle, while 31% cite emergency expenses.', ""But for 30% of Gen Zers, helping aging parents financially is a reason they're struggling to save money. And that's not a boat you want to end up in. With a couple of key steps, however, you can potentially avoid that situation."", ""Many adults end up in a position where they have to assume a caregiving role. That's something you may want to be able to do for your parents -- namely because they sacrificed so much to raise and care for you."", 'However, you should know that the cost of being a caregiver can be huge. For one thing, you might spend a lot of money just running back and forth to see your parents and helping them with tasks like shopping and household chores.', 'Also, if your parents are reliant on you for help, you may not be able to commit to a higher-level job. The result? Lower earnings for you, and less opportunity to save.', ""That's why it's so important to set expectations and have an open discussion about things like caregiving and logistical and financial support before your parents end up in a position where they need it. And if you have siblings, involve them, as it should really be a group effort to make sure your parents' needs are met."", ""A big reason some adults end up in a caregiving role is that the cost of long-term care can be absolutely prohibitive. Genworth reports that as of 2021, the average cost of a home health aide was almost $62,000 a year on a national level. If your parents can't afford to shell out that kind of money, they might end up relying on you to help on a regular basis as they age."", ""That's why it's a good idea to talk to your parents about long-term care insurance. If they have a financial advisor they work with, that person could serve as a resource and help them explore their options."", ""Long-term care insurance is definitely a notable expense, and each policy out there comes with its own costs and coverage. So it's the sort of thing that will require a lot of research, and that research may be over your head. Hence, it's a good idea to turn to a financial advisor for help."", ""However, a long-term care policy could help defray a lot of the costs your parents might face as they get older -- such as visits from home health aides and assisted living fees. And if your parents are able to get that outside help, it'll put less of a financial and logistical burden on your personal finances."", 'You may be of the mindset that you should do everything you can to support your parents as they age. But mapping out a plan and looking into long-term care insurance are ways to help out, so aim to do those things sooner rather than later.', ""If you're using the\xa0wrong credit or debit card, it could be costing you serious money.\xa0Our experts love this top pick,\xa0which features\xa0a\xa00% intro APR\xa0for 15 months, an insane cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee."", 'In fact, this card is so good that our experts even use it personally.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.2%."", ' View our latest analysis for Nucor ', ""It would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Nucor's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 54.8%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 23%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.', ""The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.47 total annually to $2.04. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 3.3% over that duration. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Nucor has grown earnings per share at 25% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend."", ""Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity."", ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize.

DOCU, Nike, Inc. NKE, Target TGT and Walmart WMT.', 'Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores the bullish market rally following the Fed’s rate cut outlook. Despite the impressive run for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in 2023, many large-cap stocks have underperformed for various reasons. The three highly-ranked stocks we dig into today are all trading at least 30% below their highs and could be poised for serious comebacks in 2024.', 'Jay Powell and the Fed gave the green light to the bulls on Wednesday when the world’s most important central bank signaled the possibility of three rate cuts in 2024. The 10-year U.S. Treasury is back below 4% (3.92%) after sitting at 5% in late October as Wall Street rapidly prices in lower rates.', 'The Fed’s newfound dovishness finally confirms what the bulls have been saying and doing for a large chunk of 2023 and certainly since the end of October. The S&P 500 appears on the cusp of summiting a new peak by the end of 2023 or early 2024.', 'All of this strength came before we even entered the official Santa Claus rally period, which includes the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year.', 'There will likely be some selling and choppiness in the weeks and months ahead. Still, more money is poised to flow into stocks in 2024 as the calculus on cash and bonds changes and investors grow increasingly nervous about missing out again.', 'DocuSign, Inc.', 'DocuSign crushed our Q3 FY24 EPS estimate on December 7 and raised its guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. DOCU stock has soared 30% in the last month to retake its 50-day, its 200-day, and its long-term 50-week moving averages. Yet, the e-signature stock still trades over 80% below its record highs after it got crushed for slowing growth and weak bottom-line results.', 'DOCU’s revenue soared following its 2018 IPO, including four straight years of between 35% to 49% growth (19% last year in FY23). The company remains a powerhouse of electronic signatures, document generation, and beyond as medical forms, legal documents, and much more are becoming increasingly paperless. DocuSign has responded to its slower growth and higher rate environment by cutting costs, changing leadership, and rolling out other efforts to streamline its business.', 'DocuSign’s valuation levels remain sky-high. But DOCU is focused on the bottom line. Investors might want to consider the e-signature and digital document firm with 1.4 million customers as Wall Street begins to search high and low for technology stocks that are still trading far below their highs.', 'Nike, Inc.', 'Nike trades around 30% below its highs heading into its Q2 FY24 earnings release on December 21. Wall Street sold Nike shares based on fears about growing competition and other headwinds. NKE also got caught up in the broader consumer discretionary selloff. Nike certainly faces increased competition from relative newcomers Hoka and On in the running shoe segment and among consumers looking for maximum comfort and support at their jobs. Adidas, Lululemon, and digital native upstarts are also fighting for a larger share of the so-called streetwear market or the fashion end of sportswear.', 'Despite more challengers, Nike remains the heavyweight champion of sportswear and one of the most valuable brands in the world alongside the likes of Coca-Cola. NKE has treaded down a new direct-to-consumer-heavy path in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. Nike’s sales are projected to climb 4% this year and over 8% higher next year to help boost its adjusted earnings by 16% and 17%, respectively, based on Zacks estimates.', 'Nike’s earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now and its Shoes and Retail Apparel segment is in the top 23% of over 250 Zacks industries. Nike has climbed 850% during the last 15 years vs. the S&P 500’s 420% and its sector’s 220%. Nike is up 73% in the past five years, even though it trades 30% below its highs. Nike has retaken its 50-day and 200-day and is on the cusp of climbing above its very long-term 50-month moving average. Nike trades near its 10-year median at 29.7X forward 12-month earnings and pays a dividend.', 'Target', 'Target posted blowout Q3 earnings results in mid-November and provided upbeat guidance that helped it capture a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The strong bottom-line performance extended its recent rebound that has TGT stock up 30% since the start of the fourth quarter. Even with the comeback, the retail standout trades 45% below its highs.', 'TGT’s resurgence has taken it right to its 50-week moving average and solidly above its 200-day and 50-day. Target trades at a 30% discount to its sector, 32% below Walmart, and close to TGT’s 10-year median. TGT stock is far more than a plummeting pandemic winner. Target crushed Walmart over the last 15 years, up 310% vs. 170% despite its massive fall from its 2021 highs.', 'Target, like many others, failed to adapt to quickly changing consumer shopping patterns over the last year-plus. The firm is also dealing with other setbacks. But it appears that TGT is finally finding its footing again. TGT’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar 39% this year and then climb another 9% higher next year.

However, the sector can still do very well even at current prices. In fact, many companies are banking on oil staying where it is or suffering only a minor decline. Here's why the energy sector is set up nicely for 2024 and why it could be worth investing in now."", 'The last few months have featured a flurry of mergers and acquisitions on the upstream side of the energy sector. In October, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) announced an all-stock merger with Permian Basin producer Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5 billion. Later that month, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announced a merger with Hess for $53 billion, gaining access to the oil reserves offshore Guyana among other global plays. And earlier this month, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) announced a $12 billion acquisition of privately held Permian producer CrownRock.', ""In the case of Exxon and Oxy, the idea is to get more acreage in a familiar region. This approach can save costs through synergies and boost free cash flow (FCF) if done right. Chevron's deal is a diversification move. It gives it access to a low-cost offshore oil play, which pairs nicely with its existing Permian and liquefied natural gas position."", ""The deals vary in scope and scale. But the rationale behind them is the same: produce more oil and gas at a lower cost per barrel. It's good old-fashioned leverage that can amplify gains during certain conditions and compound losses if oil prices take a turn for the worse."", ""On Dec. 6, ExxonMobil published a corporate plan centered around doubling its earnings by 2027 based on Brent crude oil (the international benchmark) averaging $60 a barrel. However, it also said that 90% of its planned upstream capital investments over the next five years will be able to return 10% or more even if Brent crude oil is $35 a barrel. That's a massive margin for error on the downside and plenty of upside potential even for mediocre oil prices."", 'Assuming its merger with Hess goes through, Chevron expects to be able to double its free cash flow by 2027. On the downside, Chevron said it is ""built for $50 Brent,"" as it can cover its capital expenditures and dividend payments at that level in addition to its operating costs.', 'Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum expects to be able to generate an additional $1 billion in free cash flow in the first year following its acquisition, assuming $70 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (the U.S. benchmark). Oxy also said that the acquisition increased the portion of its unconventional portfolio that can break even below $40 oil by 33%.', 'Exxon, Chevron, and Oxy are just a few of the many upstream producers. But in general, a lot of upstream corporate plans are based around breaking even somewhere around $40 a barrel, and assuming a price of $60 to $70 to fund long-term growth. For example, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) has a 10-year plan to grow FCF at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 11% per year based on $60 WTI oil prices. But ConocoPhillips can also achieve FCF breakeven at $35 per barrel of WTI crude.', ""As much as oil and gas producers will try to build a growth plan around a certain price range, there's simply no telling what energy prices will do in the short term. Even if oil prices take a huge dip, many producers have the balance sheets needed to weather the storm. Sure, companies like Oxy are taking on a lot of debt and banking on at least decent oil prices."", 'But in the case of Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, these companies can still fund growth plans even if oil prices fall, and pause buybacks and pull back on spending if prices collapse. Moreover, these three companies sport excellent balance sheets, with total net long-term debt positions and debt-to-capital leverage ratios near 10-year lows.', 'In short, the balance sheets and the cost profiles of many top producers should allow these companies to thrive even if oil prices stay the same or fall to an extent. While the industry as a whole should rake in the cash if oil prices rebound to levels they were at just a few months ago (in the $80 to $90 WTI range).', ""Although the integrated majors and upstream producers make up the majority of the energy sector, there's still the transportation and storage (midstream) and refining and marketing (downstream) segments to consider."", ""Many midstream companies feature slow growth but pay high dividends thanks to the reliability that comes from long-term contracts. These contracts, many of which are take-or-pay (paid no matter what) or fee-based (locked-in prices) limit exposure to oil and gas prices. Many companies want to avoid over-expanding or building infrastructure that won't be needed as the energy transition accelerates in the years to come. Overall, the midstream industry is a good value with manageable debt and attractive dividends."", 'Downstream leaders like Valero, Marathon Petroleum, and Phillips 66 also have inexpensive valuations. Despite excellent results, many downstream stocks have sold off over the last few months. Renewable energy is having a major impact on power generation. And electric vehicles have certainly pierced the passenger vehicle market. But refining crude oil into useful sources is an essential process that underpins modern society and the transportation industry.', 'The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE), which tracks the performance of the broader energy sector, has a yield of 3.6% and a price to earnings ratio of just 7.5. Granted, these earnings are based on the last 12 months, which featured higher oil prices. But still, the sector is cheap and does a good job of unlocking income and value from the integrated majors, conservative producers, the midstream industry, and the downstream industry, which also balances out the high risk and volatility that comes with more aggressive and smaller producers.', 'The sector stands out as a haven for value and passive income, as well as strong earnings results, even if oil and gas prices stay the same or modestly decline.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?', 'Before you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ExxonMobil wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""Among some investors, there's a perception or concern that allocating funds toward dividend payouts might limit a company's ability to reinvest in its operations or growth initiatives. However, there might not be a trade-off between higher dividends and increased profit growth, as reported by Newton Investment Management. In fact, giving dividends could encourage companies to manage their funds more wisely. In their paper titled Surprise! Higher Dividends = Higher Earnings Growth, Robert D. Arnott and Clifford S. Asness found a positive relationship between how much a company pays in dividends and its future earnings growth in the US market over seven decades until 2001. This suggests that paying dividends promotes better control over capital, potentially leading to stronger long-term returns. Additionally, companies that generate high returns on invested capital (ROIC) and carefully reinvest their capital are more likely to sustain a healthy and growing dividend. The report highlighted research by Conover et al. (2016), which conducted an extensive empirical study spanning more than five decades, from 1962 to 2014, using US market data. Their research revealed that investing in stocks that pay dividends not only boosts returns but also notably diminishes the risk associated with both value and growth portfolios. This outcome held true across various market capitalizations, indicating that the benefits of investing in dividend-paying stocks extend beyond specific sectors or company sizes."", ""When examining the broader scope of dividend stocks without isolating their performance to specific periods, it becomes evident that dividends consistently play a significant role in contributing to the overall market returns. Dividends have played a significant role in stock market returns, contributing to 40% of the total returns since 1930 and rising to 54% during periods of high inflation. Particularly during these inflationary times, stocks that consistently raised their dividends outpaced the overall market performance. Moreover, dividend payments can serve as a stabilizing force, potentially reducing the overall volatility in a stock's total return. This stability often appeals to investors looking for steadier income streams and less fluctuation in their investment portfolios."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Analysts.', 'Gold has started to make noise in the stock and commodity markets again as it recently jumped to a record high. One of the main reasons behind this surge is the belief that the yellow metal is a hedge against inflation, and investors want to safeguard their money in an uncertain economic environment. Furthermore, central banks are also aggressively buying gold. The central banks added 30% of the world’s mining production to their reserves in 2023. The SVB crash and Middle-East conflict have been a growth catalyst for the precious metal in the year. Gold stocks have also reaped the rewards of rising gold prices and central bank activity. At its latest earnings call presentation, Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU)’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Tomory, said:', '“Centerra had a very strong third quarter with significant free cash flow generation, driving a substantial increase to our cash balance outperformed our expectations, producing almost 87,000 ounces in the quarter. Our 2023 consolidated gold production guidance remains on track between 340,000 and 360,000 ounces, and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter further increasing our cash balance by the end of the year.”', 'Gold has shown resilience during a high-interest rate environment, expectations that the Fed might start cutting interest rates in 2024 could be favorable for the commodity in the coming year. Lower interest rates could make cash and cash equivalents less enticing compared to gold.', 'The third quarter also saw the largest takeover in gold mining in 2023. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited on November 6. The company acquired Newcrest for A$26.2 billion, adding five active mines and two advanced projects to the world’s largest gold mining company’s portfolio.', 'Some experts believe that while gold is a hedge against inflation, the statement is partially true. Gold is volatile commodity. Historically, gold has been seen to be more volatile than stocks and bonds. In a recent video, billionaire Ken Fisher explains that since the gold standard ended, gold has had lower long-term returns compared to stocks and bonds, yet it has been significantly more volatile than both. Stocks have been shown to return almost twice as much as gold with 20% lesser volatility.', 'Fisher further explains that gold has a very long period of losing money and then gives a short window where the prices rise remarkably. In conclusion, the billionaire believes that investors have to time their investments in gold perfectly to achieve maximum results and timing gold is trickier than timing stocks and bonds.', 'When it comes to gold stocks, Fisher believes that, more often than not gold, they fall into a subcategory that moves with the smaller value stocks.', 'Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) has gained 10.23% as of December 15.

Where will the money come from to pay the higher interest expense? The answer is simple – more debt and more money printing! We believe the gold knows this!

That's because the Oracle of Omaha has been running circles around Wall Street's major indexes for more than a half-century. Since taking the reins at Berkshire, Buffett has doubled the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 (19.8% vs. 9.9%), as of the end of 2022."", ""Yet what's particularly noteworthy about Buffett's success is that it's the result of prescient investments in a relatively small number of companies. Based on a combination of reported and estimated cost bases, Wall Street's most-revered investor and his team are sitting on $196.2 billion in unrealized gains (not counting dividends received) from just four well-known companies."", ""Perhaps this comes as no surprise, but the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's $364 billion investment portfolio has been one heck of an investment. Based on the $39.62-per-share cost basis estimated by WhaleWisdom.com, tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is responsible for a greater than $140 billion unrealized gain for Buffett's company. Not bad for a stock that Berkshire has been holding for less than eight years."", ""Apple's greatness largely derives from its innovation. It's been a leading provider of smartphones since introducing the original iPhone in 2007. In the U.S., it's consistently accounted for half or more of smartphone market share since upgrading the iPhone to handle 5G download speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020."", ""But what investors seem most excited about is Apple's ongoing evolution. Under CEO Tim Cook, Apple is becoming a platforms company that's emphasizing subscription services."", ""Make no mistake, Apple has exceptionally loyal customers and plenty of pricing power. It's also not abandoning the physical products that consumers obviously love (iPhone, Mac, and iPad). However, bolstering its portfolio to include subscription services will increase its operating margin over time, further enhance loyalty to Apple's ecosystem of products and services, and is expected to smooth out the revenue lumpiness associated with major iPhone upgrade cycles."", ""Although it trails Apple by a wide margin, credit-services provider American Express (NYSE: AXP) has been nothing short of an incredible investment for Warren Buffett and his team, which included the late, great Charlie Munger. With Berkshire reporting a cost basis in AmEx of approximately $8.49 per share, Buffett's company is sitting on more than $24 billion in unrealized gains, not including dividends."", ""American Express's success as a business is a function of its ability to play both sides of the transaction aisle. In addition to being the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., AmEx is a lender to businesses and consumers. This allows it to collect interest income and/or annual fees from its cardholders."", 'Something else working in favor of American Express is its choice to focus on high-earning consumers. Well-to-do cardholders are far less likely to alter their spending habits or fail to pay their bills than the average American. This positions AmEx to navigate economic downturns better than its peers.', ""Don't forget that macroeconomic factors are also AmEx's friend. Although financial stocks are cyclical and struggle during periods of contraction, recessions are short-lived. Only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months, and none have surpassed 18 months. Meanwhile, two economic expansions over the past 78 years have endured longer than a decade. Financial stocks like American Express benefit from long-winded periods of expansion."", ""The third Buffett stock that's generated a veritable smorgasbord of gains for the Oracle of Omaha's company is beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coke is Berkshire's longest continuous holding (since 1988) and sports a cost basis of just $3.2475 per share. With a current share price north of $59, it means Buffett and his investing aides are sitting on gains of well over $22 billion."", ""Also, keep in mind that Coca-Cola has raised its base annual dividend for 61 consecutive years, and is currently doling out $1.84 per share. Relative to Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis, Buffett's company is netting a nearly 57% yield on cost. Put another way, the Oracle of Omaha's company is more than doubling its initial investment in Coca-Cola every two years based solely on the dividend income it's receiving."", 'Geographic diversity is a big reason Coca-Cola has been such a bubbling investment for the past 35 years. Aside from North Korea, Cuba, and Russia, it has operations in every other country. This allows Coke to generate predictable operating cash flow in developed markets, while also benefiting from stronger organic growth opportunities in emerging market countries. The company has 26 brands generating at least $1 billion in worldwide sales.', ""Coca-Cola's other source of success is its top-tier marketing. It's been aggressively investing in digital advertising and relying on artificial intelligence to cater ads to younger audiences. Meanwhile, Coke has decades-long ties to the holidays and can lean on well-known brand ambassadors to connect with more mature consumers."", ""The fourth and final stock that, collectively with Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola, is responsible for generating more than $196 billion in unrealized gains for Warren Buffett and his team is credit-rating agency Moody's (NYSE: MCO)."", ""The theme of this list tends to be patience. Apple's large gains are a function of its outperformance since Berkshire's initial investment in the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, AmEx, Coca-Cola, and Moody's have been continuous holdings since 1991, 1988, and 2000, respectively. It's the epitome of allowing time and compounding to work their magic."", ""According to Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders that was released last year, Berkshire has a per-share cost basis of $10.05 in Moody's. With Moody's stock climbing above $377 on Dec. 11, it means Berkshire stake has increased in value by more than $9 billion, not including dividends paid."", ""For more than a decade, Moody's credit-rating segment has been its driving force. Historically low interest rates encouraged companies to borrow in order to hire, acquire, innovate, and expand. The need to rate new debt issuances kept Moody's analysts busy, as well as lined the company's pockets."", ""But things have changed as interest rates have soared over the past 21 months. With fewer corporate debt issuances, Moody's Analytics segment is now doing the heavy lifting. This division, which helps businesses stay compliant with regulations and assists with risk assessment, is perfectly positioned to thrive in the current economic climate."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price."", ""During the last half decade, Motorola Solutions became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Motorola Solutions share price has gained 82% in three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 31% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 22% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat."", 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', ""We know that Motorola Solutions has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on Motorola Solutions' balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Motorola Solutions' TSR for the last 5 years was 199%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""Motorola Solutions shareholders have received returns of 25% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 24%. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The two prototypes had entered orbit over the Atlantic Ocean at 2:24 p.m. Eastern on Oct. 6. An Amazon antenna on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius made contact with both, but during a subsequent handoff to another station, only one vehicle checked in. Amazon scanned the sky behind the first satellite for a signal from the second one but heard silence.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg', 'Hyperloop One to Shut Down After Failing to Reinvent Transit', 'Tencent Leads $80 Billion Rout as China Rekindles Crackdown Fear', 'Harvard Financial Pain Grows as Blavatnik Joins Donor Revolt', 'Vilified Zero-Day Options Blamed by Traders for S&P Decline', 'Giuliani Files for Bankruptcy After $148 Million Defamation Loss', 'The incident threatened to kill the mood for employees who’d gathered to celebrate the launch at Postdoc Brewing, not far from Amazon’s Seattle-area space operation. The team had spent years building satellites from scratch and endured months of delays launching them. Now that they were aloft, Amazon needed to make contact to ensure their solar panels had deployed. If not, the batteries would run out and the satellites would fail, a major setback for the retail and cloud-computing giant, already a late entrant in the race to build a profitable business selling internet access from low-Earth orbit.', 'Inside Amazon’s Mission Operations Center, a conference room stuffed with big video displays, computers and cases of energy drinks, satellite operations chief Yonina DeKeyser and her deputies worked to piece together the scraps of data they’d collected. Between the third and fourth contacts, the guidance, navigation and control team made the call: the missing satellite was fine. The information streaming in could only have come from a pair of healthy spacecraft. Rajeev Badyal, the project’s leader, yelled in triumph.', 'At the brewery, an Amazonian looking at his phone broke through the din, raising clenched fists as he bellowed “We’re power positive!” His colleagues cheered. The team would later discover that some of Amazon’s ground-based antennas had been looking in the wrong place, mistaking the second satellite to pass for the first.', 'Amazon executives tend to describe their satellite venture, Project Kuiper, in philanthropic terms, emphasizing its potential to connect people in remote or impoverished areas with education and global commerce. Less altruistically, Amazon also hopes the $10-billion-plus project can transform it into a global telecommunications giant. The company plans to sell rooftop antennas to individual internet users, cloud-computing and data-recovery services to business, and connectivity to wireless companies to link remote cell towers to their networks, starting in 2025.', 'Project Kuiper is among the Seattle-based company’s biggest bets, one of just a few that have survived two years into a cost-cutting drive that has eliminated many of the speculative projects started late in Jeff Bezos’s tenure as chief executive officer. It’s an enormous undertaking in an arena that has had more bankruptcies than successful businesses. Broadband is already widely available and, in many places where it isn’t, it’s not clear people will be able to afford space-based internet. Some Amazon observers see Project Kuiper as another front in the rivalry between Bezos and fellow billionaire Elon Musk, whose SpaceX operates the Starlink constellation of internet satellites.', 'Amazon is betting its system advances the state of the art, and can offer the capacity and internet speeds to compete not just with Starlink, which has a big head start, but with terrestrial telecommunications companies. At the very least, Amazon is building an alternative to Musk’s service at a time when governments and corporations alike are looking for ways to reduce their reliance on the erratic and controversial businessman.', 'Over the last two months, Amazon engineers have put their maiden satellites through a battery of tests. They’ve made a video call, bought a toy rocket set from Amazon.com and tested a system of lasers designed to extend the reach of each satellite. Now comes the really hard part. To meet the terms of its license with regulators, Amazon has to build—and find a ride to space for—the equivalent of two satellites a day, every day, through July 2026.', '“Building two satellites is very hard,” Badyal said. “Building 3,000-plus is exponentially harder.”', 'Project Kuiper, named for the belt of dwarf planets, ice and rock beyond Neptune, was born of a thought experiment, according to longtime Amazon consumer electronics chief Dave Limp. Bezos had periodically asked executives to ponder far-off hurdles that might slow the company down, an exercise that led Amazon to spend billions on warehouse robots and fleets of aircraft, big rigs and delivery trucks.', 'About six years ago, Amazon’s leaders grew fixated on broadband internet. Their disparate range of businesses, including retail sites, film studios and business software, all depend on access to the web. “It became, if you wanted to grow, you had to find these hundreds of millions of people that are not currently Amazon customers,” Limp said in an interview. “Well, what’s the constraint to getting them there?”', 'Read more: How Musk’s Starlink Sparked a New Kind of Space Race', 'Among other ideas, Amazon explored internet-broadcasting drones and balloons, approaches tried and abandoned by Facebook, now Meta Platforms Inc., and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Amazon decided to deliver the internet from satellites.', 'The idea wasn’t novel. In the 1990s, not far from the suburban Seattle garage where Bezos founded Amazon, a company called Teledesic had set out to launch a constellation of hundreds of satellites. Most communications satellites at the time rested in a geostationary orbit, which matched the Earth’s rotation, fixing each craft in place from the perspective of someone on the ground. Such satellites power the global positioning system, weather tracking and in-flight web browsing.', 'Teledesic figured satellites in a much lower orbit, the domain of space stations, could take advantage of the shorter trip to the ground to better compete with terrestrial phone and internet companies. Despite backing from Microsoft Corp.’s Bill Gates and wireless mogul Craig McCaw, the company folded after the dotcom bust. Rockets were expensive, and the aerospace industry preferred to keep making bespoke satellites for governments.', 'About a decade later, Musk took up the idea and cut out the middlemen. His rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., was reducing the cost of getting to orbit, and opted to build satellites in-house. Musk hired Badyal, the future Kuiper chief, to bring that to life.', 'Badyal was born in India and spent much of his childhood in Kuwait, where his architect father was posted. He came to the US for college, earning a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oregon State University. He found work at a nearby Hewlett Packard campus, helping design the printhead that transfers ink to the page on inkjet printers. Later, he worked on the first optical mice, sparing future generations the task of cleaning a grimy tracking ball, before moving to Microsoft, where he helped create the company’s ill-fated Zune music player.', 'Rapid technological advances in consumer electronics made it possible for companies outside the aerospace industry to build satellites. People like Badyal, adept at navigating on-the-fly design changes and mass manufacturing, had the right tools for a new generation of satellites that could be built quickly and on the cheap. After joining the Starlink project in 2014, Badyal set up shop in exurban Redmond, Washington. The first two satellites launched on a SpaceX rocket four years later.', 'In June of 2018, Musk flew to Seattle. Soon after, Badyal and much of his team were out. Colleagues were told they’d been fired. Badyal says he and Musk simply decided to part ways. Musk put another lieutenant in charge and ordered him to strip the design down to the bare minimum in an effort to get a barebones system operating as quickly as possible. Today, SpaceX says it’s building six satellites a day. There are more than 5,000 in orbit, serving more than 2 million customers.', 'It’s a Bezos maxim that Amazon only enters new fields when it has expertise—or can acquire it quickly. Amazon’s satellite initiative was a two-page outline when Limp heard Starlink’s founding team was looking for work. He called Badyal in August 2018.', 'Two months later, Badyal and five fellow Starlink alums were at Amazon, sketching out a new constellation in a pair of conference rooms obscured by a black curtain that curious employees saw as an invitation to pop their heads through. “It was very secure,” deadpanned Naveen Kachroo, one of the first hires. When their plan—3,236 satellites crisscrossing the globe at an altitude of between 590 to 630 kilometers—became public months later, Musk called Bezos a copycat on Twitter.', 'Amazon engineers designed a terminal, the gadget that customers will someday use to receive data from satellites, that they figured they could manufacture for about $750. Bezos sent them back to the drawing board. It needed to be even cheaper. Amazon’s antenna chief, Nima Mahanfar, and his team combined some antenna functions, and the company says it can now build its main, 11-inch-square terminal, for less than $400. It offers internet speeds of up to 400 megabits per second, roughly twice the median broadband speed in US homes.', 'Project Kuiper employs more than 1,600 people, a mix of consumer electronics veterans and career aerospace experts. DeKeyser, the satellite operations chief, holds a master’s in aeronautical engineering and says winding up at Amazon would have been unfathomable earlier in her career. The team is the rare organization inside Amazon run mostly by people who hail from elsewhere. Chief satellite engineer Paul O’Brien, Kachroo and Mahanfar all worked on Microsoft’s Zune.', '“You have to innovate at a much faster pace” than traditional space manufacturing, said Badyal, a mustachioed, gray-haired engineer with a gravelly voice and a thing for classic cocktails. His office at Project Kuiper headquarters in Redmond, in a building that once made forklifts, overlooks a research and development lab where engineers fabricate custom aluminum parts, assemble circuit boards and test antennas in a cavernous echo-free chamber.', 'Amazon’s satellites pair technology that pushes the cutting edge—including optical satellite links, more commonly called space lasers—with simple, proven components that limit cost or weight. “Kuiper is designing spacecraft that are fewer in number, bigger in size, higher in power” than SpaceX’s first generation of vehicles, said Caleb Henry, who tracks private-sector space companies for Quilty Space. “There’s a real difference in design philosophy between the two.”', 'The satellites will enter space packed inside the nose of a rocket and start their first orbit in a tumble until an automated system reorients them toward Earth. By that point, the solar panels, folded at launch, should be deploying automatically, relying on an almost century-old technology: actuators that heat a plug of wax, which expands to push on a bolt that releases the array.', 'When a customer loads a website, the home terminal beams a signal up to a circular array of thousands of antenna modules, which look like tiny, green two-dot Legos. Bowl-shaped gateway antennas route the request down to Amazon’s ground stations, the conduit to the internet. Responsive data is fired back upward, and then down to the terminal from one of the set of arrays of Lego bricks.', 'All of this happens in milliseconds as the craft speeds by at 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kph). By the time the satellite zooms out of sight, another should be in view. Each has its own propulsion system. Amazonians liken the power of the thruster to a flap of a dragonfly’s wings, which, fired for hours in the vacuum of space, can overcome gravity’s pull.', 'Amazon at one point aimed to produce the satellites for $500,000 apiece, and keep their weight under 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds), according to two people familiar with the matter. The size and weight of Amazon’s upcoming production models couldn’t be learned. Based on Amazon’s launch vehicles, Quilty Space estimates Kuiper satellites weigh between 600 and 800 kilograms. A photo Amazon published of its prototypes en route to launch showed each enclosed in a cubical steel crate about the height of a human.', 'Kachroo, now Kuiper’s business development chief, says Amazon will sell connectivity directly to individual internet users, as well as through wireless and broadband service providers, depending on the country. Amazon has announced partnerships with Verizon Communications Inc. in the US, Vodafone Group Plc in Europe and Africa, and Japan’s NTT. Service tests will start in the second half of next year, and Amazon ultimately anticipates selling to tens of millions of customers.', '“We want to serve enterprise, governments, schools, hospitals, mobile operators, so we don’t have a single channel, or segment, on which we make money,” said Kachroo. Amazon, which hasn’t disclosed pricing, has licenses so far to operate in more than 15 countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico and the US.', 'The company will offer businesses and governments private connectivity through its Amazon Web Services unit, and make service quality guarantees that SpaceX has yet to offer. AWS, the largest seller of rented computing power and data storage, will in the coming years be able to offer packages of products that include internet access, a perk that Amazon’s cloud-computing rivals can’t match on their own.', 'Kuiper staff tend not to bring up Starlink (another Bezosism: don’t obsess over the competition), but analysts say Amazon has an opportunity to set itself apart simply by operating a satellite business devoid of Musk’s personal drama or business entanglements. Other companies are building what the industry calls megaconstellations, but Starlink’s is by far the largest and most capable.', 'Officials in Taiwan, seeking backup internet access in the event of war with China, are wary of relying on Musk, who has business ties with Beijing, Bloomberg has reported. In Ukraine, Starlink has been a lifeline following Russia’s invasion, but earlier this year it emerged that Musk refused a request from Kyiv to expand coverage to enable a Ukrainian advance. The world’s richest man has urged an end to the conflict on terms favorable to Russia, and his biographer published text messages between Musk and Ukraine’s deputy prime minister.', 'SpaceX, which didn’t respond to requests for comment, also avoids the long-term contracts and exclusivity agreements that business customers tend to seek, said Lluc Palerm, an analyst with researcher NSR. “They are not perceived as the best partner in the industry,”', 'In an interview, Julie Zoller, Kuiper’s regulatory chief, didn’t specify how Amazon would navigate political entanglements, saying the company would defer to the State Department. Zoller, who started her career installing satellite gear at US military bases, did concede that Amazon doesn’t envision Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy negotiating service terms by text message. “Customers are literally saying ‘Why can’t you all go faster,’” Kachroo said. “They love the fact that there’s competition.”', 'Executives insist Kuiper is on schedule, but the company hoped to have its prototypes aloft almost a year earlier. The proof is in orbit: etched onto an aluminum body component of each craft are the names of the people working on the project as of August 2022.', 'Amazon’s initial ride to space—on a new rocket built by a startup—exploded on the launch pad. Its second, the new Vulcan Centaur built by United Launch Alliance, the US space stalwart, was supposed to take off this summer before an explosion during testing. Desperate to get its satellites flying, Amazon chartered an Atlas V, a 21-year-old ULA rocket capable of carrying much heavier loads. The launch was the rocketry equivalent of hiring a city bus to take two people to the movies.', 'Now Amazon has to get the rest of the satellites up there. Project Kuiper’s is the biggest commercial launch order in history, which in addition to 47 ULA launches, includes rockets from ArianeGroup and Bezos’s Blue Origin. But only one of those rockets—the Atlas, which Amazon has booked for eight more launches—has flown. Blue Origin has never sent a spacecraft to orbit, and the rocket it hopes to get there is years behind schedule. (Limp, Badyal’s old boss, left Amazon this month to lead Blue Origin.)', 'Earlier this month, Amazon booked three launches with SpaceX, an awkward deal necessitated by Kuiper’s tight launch schedule and the lack of alternatives. Amazon says it has been in discussions with every major launch provider for years. It also denies the decision was influenced by a lawsuit filed by a pension fund alleging Amazon didn’t consider using SpaceX thanks in part to the Bezos-Musk rivalry—pushing up costs. Amazon says the claims are without merit.', 'ULA is expanding a factory in Alabama, and retrofitting a facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to quickly stack Kuiper satellites on rockets and ferry them to the launchpad. Suppliers of rocket motors and avionics equipment are ramping up production. “It’s all on track to be done in time,” said ULA CEO Tory Bruno. “As long as we don’t have to completely change the design, we’re going to be fine.”', 'However Amazon’s satellites get to space, Project Kuiper’s Federal Communications Commission license requires that 1,618 of them be there by July 2026, and the other half three years later. Amazon plans to build them at a dedicated manufacturing site in Kirkland, Washington, where crews are still installing machinery and doing utility work. So Amazon’s first satellites are being assembled at Kuiper’s headquarters, which is being reconfigured from a research and development facility into a crash production line.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'One Man’s Longevity Obsession Now Includes Fountain-of-Youth Injections', 'What Dermatologists Really Think About Those Anti-Aging Products', 'The Most Secretive Longevity Lab Finally Opens Its Doors', 'What the Oldest Lab Rodents Are Teaching Humans About Staying Young', 'Michael J.

But when a pharmacist errs, the implications can be both legal – pharmacists can be sued for malpractice – and lethal. Errors can cost lives, tie pharmacists up in prolonged court battles and cost them their livelihoods.', 'A 2022 National Community Pharmacists Association survey showed that nearly 75% of respondents felt they did not have enough time to safely perform clinical duties and patient care.', 'It’s worries like these that led some pharmacists to walk out of CVS and Walgreens stores pharmacies this autumn, workers told CNN.', 'Stores increasingly operate with just one pharmacist behind the counter for a 12-hour shift. “They didn’t feel confident that they could provide care in a safe environment,” said Michael Hogue, CEO of the American Pharmacists Association.', '“Pharmacists are so overwhelmed and worried that they’re going to make a mistake. It’s so easy to make a mistake under those conditions,” said Shane Jerominski, a pharmacist and labor advocate who spent a decade working at chain pharmacies including Walgreens and CVS.', 'There’s a general misconception about what it takes to correctly fill a prescription — the work goes beyond just putting pills into a bottle.', 'Pharmacists check prescriptions they receive from doctor’s offices for possible errors, match details on prescriptions to patient profiles, check for possible drug interactions, bill insurance companies and counsel patients.', 'If a particular medication isn’t covered by insurance, pharmacists call doctor’s offices to try to get prior authorization or switch medications. All of that is done in between giving vaccines, ringing up and counseling customers and answering questions about over-the-counter medications.', 'There’s a lot of room for error and the repercussions are stark.', 'Between 7,000 to 9,000 people die in the United States as a result of a medication error each year, according to a recent National Institutes of Health study. Hundreds of thousands of other patients experience but often do not report an adverse reaction or other medication complications, the study found.', 'The cost of looking after patients with medication-associated errors is more than $40 billion each year, according to the study.', '“It’s the nightmare for a pharmacist who’s had a busy shift and then goes home and processes what’s happened,” said Karl Williams, a professor of pharmacy law, ethics and counseling at the Wegmans School of Pharmacy at St. John Fisher University. “To wake up and think ‘did i remember to tell a patient about a particular risk?’ It drives people to leave the practice whether there are legal ramifications or not. If a patient has been harmed, it’s just a horrible outcome.”', 'The ramifications of pharmacy errors can extend well beyond moral consequences for pharmacists.', 'Pharmacists, said Williams, can be held responsible legally for any injuries that result from a medication error. Even if the pharmacist works for a large company with access to insurance protection and top lawyers, he said, “there’s still joint liability.”', 'That’s because a pharmacist is a licensed professional, he said. “The pharmacist doesn’t become immune from that just because the employer is hiring an attorney.

CVS provided about 25% of all prescriptions, while Walgreens accounted for another 20%.', 'Large pharmacies typically have liability insurance that they extend to their employees, said Gina Moore, a professor at the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of Colorado.', 'When a pharmacist is “particularly negligent” they might be held individually responsible, but those cases are very rare, she said.', 'But pharmacists also face what Williams calls “administrative liability.”', 'Once a pharmacist gets sued, the information becomes public. At that point, the pharmacy licensing agency gets notified and can take action against the pharmacist by removing their license — thus effectively ending their career.', 'Still, while many pharmacies track medication errors internally, there is no federal agency that requires them to report those errors.', 'If a pharmacy or patient does report an issue, a group called the National Practitioner Data Bank also collects information about civil liability and administrative liability cases.', 'That information then becomes available to employers, insurance companies and other interested parties. That means pharmacists who are sued can be excluded from participating in federal government healthcare programs, Medicaid and Medicare, “which ends their career basically, even if they retain their license,” said Williams. “If they’re excluded from participation in Medicaid and Medicare, they can’t be employed by a pharmacy anymore.”', 'It typically takes about four years of post-undergraduate study to become a pharmacist which can cost students more than $200,000.', 'Tony Bertolino, managing partner at Texas-based Bertolino LLP, a law firm that specializes in defending pharmacies and pharmacists, says his clients often make mistakes because of fatigue from working long hours.', '“Any simple mistake: the counting of medication, or even issuing the wrong type of medication could have serious impacts and even cause a death,” he said. “There’s so much pressure on pharmacists to get prescriptions filled and to get patients in and out.”', 'But it doesn’t matter if a pharmacist is overworked and overburdened, he added. The language of liability for pharmacy regulations is strict.', '“There’s really no need for the element of intent to be proven. If you break the law or violate a rule, you’re on the hook.

Each of these five corporations boast a remarkable streak, having increased their dividends to shareholders every year for at least 67 years.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with PH.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', ""This analysis highlights another member of this elite group: Parker-Hannifin Corp. (NYSE:PH). Like the other five companies mentioned above, Parker-Hannifin has an impressive record of 67 years of uninterrupted dividend growth. The company's shareholders have benefited from the dual advantages of long-term dividend growth and increasing share prices."", 'A global leader in motion and control technologies, the company operates in two main segments: Diversified industrial and Aerospace Systems.', ""In 2023, the Diversified Industrial segment was the primary revenue driver, contributing about $14.7 billion, or approximately 77% of the company's total revenue. This segment also generated over $3 billion in operating earnings, achieving an operating margin of over 20%."", 'In contrast, the Aerospace Systems segment brought in $4.36 billion in revenue, with a significantly lower operating income of $562 million, resulting in an operating margin of around 12%.', ""Investors might be concerned about Parker-Hannifin's growing leverage in recent years. The company's short-term and long-term debt levels have slightly increased, reaching $12.2 billion, while the total shareholders' equity came in at $10.56 billion. Over the past decade, there has been a notable shift in its financial stability: the debt-to-equity ratio climbed from 0.49 to 1.22, while the interest coverage ratio decreased from a high of 16.7 to 5.48 in 2023. Despite this decline, the current interest coverage of 5.48 is still reasonably strong, indicating the company can comfortably cover its interest expenses."", ""Parker-Hannifin's ability to generate cash flow is an attractive feature for investors. The company has shown a consistent upward trend in its free cash flow. From 2012 to 2023, its operating cash flow grew from $1.19 billion to nearly $3 billion, marking a compounded annual growth rate of 9.7%. Its free cash flow has also seen impressive growth over the past decade, growing from $925 million to nearly $2.6 billion in the same period, enjoying an annual compounded growth rate of 10.9%."", ""Looking forward, Parker-Hannifin should experience more business growth, bolstered by favorable market trends in the aerospace industry. This growth is driven by two key factors: the resurgence in commercial air traffic and consistent defense spending. A pivotal development supporting this trend is the shift by major clients like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (XPAR:AIR) toward more efficient narrowbody aircraft. This shift aligns perfectly with Parker-Hannifin's business offerings, positioning the company to capitalize on these industry changes."", ""President Biden's recent proposal in August to allocate an additional $20 billion in military aid and assistance to Ukraine presents new opportunities for the company. This proposal will likely benefit the company's business, especially given its history of securing significant government contracts."", ""Highlighting its ability in this area, Parker-Hannifin secured a crucial five-year maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) contract with the U.S. Army in May of this year. The contract demonstrates the company's ability to meet the demanding requirements of government projects and reinforces its strong position within the aerospace sector."", ""A key metric to consider when assessing a company's ability to maintain its dividend payments is the dividend payout ratio. This ratio, calculated as earnings per share divided by dividend per share, indicates whether a company's annual dividend payment is sustainably covered by its earnings for that year. A dividend payout ratio exceeding 100% is a cautionary sign for investors. It implies the company is returning more money to shareholders than it has earned in that year. If this trend persists, the company may eventually need to reduce or even discontinue its dividend payments. This metric is crucial for evaluating the long-term sustainability of a company's dividend policy."", ""Looking at Parker-Hannifin's history, the company has kept its dividend payout ratio well under 1 for the past 20 years. Since 2003, this ratio has remained in a comfortable range of 0.15 to 0.46, illustrating a consistent and prudent dividend policy. In 2023, the payout ratio was just 0.25, further demonstrating the company's effective management of its dividends in relation to its earnings. This track record underscores the company's long-term commitment to maintaining a sustainable dividend policy."", 'In the past 20 years, the company has grown its dividend per share from 49 cents to $5.47, translating into a high 12.8% CAGR . The Gordon Growth Model, which is suitable for companies with consistent dividend growth, fits well with Parker-Hannifin considering its remarkable history of nearly seven decades of dividend growth. Assuming the company maintains a slightly lower dividend growth rate of about 12%compared to its annual growth rate over the past 20 yearsand applying a discount rate of 13%, we can calculate the intrinsic value of Parker-Hannifin as follows:', 'P = Expected Dividend for 2024 / (Required Rate of Return - Dividend Growth Rate)', '= $5.47 *(1+12%) / (13%-12%)', '= $612.6', ""Using the Gordon Growth Model, the intrinsic value of Parker-Hannifin is estimated to be approximately $612.60 per share. This valuation is 40% higher than its current share price of $439. Such a significant difference suggests the market may undervalue the company's potential for future growth and dividend increases."", 'Parker-Hannifin stands out as a prime example of a Dividend Aristocrat with a solid 67-year history of increasing dividends. Despite growing leverage, its robust cash flow and low dividend payout ratio, coupled with a promising outlook in the aerospace and defense sectors, underscore its potential for stability and growth.', ""The Gordon Growth Model's valuation suggests Parker-Hannifin's current market price may not fully reflect its long-term value and capacity for consistent shareholder returns, marking it as a potentially undervalued investment opportunity."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

GIS is scheduled to come up with second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Dec 20. Let’s take a closer look at the company’s Pet segment, which constituted nearly 12% of its total sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.', 'Although General Mills’ Pet segment has been driving the company’s performance, the unit is likely to have witnessed some hurdles in the quarter to be reported.', 'General Mills, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Mills, Inc. Quote', 'GIS is bearing the brunt of the lower impacts of inflation-justified pricing, along with consumers’ shift toward value products stemming from an uncertain economic landscape. The company’s Pet segment retail sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were somewhat affected by these aspects, including pet parents’ shift toward value products and channels, along with smaller pack sizes.Additionally, GIS is witnessing challenges in the wet food and treats categories, with pet parents spending more time at work or away from home. In the first quarter, segment sales remained flat year over year at $580 million as pricing was countered by soft pound volumes.On its last earnings call, management stated that it expects the difficult category dynamics to persist in the Pet segment throughout fiscal 2024 as it does not see any major change in the economic viewpoint for pet parents in the near term. This remains a concern for the quarter under review.Our model suggests Pet segment revenues will grow 4.5% to $619.6 million in the second quarter and form 11.4% of the company’s total revenues.General Mills’ Pet segment mainly constitutes Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc., which was acquired by GIS in fiscal 2018. Following this acquisition, General Mills became one of the leading players in the pet food arena. Blue Buffalo manufactures and markets wholesome natural pet food items and is contributing to General Mills’ top line. Additionally, GIS acquired Tyson Foods’ pet treats business in July 2021, which added another leaf to the company’s impressive Pet story.', 'General Mills’ commitment to its three priorities as part of its Accelerate strategy is likely to have aided in the quarter under review. These include competing efficiently through brand building and innovation, enhancing the supply chain by boosting Holistic Margin Management cost savings and curtailing costs, undertaking efficient capital allocation, rewarding shareholders and staying committed to reshaping the portfolio via strategic acquisitions and divestitures.Apart from this, General Mills’ input cost inflation has been moderating. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that the biggest factors impacting its performance in fiscal 2024 are likely to be consumers’ economic status, the moderating rate of cost inflation and the rising stability of supply-chain status. However, continued brand investments may have escalated SG&A expenses in the second quarter.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.3 billion, suggesting an increase of 2.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has dropped by a penny, unchanged in the past seven days to $1.15 per share. This indicates a rise of 4.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

Still, the carrier disclosed in October that federal officials found its efforts fell short and the carrier could face a civil penalty over its service to customers.', 'The settlement provides that in addition to the $35 million fine, Southwest will get $33 million in credit for compensation already handed out, mostly for giving 25,000 frequent flyer points each, worth about $300, to affected customers. The company promised to give out $90 million in vouchers to future travelers.', 'Starting next spring and running until April 2027, Southwest will provide a voucher of at least $75 to travelers who request them if they reach their destination at least three hours late because of a delay or flight cancellation caused by the airline.', 'The government values vouchers at 80% of their face value, so Southwest received credit for $72 million for the future vouchers, not the full $90 million to be distributed over three years. If Southwest pays out less than $30 million in any of those years, it will owe the government a penalty of 80% of any shortfall.', 'In exchange for Southwest agreeing to the fine and other measures, the government stopped short of deciding whether the airline advertised a flight schedule that it knew could not be kept. Buttigieg had raised that charge publicly.', 'The Transportation Department said it reviewed thousands of consumer complaints, visited Southwest facilities and met with senior company officials during the investigation.']"

If you want to skip our overview of the real estate sector and the latest news, then take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. ', ""In today's high interest rate environment, the real estate sector has been one of the most dynamic industries. Like banking, real estate is also quite sensitive to high rates as they impact the demand for properties and also make financing new and existing projects costlier. This has been evident in the commercial and office real estate industry, as the growth in work from home trends combined with high rates has shaken up the environment in which these companies operate."", ""To understand the scope of the downturn in the office real estate industry, consider the American Institute of Architects (AIA)'s AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index. Like production indexes that measure the size of activity in industries, this index measures the business that architecture firms receive. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the sector, and during October, the ABI stood at 44.3 to mark a nearly three year low reading that eclipsed the downturn in the segment in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic's disruptions were at their peak. More worryingly, the architecture firms also reported that not only did the value of new contracts drop for the third consecutive month, but inquiries for new projects dropped for the first time since July 2020."", 'Building on this, the chief executive officer of the asset manager TCW Group - who is a major bondholder in the real estate market - believes that the commercial real estate market is due for a serious shakeup. Speaking to CNBC, Katie Koch shared in October 2023 that as much as one third of existing office space will be removed from the market in order to readjust it to the current status quo. According to her, this resizing will be focused primarily on non top tier office properties, a view that was also presented by the Washington, D.C. based real estate market data and intelligence provider CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP).', ""CoStar's analysis believes that even though commercial real estate is undergoing seismic level shifts, ironically, these changes will also increase the demand for top tier, Grade A office properties. This is because as the office real estate market shrinks, the demand for existing products will increase. When combined with a return to normalcy for working trends, big ticket firms will be eager to get their hands on lucrative properties and consequently drive up their demand."", ""Shifting gears, another real estate sector that's been in the news a lot in 2023 is the residential sector. Residential real estate companies faced a roaring market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as low rates and growing work from home trends incentivized workers to buy homes in suburban and other localities. This helped them beef up their margins and offer low mortgage rates later on even after the Federal Reserve's multiple 75 basis point interest rate hikes. In fact, the hype surrounding the residential real estate sector reached a feverish pitch in August when the Q2 2023 hedge fund filings started to roll in. They showed that none other than Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway piled into the real estate sector. During Q2, the Oracle of Omaha pumped $814 million into three home building companies.

Over these time -- over time, these steps will hopefully bring inflation to desired levels. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in a more orderly fashion. And while the Fed is working to reduce overall capital levels, the elimination of sharp turns and aggressive moves is generally constructive to consumers finding access to enough capital for their necessities, and housing is a necessity.', 'Against that backdrop, the current housing market is generally defined by a very short supply of affordable products and strong demand for affordable products. The consumers have now adjusted to and accepted ""higher for longer"" interest rates and are willing to purchase or rent what they can afford. The consumer is employed and is confident they will remain employed and likely with a higher wage. Higher rates, with need driving demand and housing in short supply, is the new normal, and the consumer understands that the cost of housing will likely continue to be higher. Generally speaking, strong demand for housing has returned within the limits of affordability. The market has attracted consumers by adjusting prices, increasing incentives, including rate buy-downs, and driving down production costs in order to enable consumers to afford needed shelter, and customers have responded.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most profitable real estate stocks.

Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank all experienced collapses attributed to a devaluation of their asset portfolios. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy triggered the flight of substantial uninsured deposits seeking safety and better returns elsewhere. There were concerns that this could lead to contagion affecting other segments of the banking industry. However, as of now, such an event hasn't occurred."", ""With that said, banking institutions are keeping their eyes peeled for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, which is anticipated to maintain the current interest rates. In addition, investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring the Fed's tone for clues about the potential timing of rate adjustments. Bolstered by a robust monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which surpassed expectations for new job additions in November, along with this year's lowest core PCE increase, major US stock indices concluded another week with positive gains. This marks six consecutive weeks of growth, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices reaching their highest levels since early 2022 and closing 20.4% and 38.67% higher on December 8, respectively."", 'Anticipating a move by the Federal Reserve, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), for instance, foresees the S&P 500 reaching 5,000 in 2024, asserting that ""we are past maximum macro uncertainty,"" and stating that the market has absorbed a considerable amount of uncertainty and negative news.', 'In any case, the current situation where well-established banks with a longstanding presence in both the US and international markets are trading below their usual levels could serve as motivation for investors to consider allocating their funds to the banking sector.

In contrast, the select, large banks we own, including\xa0U.S. Bancorp, actually saw deposit inflows and increasing profits, reinforcing our thesis that high-quality financial services companies remain among the most misunderstood and attractive sectors of the market. This stress test models a dramatic recession—one meaningfully worse than the great financial crisis of 2008-2009. It includes a 3.5% decline in gross domestic product, a 10% unemployment rate, a 37% decline in residential real estate, a 40% decline in commercial real estate and a 55% decline in the stock market. The resilience and strength required to weather such an economic storm combined with proven economies of scale in branding and technology should drive DNYVF market share gains and growth for years to come. Trading at some of the lowest valuations in the market, our financial sector holdings—such as\xa0U.S. Bancorp, deserve to be revalued upwards over time.

At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America. All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy.

The order has led to favorable conditions for the formation of large holding companies. Although holding companies have always been a reality of the business, their definition, motivations for existing, and size have changed dramatically in the past few decades. A holding company usually exists to control other firms.\xa0', 'It is important to take a deeper dive into the exact definition of holding firms to clear ambiguities regarding their existence. Holding companies are formed to control other firms, and do not generally manufacture products, offer day-to-day business services, or carry out any business operations. Although holding firms can hire and fire managers of subsidiaries - the firms the holding company controls - the subsidiaries remain separate entities in terms of their operations. This shields the parent firm from the liabilities of the subsidiary.\xa0', 'Holding companies may also be formed in some cases for tax benefits. For example, if the parent company of a subsidiary is located in a lower tax region, it would help avoid higher taxes on the parent even if the subsidiary were located in another region. Other benefits offered by holding firms include central management for better control, branding appeal, and flexibility in terms of financial investments. Some of the top holding companies in the world today include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).\xa0', 'The incredible rise of holding firms can be better understood in the context of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), a multinational conglomerate led by veteran investor Warren Buffett that has a market capitalization of close to $800 billion. Over the past five years, the shares of the firm have returned more than 89% to investors, closely mirroring the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 that has returned 90% to investors during the same time period. During a recent earnings call, the company urged investors to look past fluctuations in the portfolio.', '“The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules. To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation.

I can't promise exactly when, but by golly, this stock is undervalued for all the wrong reasons and ready to run as soon as the market makers realize what they've been missing. You know?"", ""But some of these potential jumps may be short-lived. Perhaps that magical growth catalyst is a one-time event, never to be repeated, that won't leave any lasting benefits for the target company. And it's not easy to pin down the best time to sell these gadfly rocket ships. Miss the peak by a day or two, and your coveted win may evaporate before you cash in the winning chips. Nailing the top of a temporary spike is pretty much impossible -- just ask master investor Warren Buffett."", ""So what I really want to find on my daily treks through Wall Street is a stock that looks ready to deliver robust price gains -- with staying power for the long haul. I don't even care if the next big jump is coming next week or two years from now, as long as I can be reasonably sure that the shares should gain value over time."", ""In my view, the perfect stock belongs to a company in the early days of an unstoppable growth story, and the price-setting market makers insist that it's not going to work. As a result, the stock under my microscope in this case would deserve a much higher price as the growth story plays out."", ""If you bought Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) stock in the low-price paradise of the Qwikster debacle in 2011, you're speaking my language. The Netflix shares I added in October that year have posted a 3,850% gain so far, and I never doubted the long-term outcome. Switching the business focus from DVD mailers to digital video streams was the right idea, even if the shift was executed with the grace of a newborn moose on black ice."", ""I didn't dare -- and would never recommend -- betting the whole farm on Netflix back then, but it was a no-brainer move to add some more shares of the entertainment pioneer to a diversified portfolio."", ""So let me show you two of the absolute best buys in today's market, based on that analysis of undervalued growth stocks offering tremendous long-term value for shareholders. Like Netflix in 2011, they strike me as future juggernauts with low stock prices today. Buy them now, hold them forever, and watch your wealth grow over time. That's the idea."", 'The first name on my list of essentially eternal growth stories is Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). The e-commerce and cloud computing colossus needs no introduction. I\'m sure you already heard that management always wants to run the company as if it\'s ""day one"" with a brand new start-up.', ""That attitude shows in Amazon's business results. Sales added up to a massive $281 billion in fiscal year 2019. Why stop there? Today, Amazon's revenues over the last four quarters work out to $554 billion. That's a 97% increase in less than four years."", 'And just like a hungry little start-up, Amazon is happy to invest in growth-boosting ideas even if it results in soft or negative profits in the short term. Unadjusted earnings and free cash flows were printed in red ink last year as Amazon invested billions of dollars in its one-day shipping network and the Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform. Just another year in the history of a company that always puts the customer experience first, at any cost.', '""We realize that we exist to make customers\' lives better and easier every day, and relentlessly want to do so,"" CEO Andy Jassy said in last year\'s fourth-quarter earnings call. ""And being maniacally focused on the customer experiences is always going to be a top priority for us.""', ""That's exactly what I want to hear from the leaders of a trillion-dollar company. Push that pedal to the metal until you have exhausted the opportunity for further growth. Even then, I'd rather see the company taking a sharp left turn into a greater long-term opportunity than settle down for slow growth and generous dividends. Stop me if you've heard this before, but Netflix did exactly that in 2011."", ""And of course, that forward-looking plan isn't always popular with Wall Street's market makers. Amazon's shares have posted a solid 79% gain year-to-date but the stock still sits 21% below the all-time highs in the summer of 2021. If you pick up some Amazon shares at this comfortable price point, I expect that investment to serve you well for decades to come."", ""Alongside the giant Amazon, there's Toast (NYSE: TOST), a disruptive challenger in the restaurant tech space."", ""Currently trading at 2.5 times sales and down 6.6% year-to-date, Toast's market value belies its potential. It's not just a blip on the radar. Toast is transforming how restaurants operate, from point-of-sale to payroll."", ""And the company isn't afraid to try some unique tactics. For example, Toast recently infused some artificial intelligence (AI) smarts into its services by adding a voice-controlled assistant. The AI-powered tool from SoundHound (NASDAQ: SOUN) can take orders over the phone or the drive-through window, help the restaurant staff manage their tables and tickets, and answer customer questions about the menu."", ""Toast is a disruptor at heart. Its point-of-sales hardware is sold at a loss in order to inspire stronger sales and unbreakable customer loyalty. Adding some AI brains to the system is a natural move and it sets this company apart from larger and wealthier rivals like Block (NYSE: SQ). The stock might be down now, but its innovative platform suggests it's a long-term play waiting to be recognized."", 'That makes Toast another great growth stock to buy now and hold forever.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Toast right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Toast, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Toast wasn't one of them.

The performance of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF makes that clear. Leading drugmaker Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) has had a better showing, but it has still substantially trailed the S&P 500."", ""Still, long-term investors will want to know whether the drugmaker can deliver solid results over the long run -- and one year's worth of underperformance doesn't tell us much either way. For that, let's look into what's going on with Amgen and decide whether buying the biotech's shares today is worth it."", ""Amgen's revenue hasn't been growing at a good clip, for the most part, over the past few years. The company is dealing with increased competition, sometimes generic and sometimes not, for some of its key products. In the third quarter, revenue rose by nearly 4% year over year to $6.9 billion. That's not bad by the standards the drugmaker has set over the past three years."", 'Still, investors will want the biotech to deliver consistent top-line growth. Amgen has tried to remedy the situation by launching new products. One of them was Tezspire, an asthma treatment developed with AstraZeneca. The other was cancer medicine Lumakras, whose claim to fame was to be the first to target a mutation present in about 13% of lung cancer patients.', ""They haven't been on the market for that long, and neither is generating anywhere near enough sales to meaningfully impact Amgen's revenue yet. For instance, Tezspire's revenue in the third quarter was just $161 million, although that was an increase of 192.7% year over year. Amgen also seized on capturing some of the multibillion-dollar market that became available when Humira lost patent exclusivity earlier this year."", ""The company's generic version of the immunology medicine, Amjevita, generated $152 million in sales in Q3, up 30% year over year. Amgen's biggest growth drivers for the quarter included osteoporosis medicine Prolia, whose revenue of $986 million jumped 14% versus the prior-year period. The biotech also recently completed the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics for about $28 billion in cash."", ""The key asset from the transaction was Tepezza, the first and only medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat thyroid eye disease. Tepezza was first given the green light in early 2020, and the pandemic disrupted its initial launch because most ophthalmologists' offices initially closed. Horizon Therapeutics did find a way to reach out directly to patients."", ""However, the backing of Amgen -- whose funds, sales team, and relationships in the healthcare industry are likely far greater than Horizon's -- should help improve things."", 'Further, Amgen can look to its pipeline, too. The company is developing several biosimilar products. It is betting on this market because most patients in the U.S. think prescription drug prices are too high, so there is a substantial need for cheaper options. Amgen is also developing brand-new products of its own, in addition to the many label expansions it should receive for its existing therapies.', ""While the past three years have been volatile on the top line for Amgen, this was a highly unusual period for any business given the pandemic. In my view, the company's revenue should stabilize within a couple of years and start moving in the right direction consistently again."", ""Amgen stock should appeal to income-seeking investors. The company's dividend yield of 3.14% is nearly twice the S&P 500's 1.62%. The biotech has raised its dividend by almost 47% in the past five years alone, while its cash payout ratio of 47.5% still looks reasonable. Of course, this won't matter much if Amgen's business encounters enough issues down the line to force the company to slash its payouts, but that seems unlikely."", ""Even amid the pandemic and the associated economic troubles -- both marketwide and company-specific ones -- the drugmaker has continued to reward shareholders with dividend hikes. That speaks volumes about the strength of Amgen's underlying business. As things improve for the company, which they will as older products begin to have less of an impact on its financial results, Amgen's dividend program should remain one of its brightest spots."", ""While the biotech doesn't offer an exciting business like those that focus on artificial intelligence, nor will it be a high-growth stock, Amgen is an excellent pick for risk-averse dividend investors focused on the long game."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amgen right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amgen, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amgen wasn't one of them.

To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Analysts.', 'Gold has started to make noise in the stock and commodity markets again as it recently jumped to a record high. One of the main reasons behind this surge is the belief that the yellow metal is a hedge against inflation, and investors want to safeguard their money in an uncertain economic environment. Furthermore, central banks are also aggressively buying gold. The central banks added 30% of the world’s mining production to their reserves in 2023. The SVB crash and Middle-East conflict have been a growth catalyst for the precious metal in the year. Gold stocks have also reaped the rewards of rising gold prices and central bank activity. At its latest earnings call presentation, Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU)’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Tomory, said:', '“Centerra had a very strong third quarter with significant free cash flow generation, driving a substantial increase to our cash balance outperformed our expectations, producing almost 87,000 ounces in the quarter. Our 2023 consolidated gold production guidance remains on track between 340,000 and 360,000 ounces, and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter further increasing our cash balance by the end of the year.”', 'Gold has shown resilience during a high-interest rate environment, expectations that the Fed might start cutting interest rates in 2024 could be favorable for the commodity in the coming year. Lower interest rates could make cash and cash equivalents less enticing compared to gold.', 'The third quarter also saw the largest takeover in gold mining in 2023. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited on November 6. The company acquired Newcrest for A$26.2 billion, adding five active mines and two advanced projects to the world’s largest gold mining company’s portfolio.', 'Some experts believe that while gold is a hedge against inflation, the statement is partially true. Gold is volatile commodity. Historically, gold has been seen to be more volatile than stocks and bonds. In a recent video, billionaire Ken Fisher explains that since the gold standard ended, gold has had lower long-term returns compared to stocks and bonds, yet it has been significantly more volatile than both. Stocks have been shown to return almost twice as much as gold with 20% lesser volatility.', 'Fisher further explains that gold has a very long period of losing money and then gives a short window where the prices rise remarkably. In conclusion, the billionaire believes that investors have to time their investments in gold perfectly to achieve maximum results and timing gold is trickier than timing stocks and bonds.', 'When it comes to gold stocks, Fisher believes that, more often than not gold, they fall into a subcategory that moves with the smaller value stocks.', 'Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) has gained 10.23% as of December 15.

Fundamentally, while the unexpectedly strong jobs report for November tempered hopes that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts earlier, the economy still presents an ambiguous backdrop.', 'For one thing, a recent Reuters report suggests that the central bank could start cutting rates around May next year. That seems an aggressive goal considering that inflation remains stubbornly elevated from pre-pandemic norms. Nevertheless, it the Fed decides to cut rates, inflation could once again skyrocket, sending the best gold stocks higher.', 'Now, if that scenario doesn’t materialize, safe havens may still have their place in the sun. One subtle indicator that not all is well stems from the sales of Swiss luxury watches. With more affluent consumers deciding to cut back on their discretionary purchases, that may be a sign that the fear trade could eventually take centerstage.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'If so, you’ll be glad to have these top gold stocks.', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'An American gold mining firm, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is the world’s largest corporation of its kind. Per its public profile, it owns precious metal mines domestically and throughout the globe, including countries such as Argentina, Ghana, and Australia. While traditionally one of the safe havens in terms of mining enterprises, it lost a significant amount of value since the start of the year.', 'Admittedly, that’s a distracting narrative. However, in the trailing month, NEM gained over 15% of equity value, demonstrating renewed interest in gold stocks. For Newmont, the company will likely march forward on its solid trailing-year operating margin of 9.93%. That’s noticeably above the sector median value of 1.89%.', 'And while Newmont suffered a big hit in the bottom line last year, it still offers a forward dividend yield of 4.09%. That’s above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. In addition, NEM carries a moderate buy view among analysts with a $48.67 average price target, implying almost 25% upside.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'An established player among top gold stocks, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) offers a solid example of publicly traded safe havens. According to its public profile, Barrick produces gold and copper with 16 operating sites in 13 countries. As with Newmont above, the company features a diverse mining portfolio, with projects located in Canada, Zambia and Saudi Arabia.', 'To be sure, one blemish focuses on its market performance. Since the start of the year, GOLD stock slipped about 6%. However, in the past 30 days, the equity unit swung up about 10%, aligning with broader rejuvenated sentiment in the gold ecosystem. Financially, one of Barrick’s main attributes is its trailing-year operating margin. At 23.42%, it stands well above the sector median of 1.89%.', 'Regarding passive income, Barrick carries a forward yield of 2.38%. While it’s not the most generous yield, the payout ratio sits at 36.59%, thus reflecting a sustainable profile. Combined with a moderate buy assessment calling for a price target of $20.73 (up over 23%), GOLD ranks among the best gold stocks.', 'Source: Alexander Limbach / Shutterstock', 'Based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) is a gold-focused royalty and streaming company with a diversified portfolio of cash-flow producing assets. Royalty companies don’t mine commodities. Instead, they offer mining enterprises upfront cash in exchange for a pre-determined cut of the revenue. In that way, FNV ranks among safe havens because of higher business predictability in an often-volatile industry.', 'Nevertheless, pre-determined contractual agreements don’t always guarantee a smooth ride in the price charts. Since the January opener, FNV slipped more than 21%. Further, in the trailing one-month period, shares lost almost 10% of equity value. Therefore, it’s a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Still, it deserves consideration for its reliable financial print.', 'Since 2018, Franco-Nevada has enjoyed consecutive annual revenue increases. Also, despite bumps and bruises, it’s consistently profitable. Now, it must be stated that the company’s forward yield of 1.25% isn’t anything to write home about. But combined with the moderate buy view and average price target of $149.27 (implying almost 38% upside), FNV ranks among the top gold stocks.', 'Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock', 'Another Canadian multinational enterprise, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) is one of the more popular publicly traded safe havens. Primarily, the company specializes in the metals streaming business model. It’s similar to royalty firms. However, rather than taking a cut of revenue, streaming firms receive a portion of metals produced. Given the recent rise in gold prices, that might be the better deal.', 'Interestingly, investors agree wholeheartedly. Since the beginning of the year, WPM gained almost 17% of equity value. That’s a whole lot better than many other so-called best gold stocks. Better yet, the enthusiasm for WPM shares is justified based on the financials. Specifically, Wheaton enjoys strong margins across the board, beating out most competitors.', 'Moreover, the company enjoys a robust balance sheet, particularly its ultra-high cash-to-debt ratio. It also prints a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 34.2%, above nearly 80% of its rivals. In fairness, the company’s 1.27% forward yield is very modest. However, it also carries a strong buy view with a $52.71 price target, projecting over 11% growth.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving over to the middle-to-smaller capitalization ideas for precious metal safe havens, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) owns and operates gold mines in Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines. As a fair warning, it’s a bit riskier than other top gold stocks. Since the start of the year, BTG gave up more than 15% of equity value. Still, it’s also possible that it could be a de-risked opportunity.', 'For one thing, shares gained more than 2% in the trailing month. No, it’s not a performance stat to bank your life savings on. However, it does seem to suggest that the worst of the volatility could be behind us. On a financial level, B2Gold – despite its smaller profile – enjoys stability in the balance sheet. For example, its Altman Z-Score pings at 4.22, right in the safe zone.', 'Further, B2Gold enjoys strong operating and net margins that clock in at 36.15% and 13.96%, respectively. Even with these encouraging metrics, the market prices BTG at a discounted earnings multiple of 9.54x (without non-recurring items).', 'Also, BTG carries a strong buy consensus view with a $5.17 target, implying over 66% upside potential.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Offering an intriguing mix of stability and upside prospects, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) is a Canadian-based gold producer with operations in Finland, Australia, Mexico and its home nation. It also features exploration and development activities that extend to the U.S. To be sure, AEM slipped this year but modestly so, down a bit more than 4%.', 'Despite the crimson ink, Agnico may be one of the best gold stocks for balance. During the trailing one-month period, AEM spiked up more than 8%. This dynamic loosely suggests that the miner could be on a comeback trail. Financially, Agnico makes a very solid case with its profit margins. In particular, its net margin clocks in at a whopping 40.53%, above over 94% of its rivals.', 'Just as well, the company offers a forward yield of 3.12%. That’s better than the materials sector average of 2.82%, although the payout ratio is a bit elevated at 68%. Lastly, Agnico enjoys a unanimous strong buy assessment with a $60.58 target, projecting over 18% growth potential.', 'Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com', 'If you want to dial up the risk-reward profile of your publicly traded gold safe havens, you may want to give Victoria Gold (OTCMKTS:VITFF) a try. As a disclaimer, Victoria represents a speculative entity. For one thing, it’s on the smaller end of the small-cap spectrum. In addition, VITFF – as you can tell from its funky ticker symbol – isn’t traded in an exchange.', 'Rather, VITFF trades hands over the counter (across broker-dealer networks). Administratively, the risks to speculating on Victoria shares include wide bid-ask spreads and thin average volume. On the positive side, VITFF could be a hidden gem among speculative safe havens. For example, the company started generating revenue in 2020 and in 2022 posted sales of $236.9 million. On a trailing-12-month basis, revenue is at $305.6 million.', 'Also, the company enjoys a strong operating margin and a decent net margin. Even better, VITFF trades at 8.27x forward earnings, below the sector median value of 10.92x.

To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Analysts.', 'Gold has started to make noise in the stock and commodity markets again as it recently jumped to a record high. One of the main reasons behind this surge is the belief that the yellow metal is a hedge against inflation, and investors want to safeguard their money in an uncertain economic environment. Furthermore, central banks are also aggressively buying gold. The central banks added 30% of the world’s mining production to their reserves in 2023. The SVB crash and Middle-East conflict have been a growth catalyst for the precious metal in the year. Gold stocks have also reaped the rewards of rising gold prices and central bank activity. At its latest earnings call presentation, Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU)’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Tomory, said:', '“Centerra had a very strong third quarter with significant free cash flow generation, driving a substantial increase to our cash balance outperformed our expectations, producing almost 87,000 ounces in the quarter. Our 2023 consolidated gold production guidance remains on track between 340,000 and 360,000 ounces, and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter further increasing our cash balance by the end of the year.”', 'Gold has shown resilience during a high-interest rate environment, expectations that the Fed might start cutting interest rates in 2024 could be favorable for the commodity in the coming year. Lower interest rates could make cash and cash equivalents less enticing compared to gold.', 'The third quarter also saw the largest takeover in gold mining in 2023. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited on November 6. The company acquired Newcrest for A$26.2 billion, adding five active mines and two advanced projects to the world’s largest gold mining company’s portfolio.', 'Some experts believe that while gold is a hedge against inflation, the statement is partially true. Gold is volatile commodity. Historically, gold has been seen to be more volatile than stocks and bonds. In a recent video, billionaire Ken Fisher explains that since the gold standard ended, gold has had lower long-term returns compared to stocks and bonds, yet it has been significantly more volatile than both. Stocks have been shown to return almost twice as much as gold with 20% lesser volatility.', 'Fisher further explains that gold has a very long period of losing money and then gives a short window where the prices rise remarkably. In conclusion, the billionaire believes that investors have to time their investments in gold perfectly to achieve maximum results and timing gold is trickier than timing stocks and bonds.', 'When it comes to gold stocks, Fisher believes that, more often than not gold, they fall into a subcategory that moves with the smaller value stocks.', 'Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) has gained 10.23% as of December 15.

However, there might not be a trade-off between higher dividends and increased profit growth, as reported by Newton Investment Management. In fact, giving dividends could encourage companies to manage their funds more wisely. In their paper titled Surprise! Higher Dividends = Higher Earnings Growth, Robert D. Arnott and Clifford S. Asness found a positive relationship between how much a company pays in dividends and its future earnings growth in the US market over seven decades until 2001. This suggests that paying dividends promotes better control over capital, potentially leading to stronger long-term returns. Additionally, companies that generate high returns on invested capital (ROIC) and carefully reinvest their capital are more likely to sustain a healthy and growing dividend. The report highlighted research by Conover et al. (2016), which conducted an extensive empirical study spanning more than five decades, from 1962 to 2014, using US market data. Their research revealed that investing in stocks that pay dividends not only boosts returns but also notably diminishes the risk associated with both value and growth portfolios. This outcome held true across various market capitalizations, indicating that the benefits of investing in dividend-paying stocks extend beyond specific sectors or company sizes."", ""When examining the broader scope of dividend stocks without isolating their performance to specific periods, it becomes evident that dividends consistently play a significant role in contributing to the overall market returns. Dividends have played a significant role in stock market returns, contributing to 40% of the total returns since 1930 and rising to 54% during periods of high inflation. Particularly during these inflationary times, stocks that consistently raised their dividends outpaced the overall market performance. Moreover, dividend payments can serve as a stabilizing force, potentially reducing the overall volatility in a stock's total return. This stability often appeals to investors looking for steadier income streams and less fluctuation in their investment portfolios."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Analysts.', 'Gold has started to make noise in the stock and commodity markets again as it recently jumped to a record high. One of the main reasons behind this surge is the belief that the yellow metal is a hedge against inflation, and investors want to safeguard their money in an uncertain economic environment. Furthermore, central banks are also aggressively buying gold. The central banks added 30% of the world’s mining production to their reserves in 2023. The SVB crash and Middle-East conflict have been a growth catalyst for the precious metal in the year. Gold stocks have also reaped the rewards of rising gold prices and central bank activity. At its latest earnings call presentation, Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU)’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Tomory, said:', '“Centerra had a very strong third quarter with significant free cash flow generation, driving a substantial increase to our cash balance outperformed our expectations, producing almost 87,000 ounces in the quarter. Our 2023 consolidated gold production guidance remains on track between 340,000 and 360,000 ounces, and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter further increasing our cash balance by the end of the year.”', 'Gold has shown resilience during a high-interest rate environment, expectations that the Fed might start cutting interest rates in 2024 could be favorable for the commodity in the coming year. Lower interest rates could make cash and cash equivalents less enticing compared to gold.', 'The third quarter also saw the largest takeover in gold mining in 2023. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited on November 6. The company acquired Newcrest for A$26.2 billion, adding five active mines and two advanced projects to the world’s largest gold mining company’s portfolio.', 'Some experts believe that while gold is a hedge against inflation, the statement is partially true. Gold is volatile commodity. Historically, gold has been seen to be more volatile than stocks and bonds. In a recent video, billionaire Ken Fisher explains that since the gold standard ended, gold has had lower long-term returns compared to stocks and bonds, yet it has been significantly more volatile than both. Stocks have been shown to return almost twice as much as gold with 20% lesser volatility.', 'Fisher further explains that gold has a very long period of losing money and then gives a short window where the prices rise remarkably. In conclusion, the billionaire believes that investors have to time their investments in gold perfectly to achieve maximum results and timing gold is trickier than timing stocks and bonds.', 'When it comes to gold stocks, Fisher believes that, more often than not gold, they fall into a subcategory that moves with the smaller value stocks.', 'Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) has gained 10.23% as of December 15.

Western central banks are increasing interest rates which means that they will have to pay more interest on the record levels of debt that their government’s owe. Where will the money come from to pay the higher interest expense? The answer is simple – more debt and more money printing! We believe the gold knows this!

If you want to skip our overview of the real estate sector and the latest news, then take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. ', ""In today's high interest rate environment, the real estate sector has been one of the most dynamic industries. Like banking, real estate is also quite sensitive to high rates as they impact the demand for properties and also make financing new and existing projects costlier. This has been evident in the commercial and office real estate industry, as the growth in work from home trends combined with high rates has shaken up the environment in which these companies operate."", ""To understand the scope of the downturn in the office real estate industry, consider the American Institute of Architects (AIA)'s AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index. Like production indexes that measure the size of activity in industries, this index measures the business that architecture firms receive. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the sector, and during October, the ABI stood at 44.3 to mark a nearly three year low reading that eclipsed the downturn in the segment in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic's disruptions were at their peak. More worryingly, the architecture firms also reported that not only did the value of new contracts drop for the third consecutive month, but inquiries for new projects dropped for the first time since July 2020."", 'Building on this, the chief executive officer of the asset manager TCW Group - who is a major bondholder in the real estate market - believes that the commercial real estate market is due for a serious shakeup. Speaking to CNBC, Katie Koch shared in October 2023 that as much as one third of existing office space will be removed from the market in order to readjust it to the current status quo. According to her, this resizing will be focused primarily on non top tier office properties, a view that was also presented by the Washington, D.C. based real estate market data and intelligence provider CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP).', ""CoStar's analysis believes that even though commercial real estate is undergoing seismic level shifts, ironically, these changes will also increase the demand for top tier, Grade A office properties. This is because as the office real estate market shrinks, the demand for existing products will increase. When combined with a return to normalcy for working trends, big ticket firms will be eager to get their hands on lucrative properties and consequently drive up their demand."", ""Shifting gears, another real estate sector that's been in the news a lot in 2023 is the residential sector. Residential real estate companies faced a roaring market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as low rates and growing work from home trends incentivized workers to buy homes in suburban and other localities. This helped them beef up their margins and offer low mortgage rates later on even after the Federal Reserve's multiple 75 basis point interest rate hikes. In fact, the hype surrounding the residential real estate sector reached a feverish pitch in August when the Q2 2023 hedge fund filings started to roll in. They showed that none other than Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway piled into the real estate sector. During Q2, the Oracle of Omaha pumped $814 million into three home building companies.

Over these time -- over time, these steps will hopefully bring inflation to desired levels. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in a more orderly fashion. And while the Fed is working to reduce overall capital levels, the elimination of sharp turns and aggressive moves is generally constructive to consumers finding access to enough capital for their necessities, and housing is a necessity.', 'Against that backdrop, the current housing market is generally defined by a very short supply of affordable products and strong demand for affordable products. The consumers have now adjusted to and accepted ""higher for longer"" interest rates and are willing to purchase or rent what they can afford. The consumer is employed and is confident they will remain employed and likely with a higher wage. Higher rates, with need driving demand and housing in short supply, is the new normal, and the consumer understands that the cost of housing will likely continue to be higher. Generally speaking, strong demand for housing has returned within the limits of affordability. The market has attracted consumers by adjusting prices, increasing incentives, including rate buy-downs, and driving down production costs in order to enable consumers to afford needed shelter, and customers have responded.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most profitable real estate stocks.

More than half of patients with gastric cancer have tumors expressing PD-L1 (CPS ≥1), and the majority of gastric cancers are HER2-negative, affecting approximately four out of every five patients. Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 patient deaths from the disease globally in 2020.

For example, to meet demand for missile defenses, production of Patriot interceptors for the U.S. Army - a projectile fired at an incoming missile with the aim of knocking it down - will rise from 550 to 650 rockets per year. At around $4 million each, that's a potential $400 million annual sales boost on one weapons system alone."", 'Since increasing production volumes of older systems is always more profitable than the high investment costs associated with ramping up production of new systems, stronger demand will flow quickly to the corporate bottom line.', 'Shares of the biggest defense companies, which have handily beat the benchmark S&P 500 stock index for the last two years, are expected to keep rising, according to Wall Street estimates.', 'Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman shares are forecast to rise between 5% and 7% over the next 12 months, while the S&P is seen making limited gains.', 'US weapons stockpiles were not ""full"" before Russia invaded Ukraine, said Eric Fanning, chief executive of the U.S. Aerospace Industries Association, and ""adversaries are seeing our stockpiles starting thin and being depleted."" As a result, demand is being driven by Chinese aggression, fear about Russian aggression and to support allies in the Middle East, he said.', 'PATRIOTS AND ROCKET MOTORS', 'Patriot systems production can be broken down to show how sales of basic items will impact a range of companies. To start, RTX manufactures the radars and ground systems, and Lockheed Martin manufactures the latest generation interceptor missiles.', 'RTX boosted launcher and control system production to 12 units a year. A launcher and radar together cost around $400 million each.', 'Boeing has said over the next few years it will increase its Huntsville, Alabama, factory production capacity for sensors that are used to guide Patriot missiles by more than 30%.', ""Another strong demand signal can be seen in the backlog of solid rocket motors which are used by the vast array of arms in high demand since Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."", 'The U.S. has two main rocket motor makers, Northrop Grumman, and L3Harris Technologies, which both said they have seen demand increase.', 'Northrop said much of the increase is due to demand for its rocket motors and warheads in the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) which are heavily used in Ukraine.', 'GMLRS are GPS-guided rockets with 200-pound (90kg) warheads. Lockheed Martin makes 10,000 of the missiles per year and is increasing production to 14,000. They have an average cost of $148,000 each according to Army documents and more than 6,100 have been sent to Ukraine so far, according to a Reuters analysis.', '""Each day the munitions are being fired reinforces the need for substantive stockpiles,"" Tim Cahill, who runs Lockheed\'s Missiles and Fire Control business - a prime contractor for Patriot interceptors and GMLRS - said in a Reuters interview. ""And I don\'t see that going down.""', 'An executive at a rocket motor maker said the administration of President Joe Biden prioritized munitions in its 2024 Pentagon budget request.', 'He expected a boost to order backlogs once contracts came through following the passage of the $886 billion defense policy bill known as the NDAA, or National Defense Authorization Act. It was approved by Congress last week and Biden is expected to sign it into law.', '(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington; editing by Chris Sanders and Grant McCool)']"

DOCU, Nike, Inc. NKE, Target TGT and Walmart WMT.', 'Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores the bullish market rally following the Fed’s rate cut outlook. Despite the impressive run for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in 2023, many large-cap stocks have underperformed for various reasons. The three highly-ranked stocks we dig into today are all trading at least 30% below their highs and could be poised for serious comebacks in 2024.', 'Jay Powell and the Fed gave the green light to the bulls on Wednesday when the world’s most important central bank signaled the possibility of three rate cuts in 2024. The 10-year U.S. Treasury is back below 4% (3.92%) after sitting at 5% in late October as Wall Street rapidly prices in lower rates.', 'The Fed’s newfound dovishness finally confirms what the bulls have been saying and doing for a large chunk of 2023 and certainly since the end of October. The S&P 500 appears on the cusp of summiting a new peak by the end of 2023 or early 2024.', 'All of this strength came before we even entered the official Santa Claus rally period, which includes the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year.', 'There will likely be some selling and choppiness in the weeks and months ahead. Still, more money is poised to flow into stocks in 2024 as the calculus on cash and bonds changes and investors grow increasingly nervous about missing out again.', 'DocuSign, Inc.', 'DocuSign crushed our Q3 FY24 EPS estimate on December 7 and raised its guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. DOCU stock has soared 30% in the last month to retake its 50-day, its 200-day, and its long-term 50-week moving averages. Yet, the e-signature stock still trades over 80% below its record highs after it got crushed for slowing growth and weak bottom-line results.', 'DOCU’s revenue soared following its 2018 IPO, including four straight years of between 35% to 49% growth (19% last year in FY23). The company remains a powerhouse of electronic signatures, document generation, and beyond as medical forms, legal documents, and much more are becoming increasingly paperless. DocuSign has responded to its slower growth and higher rate environment by cutting costs, changing leadership, and rolling out other efforts to streamline its business.', 'DocuSign’s valuation levels remain sky-high. But DOCU is focused on the bottom line. Investors might want to consider the e-signature and digital document firm with 1.4 million customers as Wall Street begins to search high and low for technology stocks that are still trading far below their highs.', 'Nike, Inc.', 'Nike trades around 30% below its highs heading into its Q2 FY24 earnings release on December 21. Wall Street sold Nike shares based on fears about growing competition and other headwinds. NKE also got caught up in the broader consumer discretionary selloff. Nike certainly faces increased competition from relative newcomers Hoka and On in the running shoe segment and among consumers looking for maximum comfort and support at their jobs. Adidas, Lululemon, and digital native upstarts are also fighting for a larger share of the so-called streetwear market or the fashion end of sportswear.', 'Despite more challengers, Nike remains the heavyweight champion of sportswear and one of the most valuable brands in the world alongside the likes of Coca-Cola. NKE has treaded down a new direct-to-consumer-heavy path in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. Nike’s sales are projected to climb 4% this year and over 8% higher next year to help boost its adjusted earnings by 16% and 17%, respectively, based on Zacks estimates.', 'Nike’s earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now and its Shoes and Retail Apparel segment is in the top 23% of over 250 Zacks industries. Nike has climbed 850% during the last 15 years vs. the S&P 500’s 420% and its sector’s 220%. Nike is up 73% in the past five years, even though it trades 30% below its highs. Nike has retaken its 50-day and 200-day and is on the cusp of climbing above its very long-term 50-month moving average. Nike trades near its 10-year median at 29.7X forward 12-month earnings and pays a dividend.', 'Target', 'Target posted blowout Q3 earnings results in mid-November and provided upbeat guidance that helped it capture a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The strong bottom-line performance extended its recent rebound that has TGT stock up 30% since the start of the fourth quarter. Even with the comeback, the retail standout trades 45% below its highs.', 'TGT’s resurgence has taken it right to its 50-week moving average and solidly above its 200-day and 50-day. Target trades at a 30% discount to its sector, 32% below Walmart, and close to TGT’s 10-year median. TGT stock is far more than a plummeting pandemic winner. Target crushed Walmart over the last 15 years, up 310% vs. 170% despite its massive fall from its 2021 highs.', 'Target, like many others, failed to adapt to quickly changing consumer shopping patterns over the last year-plus. The firm is also dealing with other setbacks. But it appears that TGT is finally finding its footing again. TGT’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar 39% this year and then climb another 9% higher next year. And its dividend yields 3.2% right now.', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

This takes the dividend yield to 6.2%, which shareholders will be pleased with."", ' View our latest analysis for Pfizer ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. At the time of the last dividend payment, Pfizer was paying out a very large proportion of what it was earning and 113% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 29.1% over the next year. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 73% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.96 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.5% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios."", 'Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Earnings per share has been sinking by 14% over the last five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.', ""Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Pfizer is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

The stock has lost 28% of its value in the last five years, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has more than doubled."", 'But can this fintech stock double in the next five years? This would translate to a 15% annualized return.', ""It's not totally out of the question. Here's what it would take."", ""PayPal has been benefiting from the rise of digital payments from the time it was part of eBay to today. The popularity of online shopping, coupled with the digitization and globalization of commerce, has also propelled PayPal. There's no reason to believe this trend won't keep boosting the business."", 'One important metric that needs to grow for the stock to double in the next five years is total payment volume (TPV). This measures the dollar amount of activity PayPal handles in a given period. From $451 billion in 2017 to an annualized pace of nearly $1.6 trillion\xa0in the most recent quarter (Q3 2023 ended Sept. 30), the business has clearly been gaining greater adoption.', 'But why does PayPal deserve to keep succeeding?', 'For starters, its digital wallet is the most widely accepted in North America and Europe, with nearly 80%\xa0market share among the top 1,500 merchants in these two continents. This wide acceptance puts PayPal in a prime position.', ""Because of the company's more than two-decade track record of successfully handling payments safely and securely, PayPal is a trusted industry name that doesn't go unnoticed. Both enterprises and consumers realize this."", ""Plus, by operating a two-sided ecosystem that can collect data from both individuals and merchants, PayPal is better able to detect fraud while increasing authorization rates than rivals that only deal with one side of a transaction.\xa0Of course, TPV growth must translate into revenue gains also. According to Wall Street estimates, PayPal's sales are forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 8.4% between 2022 and 2025, which would be a healthy rate."", ""Besides rising revenue and greater usage of PayPal's payments platform, this business might need to demonstrate that it has operating leverage. This won't be an easy task, mainly because PayPal has failed to do this in the past."", ""For example, the company's transaction margin has actually shrunk from 65.1% in Q4 2017 to 45.4% in the most recent quarter. A key reason for this is that PayPal's transaction take rate, or the amount of money it makes from each transaction it processes, has fallen over time."", 'As the payments landscape becomes increasingly competitive, the take rate will likely continue to drop due to pricing pressure. And a valid argument can be made that payments is a commoditized service.', ""Let's turn our attention to the operating margin. In PayPal's defense, this metric has stayed relatively constant over the years, successfully holding up despite the declining take rate."", 'However, it can be discouraging because payments networks should benefit from a widening margin. The technological and communications infrastructure is already built out, so every additional transaction should produce a high margin.', 'Nonetheless, PayPal produces a lot of free cash flow that management uses to aggressively buy back the stock. This helps provide a bump to earnings per share.', ""The last piece of the puzzle for PayPal's stock to double is more love from the investment community. Since the stock has been crushed in the past 2 1/2 years, it trades at a cheap valuation, a price-to-earnings (P/E)\xa0multiple of just 18.5. That's cheaper\xa0than the broader S&P 500. "", ""I have no clue what PayPal's P/E ratio should be in five years, but if revenue and earnings growth remain strong, a higher valuation can provide a major tailwind for the stock price.

PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) and SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ: SEDG) look particularly compelling at their current valuations, and both stocks are widely accessible at less than $100 per share.', ""Here's what investors should know about these two growth stocks."", 'Fintech company PayPal grew at a steady pace in the third quarter. Revenue increased 8% year over year to $7.4 billion and non-GAAP net income climbed 14% to $1.4 billion as the company continued to focus on cost control.

Those assets form the crux of the investment thesis for PayPal.', 'Specifically, most payment service providers work exclusively with merchants, but PayPal offers financial services to merchants and consumers, meaning it has a deeper understanding of consumer habits. It uses that data to surface shopper insights, improve authorization rates, and prevent fraud for merchants. CFO Gabrielle Rabinovitch says PayPal has the lowest loss rates and best authorization rates in the industry', 'The upshot of those advantages is that PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet in North America and Europe, and the leader in online payment processing with a 41% market share, according to Statista. In that context, PayPal should grow in lockstep (at a minimum) with retail e-commerce sales, a market forecasted to increase at 7.6% annually through 2030.', ""Benchmarking PayPal to the broader online retail industry leaves room for upside if the company gains traction in physical retail, something it aims to do with the Venmo credit and debit cards. But even if PayPal merely matches the 7.6% annual growth in retail e-commerce, its current valuation of 2.3 times sales looks cheap, especially when the five-year average is 7.6 times sales. That's why this growth stock is a no-brainer buy."", 'SolarEdge had a dismal third quarter as demand for solar energy products nosedived due to high interest rates. Revenue dropped 13% year over year to $725 million and the company reported a GAAP loss of $61 million, down from a profit of $25 million in the prior year.', 'Management expects similar results while distributors work through inventory backlog in the coming quarters. However, weak near-term guidance does not change the long-term investment thesis. Renewable energy is inevitable, and SolarEdge is well-positioned to benefit as the solar industry expands in the years ahead.', 'SolarEdge primarily provides solar inverters, power optimizers, and monitoring software to residential and commercial customers. Inverters change direct current (DC) electricity into usable alternating current (AC) electricity, and power optimizers maximize the energy production per panel by mitigating problems related to partial shading and manufacturing intolerance.', 'The SolarEdge brand carries weight with its customers (distributors and installers). The company revolutionized the solar industry when it brought the first power optimizer to market about two decades ago, and it has since evolved into the second-largest manufacturer of solar inverters in the world (and the largest outside of China).', 'Beyond those markets, SolarEdge has branched into the adjacent areas of energy storage (batteries), electric vehicle (EV) chargers, and energy management software. For instance, the company introduced a new storage system and EV management software for commercial customers earlier this year. Those solutions integrate with existing products to extend the functionality of the SolarEdge platform, broadening its addressable market.', 'On that note, the solar inverter market is forecasted to increase at 4.5% annually through 2031, and the solar battery market is projected to increase at 15.5% annually through 2030, according to Straits Research. Meanwhile, the power optimizer market is forecasted to grow at 13.4% annually, according to Precedence Research.', 'SolarEdge will probably land somewhere in the middle, meaning the company has a great shot at high-single-digit or even low-double-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade. Indeed, Morningstar analysts expect revenue to grow at 10% annually over the next five years, and Morgan Stanley analysts expect revenue to grow at 9% annually over the next decade.', ""In that context, its current valuation of 1.6 times sales looks cheap, especially when the five-year average is 5.8 times sales.

These add-on businesses range from artificial intelligence to cloud management cybersecurity to automation, to name a few."", 'The thing is, offering such turn-key cloud computing solutions means IBM can generate a combination of software, hardware, and consulting revenue from any given client.', '""Our approach to hybrid cloud is platform-centric,"" CFO Jim Kavanaugh explained during the Q4 2022 earnings call in January. ""As we land a platform, we get a multiplier effect across software, consulting, and infrastructure."" He didn\'t divulge specific numbers at the time, but Kavanaugh has commented in the past that ""for every dollar that we land on [sales of] the [hybrid cloud] platform, we get $3 to $5 of software and $6 to $8 of services revenue.""', ""It seems we're finally seeing the measurable benefit of this dynamic. Last quarter's software revenue was up 8% year over year, while consulting revenue improved 6% on much more modest infrastructure sales growth of only 2%. And this is largely recurring revenue that helps support a dividend. IBM not only maintained its payouts during the rough patch it was going through a few years ago, but it has raised them for 28 consecutive years."", 'At current prices, new investors would be buying the stock with a dividend yield of a little more than 4%.', ""Last but not least, add Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) to your list of dividend-paying technology stocks to buy. Currently, it's yielding a respectable 3.1%."", ""Not unlike IBM and HP, Cisco's glory days came in the late 1990s and early 2000s. That's when it was riding the then-rapid growth of the personal computer market. Cisco's role in that movement was supplying the world with the modems, routers, and switches needed to connect PCs to the internet and to one another. It still manufactures this hardware, although demand isn't quite as fevered now as it was then. New entrants into the ethernet switch and router market are also competitive against market-leading Cisco."", ""The networking hardware business has changed, however, in a way that helps keep Cisco surprisingly competitive. See, in step with other kinds of related technologies, switches, and routers are now powered by adaptable and updatable software. The company did $4.4 billion worth of software business during the fiscal quarter that ended Oct. 28 -- roughly one-third of its total sales. Its subscription-based businesses produced a total of $6.5 billion worth of sales for the quarter, accounting for nearly half of the company's top line."", 'This isn\'t a coincidence. It\'s by design. As CEO Chuck Robbins commented during the earnings call, ""We continue to transform our business toward more software and recurring revenue streams fueled by accelerated innovation."" The word ""recurring"" is key here, as it translates into predictable, reliable cash flow that in turn funds continued dividend payments. To that point, Cisco\'s annualized rate of recurring revenue stands at $24.5 billion, which is just under half of last year\'s total top line.', ""You'll probably never get great growth from Cisco stock. You'll certainly get good income, however, from a dividend that management has now raised for 13 consecutive years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cisco Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cisco Systems, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cisco Systems wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize.

The S&P 500 appears on the cusp of summiting a new peak by the end of 2023 or early 2024.', 'All of this strength came before we even entered the official Santa Claus rally period, which includes the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year.', 'There will likely be some selling and choppiness in the weeks and months ahead.

The pace of change in this regard has accelerated since the pandemic as factors like technological disruptions, labor shortages, and activist investors keen to reduce carbon footprints. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) market is an indicator of this change with an 18% growth rate for the coming years.\xa0', 'Automation in the business universe is often confused with industrial automation. In the tech-focused society we live in now, automation has moved beyond the industrial and manufacturing sectors, transforming sectors like retail, finance, and even banking. Industrial automation, however, remains one of the biggest drivers of automation growth. According to a study by market research firm Fortune Business Insights, the industrial automation market will reach close to $400 billion in value by the end of this decade, up from $191 billion in 2021.\xa0', 'One example of the importance of automation to the overall health of the economy is the events of the COVID-19 pandemic. The industrial automation initiatives of big companies like Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Emerson Electric Co.

Cloud-based product digitization, like the one offered by Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), integrating AI with raw materials and the end product - effectively the whole supply chain - are one example of this.', 'The field of robotics, also often confused with automation as a whole, has been taking major strides as well.

We have owned Ambarella since the third quarter of 2017 when earnings declined due to sales shortfalls at large customer GoPro. Our thesis was that emerging artificial intelligence (AI), automotive, industrial, and security markets would soon dwarf the company’s declining consumer market. After significant outperformance in 2021driven by strong demand for AI-enabled computer vision chips in a variety of applications, Ambarella’s stock has been weak since2022 and was again this quarter. Ambarella’s legacy products, mainly image processors for low-end security cameras, are in decline while the company re-focuses its resources on its computer vision chips, which are enabled for AI processing. The company has a core competency in placing very complicated algorithms on individual chips in a very power-efficient way, placing Ambarella in a strong leadership position as AI capabilities shift from centralized data centers to inference at the edge, a fast-growing future market. We also believe that the company’s superior technology makes it a highly attractive acquisition target for many larger technology companies.

One of the main reasons behind this surge is the belief that the yellow metal is a hedge against inflation, and investors want to safeguard their money in an uncertain economic environment. Furthermore, central banks are also aggressively buying gold. The central banks added 30% of the world’s mining production to their reserves in 2023. The SVB crash and Middle-East conflict have been a growth catalyst for the precious metal in the year. Gold stocks have also reaped the rewards of rising gold prices and central bank activity.

Stocks have been shown to return almost twice as much as gold with 20% lesser volatility.', 'Fisher further explains that gold has a very long period of losing money and then gives a short window where the prices rise remarkably.

If you want to skip our overview of the blockchain industry, its different use cases, and the latest news, then you can take a look at the\xa05 Most Promising Blockchain Stocks According to Analysts. ', 'The growth in computing power coupled with the migration of both regular people and corporations to the virtual and digital realm has created industries of its own. For instance, enterprise resource planning (ERP) spearheaded by firms such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has enabled companies to streamline their production processes, supply chain management, inventory management, and other operations. Similarly, services offered by firms like Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) enable small and large businesses to manage their finances and ensure accuracy and security.', 'Another industry that has spawned due to the growth in global computing power is the blockchain industry. A blockchain, for those out of the loop, is a collection of computers linked over a network. These computers act as a repository of records, and each time a record is updated, the change is reflected across all computers. This provides network security, as even if one or several nodes are out of order, the data is not lost. Blockchains are often thought of synonymously with Bitcoin, which is unsurprising. Blockchains surfaced along with Bitcoin, as they are a store of records for the work a miner has done to earn a Bitcoin.', ""With time, non cryptocurrency use cases for blockchains have also started to gain popularity. This lends the industry a sizeable value, especially when it comes to improving business processes to increase economic productivity. For instance, according to data from the consulting firm PwC, blockchains carry the potential to improve economic productivity by a cool $1.76 trillion by 2030. According to PwC's research, there are five key industries that stand to benefit the most from the widespread acceptance and application of blockchains. These are supply chain management, financial services, identity management, contracts and dispute resolution, and customer engagement. Within these, supply chain management alone can yield as much as $962 billion in benefits, to account for more than half of the productivity gains. This is because, within supply chains, there is an important area called track and trace. This involves tracking the product from the source of its raw materials to the consumer's hand and then tracing these steps backward. As a result, a distributed ledger proves to be invaluable as it enables firms to store each stage of their product's journey with little error."", ""Shifting gears to focus on the current trends in the blockchain industry, 2023 is a markedly different environment for the sector. 2022 was a shocking year for both the Bitcoin bulls and the blockchain industry as investors were in no mood for either risky and high growth industries or speculative investment vehicles such as Bitcoin. Now, with the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle expected to end soon, the climate and investor mood is shifting. As an example, consider blockchain-based lending. A subcomponent of the finance industry, blockchain based lending sees debtors store their profile on a blockchain to enable creditors to easily evaluate their applications and hopefully improve them."", 'So, how is this climate shifting? Well, according to data from RWA.xyz, active tokenized credit loans currently sit at $582 million marking a 128% annual growth. The APR for these loans sits at 9.63%, with the data showing that perhaps a high interest rate environment is making borrowers seek alternative sources for loans. Sector wise, consumer and auto loans account for 66% of the total loan pie.', ""The changed market climate in 2023, which has seen Bitcoin gain 147% year to date, has also brought blockchain on the radar of the investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). In an interview with Reuters, the bank's global head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott, shared that the demand for digital financial assets based on the blockchain will significantly rise in the future. While typically these assets are cryptocurrencies, according to McDermott, there is a sizeable demand for other digital assets such as bonds that trade on the blockchain."", 'This talk comes as the tail end of 2023 is seeing significant interest among investors for a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) that enables stock market participants to trade in the cryptocurrency.

The chipmaker's shares soared 1,220% over the past five years as it evolved from a maker of gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) into the gatekeeper of the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market."", ""Nvidia achieved that evolution by developing high-end GPUs for accelerating AI tasks at data centers. Unlike central processing units (CPUs), which process one piece of data at a time, GPUs can process a broad range of data points simultaneously. That's why the top generative AI platforms -- including OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E -- are currently powered by Nvidia's GPUs."", ""The AI market's explosive expansion over the past few years sparked a buying frenzy in Nvidia's data center GPUs. That growth offset the lumpier growth of its gaming GPU business, which accelerated throughout the pandemic but faced a tough slowdown as the PC market cooled off. In its latest quarter, Nvidia generated 80% of its revenue from its data center chips and just 16% of its revenue from its gaming business."", ""Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to soar 118% in fiscal 2024 (which ends in January 2024) and grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026. Those growth rates are stunning, but is it a good long-term play?"", 'As the clear leader in high-end GPUs for data centers, Nvidia is poised to profit from the long-term expansion of the AI market. Precedence Research expects the broader AI market to grow at a CAGR\xa0of 19.1% from 2023 to 2032. Within that market, Fortune Business Insights believes the higher-growth generative AI niche will expand at a CAGR of 47.5% from 2022 to 2030.', 'During Nvidia\'s latest conference call in November, CFO Colette Kress said investments in ""infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning recommender systems, and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand"" for its data center GPUs. Kress also said Nvidia had ""significantly increased"" its supply ""every quarter this year"" and will continue to do so next year"" to ""meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities.""', ""Nvidia also remains far ahead of Advanced Micro Devices in the gaming GPU market. It controlled 87% of the discrete GPU market in the second quarter of 2023, according to JPR, compared to AMD's meager 10% share. Therefore, the development of more graphically intensive games should continue to drive the growth of its gaming business."", ""All these catalysts suggest Nvidia's stock still has plenty of room to run -- and it doesn't look too expensive at 24 times forward earnings and 13 times next year's sales."", ""Nvidia's strengths are easy to see, but it also has three glaring weaknesses. First, the AI market might be due for a breather from its feverish growth over the past few years. That slowdown could result in a supply glut and lower GPU prices."", ""Second, there's no guarantee Nvidia will maintain its early-mover advantage in the data center GPU market over the next decade. OpenAI, its biggest backer Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet's Google have all been developing their own first-party AI accelerators to curb their dependence on Nvidia's chips. Smaller companies like Graphcore have also been trying to develop more cost-efficient AI accelerator chips."", ""Lastly, the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China could curb Nvidia's long-term growth. The U.S. government already blocked Nvidia from selling its top-tier A100 and H100 data center chips to Chinese customers last year, but Nvidia shrewdly offset that by selling more of its lower-end A800 and H800 chips in China instead. However, the U.S. closed that loophole in October, banning those sales as well."", ""Nvidia believes it can mitigate that by diverting its China-bound chips to other markets, but that's only a short-term solution to a longer-term problem. The tighter export restrictions could drive Chinese chipmakers to develop their own homegrown AI chips to replace Nvidia's technology -- and those chips could eventually seep into other overseas markets."", ""Nvidia isn't a bulletproof investment, but I believe its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The AI market could cool off, but it still has plenty of room to grow as companies adopt more AI tools to optimize and accelerate their operations."", ""Nvidia should also generate plenty of cash to develop new chips before any meaningful competitors actually arrive in the data center GPU market, and its scale should prevent those rivals from gaining much ground as the AI market expands. Its future in China remains unclear, but it can continue to grow in other markets that aren't as exposed to the trade tensions between the U.S. and China. It will also likely take Chinese chipmakers a long time to develop comparable AI chips on their own."", ""Therefore, Nvidia's rally might stall out as the AI fever dies down, but it's still a sound investment for long-term investors who can tune out all the near-term noise."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Within the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are anticipated to improve tasks such as fraud detection in transactions, portfolio optimization, and options pricing. In the medical field, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and IBM joined forces in April 2023 to leverage generative artificial intelligence and quantum computing to enhance mRNA technology, the foundational technology behind Moderna's highly successful COVID vaccine."", ""In another vein, the trajectory of the quantum computing industry's growth is partially contingent on the proliferation of Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS). QCaaS is a cloud-based platform enabling users to access and leverage quantum computing resources via the internet. This approach offers individuals and organizations the ability to tap into the capabilities of quantum computers without the need to construct and manage their quantum hardware infrastructure.

He admitted the company has a lot to prove, but he thinks his conviction will be borne out as Palantir begins to monetize its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) product.', 'Most Wall Street analysts are decidedly less bullish. In fact, Palantir currently has more sell recommendations than buy recommendations, and the median 12-month price target of $18 per share implies just 2% upside from its current price.', 'Is this stock worth buying?', 'Palantir helps clients turn chaotic data into smart decisions. Its two primary platforms integrate data and machine learning (ML) models into an ontology (a fancy word for digital information mapped to its physical counterparts). For instance, a product could be linked to the factory that made it, the carrier that shipped it, and the consumer who bought it.', 'The ontology surfaces that data through user-facing analytics tools and AI applications, providing decision-makers with actionable insights that drive better outcomes. Additionally, the platform records those decisions to create a feedback loop that supports AI/ML model optimization, a process known as ModelOps.', 'Several analysts have praised Palantir in the last year. Forrester Research named the company a leader in AI/ML platforms, noting that Palantir has a stronger product than any competitor. Similarly, Dresner Advisory Services recognized its leadership in ModelOps, as well as AI/ML and data science. Those acknowledgments are an important signal to prospective customers.', 'Palantir is leaning into its strength in AI/ML with its recently launched AIP product. AIP integrates with its existing platforms for government and commercial clients to add support for large language models. In doing so, AIP lets users integrate generative AI capabilities into their ontologies to automate various workflows.', 'Palantir has also reoriented its go-to-market strategy around AIP bootcamps, five-day events in which clients learn how to build and deploy AI solutions using real data from their businesses. That is a remarkable acceleration from past pilot programs that lasted anywhere from one to three months, and the shift in go-to-market strategy appears to be paying off.', 'Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Taylor had this to say about bootcamps on the latest earnings call: ""Early indications point to vast improvements in our unit economics from initial contact to customer conversion, all while accelerating new customer negotiations. Bootcamps are also driving contract expansions.""', 'Palantir reported solid results in the third quarter. Commercial revenue increased 23% and government revenue increased 12%, such that total revenue rose 17% to $558 million. That sequential acceleration (from 13% growth) reflects increasing demand for AIP among commercial clients.', 'Government revenue decelerated during the quarter, but management expects a reacceleration in the future as those clients adopt AIP. ""The potential market for AIP and the trajectory of possible AIP growth for our business is massive,"" Taylor said.', 'On the bottom line, Palantir achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability. Net income improved to roughly $72 million, up from a loss of $124 million in the prior year. Cost control efforts and improved go-to-market efficiency were the driving forces behind that profitability.', 'The only concerning metric is customer count. While Palantir increased its customer base 34% during the third quarter, revenue is still quite concentrated because the company has only 453 customers. Investors should monitor that metric in future quarters.', 'To summarize, Palantir is a recognized leader in AI/ML platforms and ModelOps, and AIP could cement its strong presence in those markets. The company has a relatively small number of customers, meaning revenue is highly concentrated, but AIP could draw more customers to Palantir in the future.', 'The big data software market is expected to grow at 12% annually through 2027, while the ML platforms market is projected to increase at 35% annually through 2032. Palantir should land somewhere in the middle. For instance, Morgan Stanley analysts expect the company to grow revenue at 20% annually through 2029.', 'In that context, its current valuation of 19 times sales seems somewhat reasonable, though certainly not cheap. Investors who can tolerate volatility should consider buying a position in this growth stock today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

Led by big tech stocks known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" the S&P 500 is now up 23% for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite gained an incredible 42%. However, not every stock has surged this year. Let\'s take a look at three stocks that look set up for a recovery: Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), and Calavo Growers (NASDAQ: CVGW).', 'A little more than a year ago, Bob Iger came out of retirement to replace Bob Chapek as CEO, the man who took over from Iger in 2020. Disney was in disarray, with its linear TV business stalling and losses piling up at its streaming business to the tune of more than $1 billion a quarter.', ""This year, Iger has been focused on cutting costs and reorganizing the company to put storytelling back at the center of the business and return to growth. It's been a tough year for the entertainment giant, and Iger has admitted more than once that repairing the business has been more difficult than expected."", 'However, Disney now looks ready to turn the corner after another rough year. The company recently reinstituted its dividend after pausing it during the pandemic, and Iger said the company was done fixing itself and ready to get back to building.', 'Indeed, the direct-to-consumer segment improved significantly and is on track to turn a profit by the end of the current fiscal year. Recent price hikes on Disney+ and the addition of the ad tier should help it move in that direction.', 'Additionally, the company aims to launch a streaming version of its flagship ESPN channel as soon as 2025, and its theme parks business remains a cash cow, which the company said it would double capital expenditures on, adding new worlds for fans of titles such as Frozen. The possibility is also there for asset sales that could help fund growth projects and pay down debt.', ""Just weeks ago, Disney stock was at a nine-year low, but the business is much larger than it was nine years ago. If management can show it's on a steady track back toward growth, the stock should be rewarded with a higher multiple."", 'Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) was a market laggard for much of the year, but the stock has soared in recent weeks, and more gains could be in store for 2024. Shares of rival Uber Techologies have taken off this year as the ride-sharing leader has delivered growing profits, solid growth, and gained admission to the S&P 500.', 'Lyft could be poised to follow in the footsteps of its larger rival, as the company has taken solid steps toward profitability based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In fact, it has reported an adjusted profit every quarter this year, and its GAAP loss was just $12.1 million in the third quarter.', ""In addition to aggressive layoffs and cost cuts to drive profitability, the company is also making smart moves that should help it grow the top line. Following in Uber's footsteps, Lyft launched in-app advertising, a smart way to monetize its digital real estate, and it introduced a new service called Women+ Connect, which enables women riders and drivers to request and prioritize matches with other women."", ""Lyft's growth has moderated over the years, but bookings and revenue were up 15% and 10%, respectively, in the third quarter, enough to expand margins. In addition, as a marketplace-based business, it should get more profitable as it scales."", 'Finally, the stock looks modestly valued at a forward P/E of 28 based on adjusted earnings. If its recovery continues, Lyft could soar next year.', ""For much of its history, Calavo Growers (NASDAQ: CVGW), one of the world's largest producers of avocados, was a market-crushing stock. However, in recent years, the stock has pulled back, losing that premium as costs have ballooned and it's struggled with volatile avocado prices."", 'However, two main catalysts are already starting to drive a recovery in the stock. First, avocado prices have bounced off of lows in recent months, though they typically decline in the winter due to the growing season. That price recovery should help reverse a sharp decline in revenue, which fell 24% in the third quarter, ended in July.', ""The other reason to bet on a recovery at Calavo is the return of longtime CEO Lee Cole, who was brought back in to stabilize the business under its previous CEO. He's already having an impact on the business, as margins have improved considerably, with gross profit in the grown segment up 80% to $21.4 million even as revenue fell 30%."", ""If prices remain elevated, Cole's efficiency improvements could drive significant profits for Calavo, which could send the stock soaring in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

GIS is scheduled to come up with second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Dec 20. Let’s take a closer look at the company’s Pet segment, which constituted nearly 12% of its total sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.', 'Although General Mills’ Pet segment has been driving the company’s performance, the unit is likely to have witnessed some hurdles in the quarter to be reported.', 'General Mills, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Mills, Inc. Quote', 'GIS is bearing the brunt of the lower impacts of inflation-justified pricing, along with consumers’ shift toward value products stemming from an uncertain economic landscape. The company’s Pet segment retail sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were somewhat affected by these aspects, including pet parents’ shift toward value products and channels, along with smaller pack sizes.Additionally, GIS is witnessing challenges in the wet food and treats categories, with pet parents spending more time at work or away from home. In the first quarter, segment sales remained flat year over year at $580 million as pricing was countered by soft pound volumes.On its last earnings call, management stated that it expects the difficult category dynamics to persist in the Pet segment throughout fiscal 2024 as it does not see any major change in the economic viewpoint for pet parents in the near term. This remains a concern for the quarter under review.Our model suggests Pet segment revenues will grow 4.5% to $619.6 million in the second quarter and form 11.4% of the company’s total revenues.General Mills’ Pet segment mainly constitutes Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc., which was acquired by GIS in fiscal 2018. Following this acquisition, General Mills became one of the leading players in the pet food arena. Blue Buffalo manufactures and markets wholesome natural pet food items and is contributing to General Mills’ top line. Additionally, GIS acquired Tyson Foods’ pet treats business in July 2021, which added another leaf to the company’s impressive Pet story.', 'General Mills’ commitment to its three priorities as part of its Accelerate strategy is likely to have aided in the quarter under review. These include competing efficiently through brand building and innovation, enhancing the supply chain by boosting Holistic Margin Management cost savings and curtailing costs, undertaking efficient capital allocation, rewarding shareholders and staying committed to reshaping the portfolio via strategic acquisitions and divestitures.Apart from this, General Mills’ input cost inflation has been moderating. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that the biggest factors impacting its performance in fiscal 2024 are likely to be consumers’ economic status, the moderating rate of cost inflation and the rising stability of supply-chain status. However, continued brand investments may have escalated SG&A expenses in the second quarter.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.3 billion, suggesting an increase of 2.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

This downturn came in response to Federal Reserve officials taking steam out of the investor enthusiasm about rate cuts. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index registered a loss of up to 1.1%, representing the most substantial decline since December 5. Notably, shares in Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia led the overall market downturn, reported Bloomberg. Hong Kong, in particular, saw a nearly 1% drop in stock values, contributing significantly to the regional decline. Meanwhile, in the United States, futures edged higher. Despite the attempt at recovery, the market sentiment in Asia remained impacted by the Fed's signaling against anticipations of pronounced interest rate cuts. In the currency markets, the dollar exhibited stability during this period of market uncertainty. Additionally, there was a reversal in the two-year Treasury yields, undoing gains observed on Friday."", ""The reversal came as New York Fed President John Williams and other officials emphasized that it is premature to consider lowering borrowing costs at this juncture. The Fed's stance and its impact on market expectations have created a ripple effect, influencing not only Asian stocks but also prompting adjustments in swap traders' bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024. The dynamic nature of global financial markets underscores the importance of monitoring central bank communications and their implications for investors navigating the ever-changing landscape of international markets. As uncertainties persist, market participants are closely watching for further cues from central banks and assessing the potential repercussions on various asset classes."", ""According to state media citing officials from the Chinese Communist Party's finance and economy office, China's economy is poised for favorable conditions and opportunities in 2024. The annual Central Economic Work Conference, held from December 11-12, outlined macroeconomic policies to support economic recovery. According to Reuters, despite challenges in the domestic economic cycle, officials noted low prices, manageable central government debt, and favorable conditions for implementing monetary and fiscal policies. Next year, China aims to transition from post-pandemic recovery to sustained consumption growth, addressing weak demand, consumption, and enterprise investment. The International Monetary Fund revised China's growth forecast to 5.4% this year, with the government targeting around 5%. The country plans to stimulate new consumption growth in areas such as smart homes, recreation, tourism, and sports events. The effects of this year's treasury bond issuance, interest rate cuts, tax and fee reductions, and other policies will extend into 2024. China will continue monitoring its real estate market, aiming to meet reasonable financing needs and achieve policy objectives for risk prevention and market stabilization. The report emphasizes concerted efforts for success in these policy initiatives."", 'On the stock market front, analysts are bearish on pharmaceutical stocks such as Biogen Inc.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) from $275 to $260 while maintaining a Buy rating for the company's shares. Despite anticipating Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Q4 deliveries to align with Street expectations, the analyst expresses concern about significant downside risk to the 2024 consensus estimates. This apprehension is attributed to limited volume growth projected for the upcoming year. The firm's Q4 deliveries estimate remains at 476,000 units, allowing Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to meet its guidance of 1.8 million units for the year. However, the analyst emphasizes the substantial risk associated with 2024 expectations, citing both growth and earnings concerns. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has reportedly acknowledged entering an intermediate lower-growth phase, particularly following the robust growth of Model 3 and Y vehicles over the past five years. The company is seen as approaching its full volume potential before introducing its next-generation platform."", 'Here is what\xa0White Brook Capital\xa0has to say about Tesla, Inc.

Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”', 'Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +2.00\xa0(+4.81%)', 'On December 14, UBS Group revised its target for Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV), lowering it from $63.00 to $57.00. Despite the reduction in the price target, the financial institution has maintained its Buy rating for Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) stock. As of the latest available data, the current market price for Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) stands at $43.02, indicating a notable positive change in price of 4.81%. This adjustment in the target by UBS Group suggests a recalibration of expectations for Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) performance, reflecting the dynamic nature of the financial markets. The Buy rating, however, signals the belief that there is still perceived value in Ovintiv Inc.

We view the company as competitively advantaged with a strong balance sheet, sustainable growth pathway and an effective management team. Going forward CVX expects improved cost efficiencies and production growth via its differentiated position in the Permian Basin and recent acquisition of Noble Energy. Additionally, management believes a combination of its new higher-margin projects along with operational improvements will drive a double-digit return of capital employed by 2027. Although oil and gas prices, which lay outside of the company’s control, ultimately dictate Chevron’s earnings and cashflow profile, the organization is laser focused on capital discipline. It is this lack of predictability, and potential fear of a global recession which presented us with an opportunity to initiate a position in this high barrier to entry producer at reasonable prices.”', 'Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +1.54\xa0(+3.54%)', 'On December 14, UBS Group has revised its target for Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) from $52.00 to $48.00, maintaining a Neutral rating for the stock.

The target adjustment by UBS Group suggests a reassessment of the expected performance of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), factoring in market conditions and industry dynamics. Despite the target reduction, the Neutral rating signals a stance of neither particularly bullish nor bearish, implying a more balanced perspective on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) prospects.', 'Similar to the negative sentiment surrounding Biogen Inc.

Selling at an average price of US$461, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale."", 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals ', ""The insider, Dale Asplund, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$6.7m worth of shares at a price of US$475 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$572. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 100% of Dale Asplund's holding."", ""United Rentals insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!"", 'If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.', ""Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at United Rentals. Specifically, Independent Director Terri Kelly ditched US$302k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", 'Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. United Rentals insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$166m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.', ""An insider hasn't bought United Rentals stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since United Rentals is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

While the professionals have their reasons for suggesting greater diversification, I intend to apply principles from investing greats Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett and keep everything with my top holdings the same."", 'In his 1988 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett wrote: ""We are just the opposite of those who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform well but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint. Peter Lynch aptly likens such behavior to cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.""', 'In other words, Buffett agrees with Lynch on a specific investing approach. They hold on to shares when those companies perform well, and they sell shares when those businesses disappoint. Most portfolio-building approaches do the opposite; they book their gains by selling winners while doubling down on losers.', ""For perspective, the five stocks I'm highlighting in this article make up just 18% of my portfolio's cost basis -- a very mundane average allocation of about 3.5% each. I've invested more money into other stocks in my portfolio.

And yet the largest equipment-rental company in the U.S. is still relatively unknown to investors. This highlights how boring the market finds this space.', 'In this case, boring is good. United Rentals is a very profitable company with a long record of strong free cash flow generation. And because investors tend to ignore the space, the company can often buy out competitors at cheap valuations.

That said, Crocs has a fantastic operating margin of around 26%, as the chart shows, which makes it attractive to me as an investment."", ""With strong profitability, Crocs can do simple things that boost shareholder value, such as repurchasing shares and reducing its long-term debt. And trading at less than 10 times its trailing earnings, the stock is cheap enough to be a winner with even modest growth -- I wouldn't expect its valuation to fall much from here."", 'Tanger is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns 39 outlet malls and open-air shopping centers. Many of its tenants are in the discretionary sector, which admittedly is a little risky. That said, the company has long enjoyed occupancy rates at around 98%, which also happened to be its occupancy rate as of the third quarter of 2023.', 'This company has a chance to meaningfully increase cash flow in coming years. Almost 60% of its current annual base rate rents are due for renewal between now and the end of 2026. Raising rents would increase cash flow and potentially increase the money available for dividends.', 'As a REIT, Tanger is obligated to pay a percentage of its profits out as dividends. It already provides a high yield at about 4%, but that could increase in a big way. The company would have to raise its dividend by almost 50% to fully recover to where it was before the pandemic -- business is back, so this seems doable. Moreover, if it can steadily increase rents in coming years, then that adds extra cash flow to boost dividends even further.', ""Over time, my bad investments have dropped in value, whereas the five stocks mentioned here have jumped.

If you want to skip our overview of the real estate sector and the latest news, then take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. ', ""In today's high interest rate environment, the real estate sector has been one of the most dynamic industries. Like banking, real estate is also quite sensitive to high rates as they impact the demand for properties and also make financing new and existing projects costlier. This has been evident in the commercial and office real estate industry, as the growth in work from home trends combined with high rates has shaken up the environment in which these companies operate."", ""To understand the scope of the downturn in the office real estate industry, consider the American Institute of Architects (AIA)'s AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index. Like production indexes that measure the size of activity in industries, this index measures the business that architecture firms receive. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the sector, and during October, the ABI stood at 44.3 to mark a nearly three year low reading that eclipsed the downturn in the segment in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic's disruptions were at their peak. More worryingly, the architecture firms also reported that not only did the value of new contracts drop for the third consecutive month, but inquiries for new projects dropped for the first time since July 2020."", 'Building on this, the chief executive officer of the asset manager TCW Group - who is a major bondholder in the real estate market - believes that the commercial real estate market is due for a serious shakeup. Speaking to CNBC, Katie Koch shared in October 2023 that as much as one third of existing office space will be removed from the market in order to readjust it to the current status quo. According to her, this resizing will be focused primarily on non top tier office properties, a view that was also presented by the Washington, D.C. based real estate market data and intelligence provider CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP).', ""CoStar's analysis believes that even though commercial real estate is undergoing seismic level shifts, ironically, these changes will also increase the demand for top tier, Grade A office properties. This is because as the office real estate market shrinks, the demand for existing products will increase. When combined with a return to normalcy for working trends, big ticket firms will be eager to get their hands on lucrative properties and consequently drive up their demand."", ""Shifting gears, another real estate sector that's been in the news a lot in 2023 is the residential sector. Residential real estate companies faced a roaring market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as low rates and growing work from home trends incentivized workers to buy homes in suburban and other localities. This helped them beef up their margins and offer low mortgage rates later on even after the Federal Reserve's multiple 75 basis point interest rate hikes. In fact, the hype surrounding the residential real estate sector reached a feverish pitch in August when the Q2 2023 hedge fund filings started to roll in. They showed that none other than Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway piled into the real estate sector. During Q2, the Oracle of Omaha pumped $814 million into three home building companies. These are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc.

Over these time -- over time, these steps will hopefully bring inflation to desired levels. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in a more orderly fashion. And while the Fed is working to reduce overall capital levels, the elimination of sharp turns and aggressive moves is generally constructive to consumers finding access to enough capital for their necessities, and housing is a necessity.', 'Against that backdrop, the current housing market is generally defined by a very short supply of affordable products and strong demand for affordable products. The consumers have now adjusted to and accepted ""higher for longer"" interest rates and are willing to purchase or rent what they can afford. The consumer is employed and is confident they will remain employed and likely with a higher wage. Higher rates, with need driving demand and housing in short supply, is the new normal, and the consumer understands that the cost of housing will likely continue to be higher. Generally speaking, strong demand for housing has returned within the limits of affordability. The market has attracted consumers by adjusting prices, increasing incentives, including rate buy-downs, and driving down production costs in order to enable consumers to afford needed shelter, and customers have responded.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most profitable real estate stocks.

If you want to skip our overview of the real estate sector and the latest news, then take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. ', ""In today's high interest rate environment, the real estate sector has been one of the most dynamic industries. Like banking, real estate is also quite sensitive to high rates as they impact the demand for properties and also make financing new and existing projects costlier. This has been evident in the commercial and office real estate industry, as the growth in work from home trends combined with high rates has shaken up the environment in which these companies operate."", ""To understand the scope of the downturn in the office real estate industry, consider the American Institute of Architects (AIA)'s AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index. Like production indexes that measure the size of activity in industries, this index measures the business that architecture firms receive. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the sector, and during October, the ABI stood at 44.3 to mark a nearly three year low reading that eclipsed the downturn in the segment in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic's disruptions were at their peak. More worryingly, the architecture firms also reported that not only did the value of new contracts drop for the third consecutive month, but inquiries for new projects dropped for the first time since July 2020."", 'Building on this, the chief executive officer of the asset manager TCW Group - who is a major bondholder in the real estate market - believes that the commercial real estate market is due for a serious shakeup. Speaking to CNBC, Katie Koch shared in October 2023 that as much as one third of existing office space will be removed from the market in order to readjust it to the current status quo. According to her, this resizing will be focused primarily on non top tier office properties, a view that was also presented by the Washington, D.C. based real estate market data and intelligence provider CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP).', ""CoStar's analysis believes that even though commercial real estate is undergoing seismic level shifts, ironically, these changes will also increase the demand for top tier, Grade A office properties. This is because as the office real estate market shrinks, the demand for existing products will increase. When combined with a return to normalcy for working trends, big ticket firms will be eager to get their hands on lucrative properties and consequently drive up their demand."", ""Shifting gears, another real estate sector that's been in the news a lot in 2023 is the residential sector. Residential real estate companies faced a roaring market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as low rates and growing work from home trends incentivized workers to buy homes in suburban and other localities. This helped them beef up their margins and offer low mortgage rates later on even after the Federal Reserve's multiple 75 basis point interest rate hikes. In fact, the hype surrounding the residential real estate sector reached a feverish pitch in August when the Q2 2023 hedge fund filings started to roll in. They showed that none other than Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway piled into the real estate sector. During Q2, the Oracle of Omaha pumped $814 million into three home building companies. These are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), and for more details, you can read Warren Buffett’s 11 Growth Stock Picks."", ""As to the current state of the housing market, here's what the management of Lennar Corporation had to say during the firm's Q3 2023 earnings call:"", 'It seems that we have entered a phase of more measured adjustments in order to curtail inflation, while the Fed shrinks its balance sheet by approximately $100 billion per month and engages other mechanisms to reduce capital in the market. Over these time -- over time, these steps will hopefully bring inflation to desired levels. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in a more orderly fashion. And while the Fed is working to reduce overall capital levels, the elimination of sharp turns and aggressive moves is generally constructive to consumers finding access to enough capital for their necessities, and housing is a necessity.', 'Against that backdrop, the current housing market is generally defined by a very short supply of affordable products and strong demand for affordable products. The consumers have now adjusted to and accepted ""higher for longer"" interest rates and are willing to purchase or rent what they can afford. The consumer is employed and is confident they will remain employed and likely with a higher wage. Higher rates, with need driving demand and housing in short supply, is the new normal, and the consumer understands that the cost of housing will likely continue to be higher. Generally speaking, strong demand for housing has returned within the limits of affordability. The market has attracted consumers by adjusting prices, increasing incentives, including rate buy-downs, and driving down production costs in order to enable consumers to afford needed shelter, and customers have responded.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most profitable real estate stocks. Some top picks are Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc.

Since taking the reins at Berkshire, Buffett has doubled the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 (19.8% vs. 9.9%), as of the end of 2022."", ""Yet what's particularly noteworthy about Buffett's success is that it's the result of prescient investments in a relatively small number of companies. Based on a combination of reported and estimated cost bases, Wall Street's most-revered investor and his team are sitting on $196.2 billion in unrealized gains (not counting dividends received) from just four well-known companies."", ""Perhaps this comes as no surprise, but the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's $364 billion investment portfolio has been one heck of an investment. Based on the $39.62-per-share cost basis estimated by WhaleWisdom.com, tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is responsible for a greater than $140 billion unrealized gain for Buffett's company. Not bad for a stock that Berkshire has been holding for less than eight years."", ""Apple's greatness largely derives from its innovation. It's been a leading provider of smartphones since introducing the original iPhone in 2007. In the U.S., it's consistently accounted for half or more of smartphone market share since upgrading the iPhone to handle 5G download speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020."", ""But what investors seem most excited about is Apple's ongoing evolution. Under CEO Tim Cook, Apple is becoming a platforms company that's emphasizing subscription services."", ""Make no mistake, Apple has exceptionally loyal customers and plenty of pricing power. It's also not abandoning the physical products that consumers obviously love (iPhone, Mac, and iPad). However, bolstering its portfolio to include subscription services will increase its operating margin over time, further enhance loyalty to Apple's ecosystem of products and services, and is expected to smooth out the revenue lumpiness associated with major iPhone upgrade cycles."", ""Although it trails Apple by a wide margin, credit-services provider American Express (NYSE: AXP) has been nothing short of an incredible investment for Warren Buffett and his team, which included the late, great Charlie Munger. With Berkshire reporting a cost basis in AmEx of approximately $8.49 per share, Buffett's company is sitting on more than $24 billion in unrealized gains, not including dividends."", ""American Express's success as a business is a function of its ability to play both sides of the transaction aisle. In addition to being the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., AmEx is a lender to businesses and consumers. This allows it to collect interest income and/or annual fees from its cardholders."", 'Something else working in favor of American Express is its choice to focus on high-earning consumers. Well-to-do cardholders are far less likely to alter their spending habits or fail to pay their bills than the average American. This positions AmEx to navigate economic downturns better than its peers.', ""Don't forget that macroeconomic factors are also AmEx's friend. Although financial stocks are cyclical and struggle during periods of contraction, recessions are short-lived. Only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months, and none have surpassed 18 months. Meanwhile, two economic expansions over the past 78 years have endured longer than a decade. Financial stocks like American Express benefit from long-winded periods of expansion."", ""The third Buffett stock that's generated a veritable smorgasbord of gains for the Oracle of Omaha's company is beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coke is Berkshire's longest continuous holding (since 1988) and sports a cost basis of just $3.2475 per share. With a current share price north of $59, it means Buffett and his investing aides are sitting on gains of well over $22 billion."", ""Also, keep in mind that Coca-Cola has raised its base annual dividend for 61 consecutive years, and is currently doling out $1.84 per share. Relative to Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis, Buffett's company is netting a nearly 57% yield on cost. Put another way, the Oracle of Omaha's company is more than doubling its initial investment in Coca-Cola every two years based solely on the dividend income it's receiving."", 'Geographic diversity is a big reason Coca-Cola has been such a bubbling investment for the past 35 years. Aside from North Korea, Cuba, and Russia, it has operations in every other country. This allows Coke to generate predictable operating cash flow in developed markets, while also benefiting from stronger organic growth opportunities in emerging market countries. The company has 26 brands generating at least $1 billion in worldwide sales.', ""Coca-Cola's other source of success is its top-tier marketing. It's been aggressively investing in digital advertising and relying on artificial intelligence to cater ads to younger audiences. Meanwhile, Coke has decades-long ties to the holidays and can lean on well-known brand ambassadors to connect with more mature consumers."", ""The fourth and final stock that, collectively with Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola, is responsible for generating more than $196 billion in unrealized gains for Warren Buffett and his team is credit-rating agency Moody's (NYSE: MCO)."", ""The theme of this list tends to be patience. Apple's large gains are a function of its outperformance since Berkshire's initial investment in the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, AmEx, Coca-Cola, and Moody's have been continuous holdings since 1991, 1988, and 2000, respectively. It's the epitome of allowing time and compounding to work their magic."", ""According to Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders that was released last year, Berkshire has a per-share cost basis of $10.05 in Moody's. With Moody's stock climbing above $377 on Dec. 11, it means Berkshire stake has increased in value by more than $9 billion, not including dividends paid."", ""For more than a decade, Moody's credit-rating segment has been its driving force. Historically low interest rates encouraged companies to borrow in order to hire, acquire, innovate, and expand. The need to rate new debt issuances kept Moody's analysts busy, as well as lined the company's pockets."", ""But things have changed as interest rates have soared over the past 21 months. With fewer corporate debt issuances, Moody's Analytics segment is now doing the heavy lifting. This division, which helps businesses stay compliant with regulations and assists with risk assessment, is perfectly positioned to thrive in the current economic climate."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

However, there might not be a trade-off between higher dividends and increased profit growth, as reported by Newton Investment Management. In fact, giving dividends could encourage companies to manage their funds more wisely. In their paper titled Surprise! Higher Dividends = Higher Earnings Growth, Robert D. Arnott and Clifford S. Asness found a positive relationship between how much a company pays in dividends and its future earnings growth in the US market over seven decades until 2001. This suggests that paying dividends promotes better control over capital, potentially leading to stronger long-term returns. Additionally, companies that generate high returns on invested capital (ROIC) and carefully reinvest their capital are more likely to sustain a healthy and growing dividend. The report highlighted research by Conover et al. (2016), which conducted an extensive empirical study spanning more than five decades, from 1962 to 2014, using US market data. Their research revealed that investing in stocks that pay dividends not only boosts returns but also notably diminishes the risk associated with both value and growth portfolios. This outcome held true across various market capitalizations, indicating that the benefits of investing in dividend-paying stocks extend beyond specific sectors or company sizes."", ""When examining the broader scope of dividend stocks without isolating their performance to specific periods, it becomes evident that dividends consistently play a significant role in contributing to the overall market returns. Dividends have played a significant role in stock market returns, contributing to 40% of the total returns since 1930 and rising to 54% during periods of high inflation. Particularly during these inflationary times, stocks that consistently raised their dividends outpaced the overall market performance. Moreover, dividend payments can serve as a stabilizing force, potentially reducing the overall volatility in a stock's total return. This stability often appeals to investors looking for steadier income streams and less fluctuation in their investment portfolios."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

GIS is scheduled to come up with second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Dec 20. Let’s take a closer look at the company’s Pet segment, which constituted nearly 12% of its total sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.', 'Although General Mills’ Pet segment has been driving the company’s performance, the unit is likely to have witnessed some hurdles in the quarter to be reported.', 'General Mills, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Mills, Inc. Quote', 'GIS is bearing the brunt of the lower impacts of inflation-justified pricing, along with consumers’ shift toward value products stemming from an uncertain economic landscape. The company’s Pet segment retail sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were somewhat affected by these aspects, including pet parents’ shift toward value products and channels, along with smaller pack sizes.Additionally, GIS is witnessing challenges in the wet food and treats categories, with pet parents spending more time at work or away from home. In the first quarter, segment sales remained flat year over year at $580 million as pricing was countered by soft pound volumes.On its last earnings call, management stated that it expects the difficult category dynamics to persist in the Pet segment throughout fiscal 2024 as it does not see any major change in the economic viewpoint for pet parents in the near term. This remains a concern for the quarter under review.Our model suggests Pet segment revenues will grow 4.5% to $619.6 million in the second quarter and form 11.4% of the company’s total revenues.General Mills’ Pet segment mainly constitutes Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc., which was acquired by GIS in fiscal 2018. Following this acquisition, General Mills became one of the leading players in the pet food arena. Blue Buffalo manufactures and markets wholesome natural pet food items and is contributing to General Mills’ top line.

On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that the biggest factors impacting its performance in fiscal 2024 are likely to be consumers’ economic status, the moderating rate of cost inflation and the rising stability of supply-chain status.

However, the sector can still do very well even at current prices. In fact, many companies are banking on oil staying where it is or suffering only a minor decline. Here's why the energy sector is set up nicely for 2024 and why it could be worth investing in now."", 'The last few months have featured a flurry of mergers and acquisitions on the upstream side of the energy sector. In October, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) announced an all-stock merger with Permian Basin producer Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5 billion. Later that month, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announced a merger with Hess for $53 billion, gaining access to the oil reserves offshore Guyana among other global plays. And earlier this month, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) announced a $12 billion acquisition of privately held Permian producer CrownRock.', ""In the case of Exxon and Oxy, the idea is to get more acreage in a familiar region. This approach can save costs through synergies and boost free cash flow (FCF) if done right. Chevron's deal is a diversification move. It gives it access to a low-cost offshore oil play, which pairs nicely with its existing Permian and liquefied natural gas position."", ""The deals vary in scope and scale. But the rationale behind them is the same: produce more oil and gas at a lower cost per barrel. It's good old-fashioned leverage that can amplify gains during certain conditions and compound losses if oil prices take a turn for the worse."", ""On Dec. 6, ExxonMobil published a corporate plan centered around doubling its earnings by 2027 based on Brent crude oil (the international benchmark) averaging $60 a barrel. However, it also said that 90% of its planned upstream capital investments over the next five years will be able to return 10% or more even if Brent crude oil is $35 a barrel. That's a massive margin for error on the downside and plenty of upside potential even for mediocre oil prices."", 'Assuming its merger with Hess goes through, Chevron expects to be able to double its free cash flow by 2027. On the downside, Chevron said it is ""built for $50 Brent,"" as it can cover its capital expenditures and dividend payments at that level in addition to its operating costs.', 'Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum expects to be able to generate an additional $1 billion in free cash flow in the first year following its acquisition, assuming $70 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (the U.S. benchmark). Oxy also said that the acquisition increased the portion of its unconventional portfolio that can break even below $40 oil by 33%.', 'Exxon, Chevron, and Oxy are just a few of the many upstream producers. But in general, a lot of upstream corporate plans are based around breaking even somewhere around $40 a barrel, and assuming a price of $60 to $70 to fund long-term growth. For example, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) has a 10-year plan to grow FCF at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 11% per year based on $60 WTI oil prices. But ConocoPhillips can also achieve FCF breakeven at $35 per barrel of WTI crude.', ""As much as oil and gas producers will try to build a growth plan around a certain price range, there's simply no telling what energy prices will do in the short term. Even if oil prices take a huge dip, many producers have the balance sheets needed to weather the storm. Sure, companies like Oxy are taking on a lot of debt and banking on at least decent oil prices."", 'But in the case of Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, these companies can still fund growth plans even if oil prices fall, and pause buybacks and pull back on spending if prices collapse. Moreover, these three companies sport excellent balance sheets, with total net long-term debt positions and debt-to-capital leverage ratios near 10-year lows.', 'In short, the balance sheets and the cost profiles of many top producers should allow these companies to thrive even if oil prices stay the same or fall to an extent. While the industry as a whole should rake in the cash if oil prices rebound to levels they were at just a few months ago (in the $80 to $90 WTI range).', ""Although the integrated majors and upstream producers make up the majority of the energy sector, there's still the transportation and storage (midstream) and refining and marketing (downstream) segments to consider."", ""Many midstream companies feature slow growth but pay high dividends thanks to the reliability that comes from long-term contracts. These contracts, many of which are take-or-pay (paid no matter what) or fee-based (locked-in prices) limit exposure to oil and gas prices. Many companies want to avoid over-expanding or building infrastructure that won't be needed as the energy transition accelerates in the years to come. Overall, the midstream industry is a good value with manageable debt and attractive dividends."", 'Downstream leaders like Valero, Marathon Petroleum, and Phillips 66 also have inexpensive valuations. Despite excellent results, many downstream stocks have sold off over the last few months. Renewable energy is having a major impact on power generation. And electric vehicles have certainly pierced the passenger vehicle market. But refining crude oil into useful sources is an essential process that underpins modern society and the transportation industry.', 'The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE), which tracks the performance of the broader energy sector, has a yield of 3.6% and a price to earnings ratio of just 7.5. Granted, these earnings are based on the last 12 months, which featured higher oil prices. But still, the sector is cheap and does a good job of unlocking income and value from the integrated majors, conservative producers, the midstream industry, and the downstream industry, which also balances out the high risk and volatility that comes with more aggressive and smaller producers.', 'The sector stands out as a haven for value and passive income, as well as strong earnings results, even if oil and gas prices stay the same or modestly decline.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?', 'Before you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ExxonMobil wasn't one of them.

And to build up that speed, organize operations in fulfillment centers, and more, the company uses AI.', ""In fact, Amazon has been using it for a while now, but has stepped up its investments in recent times. In e-commerce, AI streamlines operations, which should eventually lower the company's costs. And the use of AI results in better service to customers, which encourages them to come back, translating into more revenue for Amazon."", ""The company also has increased investment in AI as part of its cloud computing service, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The stock is down a little over 4% year to date, compared to a near 20% gain for the S&P 500. To be fair, the underperformance is expected. A stodgy dividend-paying stock like P&G is likely to underperform in a great market year, simply because epic years of outperformance are usually driven by growth stocks, not income and value securities.', 'On the flip side, P&G stands a good chance of outperforming the S&P 500 during a below-average year or a down year as we saw in 2022.', ""P&G is an excellent company that's being overlooked in favor of faster-growing, flashier names right now. But long-term investors know that times like this usually prove to be wise buying opportunities over the long run."", ""Here's why P&G is a top Dividend King to buy for 2024 and a better opportunity than another similar Dividend King -- Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO)."", ""If you're investing in a stock like P&G, it's not because you're trying to beat the market in a certain year but because you view the company as a good value that will offer passive income for years. P&G has given investors every reason to count on it no matter what the market is doing."", 'The company is one of the longest-tenured Dividend Kings, having paid and raised its dividend for 67 consecutive years. Given the low-growth nature of its portfolio of consumer staples brands, P&G has limited options for efficient capital deployment within its business. Instead, it turns to buying back its own stock and raising its dividend, which makes the stock a better value for long-term investors.', ""What has been particularly impressive about P&G over the last two years or so is its pricing power. P&G's sales volumes have taken a hit due to inflationary pressures. To combat these pressures, the company has turned to steep price increases across its product lines, which have been largely absorbed by customers."", ""In its recent quarter, P&G implemented a 7% average price increase across the board, which contributed all of the organic growth in the face of a 1% overall decline in volume. The company's ability to pass along higher costs to consumers is a testament to its brand power -- which sounds a little strange."", ""After all, is Tide detergent really that much better than the generic brand? But the results indicate that P&G has a secret sauce that's working."", ""2022 and 2023 provided a stress test for P&G, proving that the company can do well, even in an inflationary environment. It's already known that P&G does well in a recession, given its performance isn't closely correlated to the broader economy. So the fact it did well, given the recent circumstances, is a vote of confidence that the stock is worth buying and holding."", ""P&G's 23.6 price-to-earnings ratio and 2.6% dividend yield aren't eye-catching on the surface, especially for value investors or those interested in a high yield. But the company makes up for its premium valuation and decent yield with its reliability. After all, what good is a high yield if the capital losses outweigh the dividend income?"", 'Over the last five years, P&G has given investors a solid total return (nearly as good as the S&P 500), while boosting its dividend by over 30% and reducing its share count by over 5%.', ""Over the years, P&G has proven that it isn't solely an income stream, unlike other stodgy dividend stocks that drastically underperform the market. But rather, P&G is likely to produce a blend of dividend income and capital gains over time."", 'Speaking of stodgy stocks that underperform the market, Coke is another well-known Dividend King with an equally impressive track record of dividend raises.

The company executes during difficult climates when many of its peers are struggling. Its margins have stayed strong throughout this inflationary period, thanks to the company's pricing power."", ""P&G trades at a slight premium to the S&P 500 but deserves it.

That's because the Oracle of Omaha has been running circles around Wall Street's major indexes for more than a half-century. Since taking the reins at Berkshire, Buffett has doubled the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 (19.8% vs. 9.9%), as of the end of 2022."", ""Yet what's particularly noteworthy about Buffett's success is that it's the result of prescient investments in a relatively small number of companies. Based on a combination of reported and estimated cost bases, Wall Street's most-revered investor and his team are sitting on $196.2 billion in unrealized gains (not counting dividends received) from just four well-known companies."", ""Perhaps this comes as no surprise, but the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's $364 billion investment portfolio has been one heck of an investment. Based on the $39.62-per-share cost basis estimated by WhaleWisdom.com, tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is responsible for a greater than $140 billion unrealized gain for Buffett's company. Not bad for a stock that Berkshire has been holding for less than eight years."", ""Apple's greatness largely derives from its innovation. It's been a leading provider of smartphones since introducing the original iPhone in 2007. In the U.S., it's consistently accounted for half or more of smartphone market share since upgrading the iPhone to handle 5G download speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020."", ""But what investors seem most excited about is Apple's ongoing evolution. Under CEO Tim Cook, Apple is becoming a platforms company that's emphasizing subscription services."", ""Make no mistake, Apple has exceptionally loyal customers and plenty of pricing power. It's also not abandoning the physical products that consumers obviously love (iPhone, Mac, and iPad). However, bolstering its portfolio to include subscription services will increase its operating margin over time, further enhance loyalty to Apple's ecosystem of products and services, and is expected to smooth out the revenue lumpiness associated with major iPhone upgrade cycles."", ""Although it trails Apple by a wide margin, credit-services provider American Express (NYSE: AXP) has been nothing short of an incredible investment for Warren Buffett and his team, which included the late, great Charlie Munger. With Berkshire reporting a cost basis in AmEx of approximately $8.49 per share, Buffett's company is sitting on more than $24 billion in unrealized gains, not including dividends."", ""American Express's success as a business is a function of its ability to play both sides of the transaction aisle. In addition to being the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., AmEx is a lender to businesses and consumers. This allows it to collect interest income and/or annual fees from its cardholders."", 'Something else working in favor of American Express is its choice to focus on high-earning consumers. Well-to-do cardholders are far less likely to alter their spending habits or fail to pay their bills than the average American. This positions AmEx to navigate economic downturns better than its peers.', ""Don't forget that macroeconomic factors are also AmEx's friend. Although financial stocks are cyclical and struggle during periods of contraction, recessions are short-lived. Only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months, and none have surpassed 18 months. Meanwhile, two economic expansions over the past 78 years have endured longer than a decade. Financial stocks like American Express benefit from long-winded periods of expansion."", ""The third Buffett stock that's generated a veritable smorgasbord of gains for the Oracle of Omaha's company is beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coke is Berkshire's longest continuous holding (since 1988) and sports a cost basis of just $3.2475 per share. With a current share price north of $59, it means Buffett and his investing aides are sitting on gains of well over $22 billion."", ""Also, keep in mind that Coca-Cola has raised its base annual dividend for 61 consecutive years, and is currently doling out $1.84 per share. Relative to Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis, Buffett's company is netting a nearly 57% yield on cost. Put another way, the Oracle of Omaha's company is more than doubling its initial investment in Coca-Cola every two years based solely on the dividend income it's receiving."", 'Geographic diversity is a big reason Coca-Cola has been such a bubbling investment for the past 35 years. Aside from North Korea, Cuba, and Russia, it has operations in every other country. This allows Coke to generate predictable operating cash flow in developed markets, while also benefiting from stronger organic growth opportunities in emerging market countries. The company has 26 brands generating at least $1 billion in worldwide sales.', ""Coca-Cola's other source of success is its top-tier marketing. It's been aggressively investing in digital advertising and relying on artificial intelligence to cater ads to younger audiences. Meanwhile, Coke has decades-long ties to the holidays and can lean on well-known brand ambassadors to connect with more mature consumers."", ""The fourth and final stock that, collectively with Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola, is responsible for generating more than $196 billion in unrealized gains for Warren Buffett and his team is credit-rating agency Moody's (NYSE: MCO)."", ""The theme of this list tends to be patience. Apple's large gains are a function of its outperformance since Berkshire's initial investment in the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, AmEx, Coca-Cola, and Moody's have been continuous holdings since 1991, 1988, and 2000, respectively. It's the epitome of allowing time and compounding to work their magic."", ""According to Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders that was released last year, Berkshire has a per-share cost basis of $10.05 in Moody's. With Moody's stock climbing above $377 on Dec. 11, it means Berkshire stake has increased in value by more than $9 billion, not including dividends paid."", ""For more than a decade, Moody's credit-rating segment has been its driving force. Historically low interest rates encouraged companies to borrow in order to hire, acquire, innovate, and expand. The need to rate new debt issuances kept Moody's analysts busy, as well as lined the company's pockets."", ""But things have changed as interest rates have soared over the past 21 months. With fewer corporate debt issuances, Moody's Analytics segment is now doing the heavy lifting. This division, which helps businesses stay compliant with regulations and assists with risk assessment, is perfectly positioned to thrive in the current economic climate."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global spirits market, the success of celebrity-owned liquors, and the fastest growing alcohol category in the world, and go directly to 5 Fastest-Growing Spirit Brands in the World.\xa0', 'Alcohol occupies such a central place in the human experience that Galileo Galilei, the father of modern science, once compared wine to sunlight itself. Since booze has been an integral part of human history for thousands of years, it has always been in a constant state of change, trying to keep up with the evolving tastes of its consumers. Adding a hint of flavor has always been the norm, and even the Greeks flavored their beloved wine with everything from honey to seawater. From beer spiked with intoxicants such as henbane to wine infused with rosemary, it’s fair to say that the desire both to enhance the mood-altering effects of alcohol and to improve the taste of an indifferent raw product have been with mankind for millennia.\xa0', 'The spirits industry is overcoming economic headwinds to meet changing consumer preferences as it chips away at the dominance of beer. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the spirits revenue market share grew from 28.7% in 2000 to 42.1% in 2022, while beer held a 41.9% market share last year. Thus, the spirits industry surpassed beer in revenue for the first time ever.\xa0', 'As we mentioned in our article – 25 Most Popular Spirits in the World – the global spirits market is estimated to be at $59.4 billion in 2023, and is expected to be worth around $90.29 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.27% during the forecast period. The rising popularity of premium alcoholic drinks and RTDs owing to higher consumer spending could be one of the key factors for the rapid development of the spirits industry.\xa0', 'The alcoholic beverage industry is unquestionably a profitable one and a growing number of celebrities are investing their time and money in the spirits business by backing brands and forging partnerships. These ventures have often proven to be quite lucrative.\xa0', 'Of course, a celebrity-backed investment offer is also a boon for the brand itself. Numerous studies have already shown that celebrities can affect consumer behavior, especially if the celeb’s image aligns with the brand. Having celebrities as investors can help the brand increase its sales and make it more recognizable to people. The celebrity’s fans or followers will associate the celeb’s positive image with the brand.\xa0', 'In 2017, George Clooney and his co-owners sold Casamigos to spirits giant Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) for $1 billion. It was a headline-grabbing figure that inspired an avalanche of celebrity-backed tequilas to hit the market over the last decade.\xa0', 'One prominent example of a celebrity alcohol brand investment is Ryan Reynolds buying into Aviation Gin in 2018. Like any private equity investor, Reynolds invested in the company, supported it, and cashed out. The key difference is that Reynolds’ participation in the brand was simply earth-shattering. No one can forget the Hollywood superstar’s witty and hilarious marketing skits, and after three years of investment, Ryan Reynolds cashed out with $610 million when Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) acquired the Aviation brand.\xa0', 'Similarly, Jay-Z also sold the majority stake in D’USSÉ – his best-selling cognac brand – to Bacardi this year, in a deal worth approximately $750 million.\xa0', 'For these stars and several others, the gambit has undoubtedly paid off.

(NYSE:DVA), might not be a large cap stock, but it led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on DaVita’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' View our latest analysis for DaVita ', ""Good news, investors! DaVita is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 16.21x is currently well-below the industry average of 22.69x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because DaVita’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. DaVita's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 29%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since DVA is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DVA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DVA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.', ""If you'd like to know more about DaVita as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

However, read between the lines and you may come away with a different perspective.', 'Primarily, we really don’t know what will materialize next. For example, because the labor print came in so hot, Wall Street responded only modestly because the Federal Reserve might delay interest rate cuts. If so, that wouldn’t be great for pure growth-oriented enterprises. However, it could boost high-performing utility stocks due to their underlying indelible nature.', 'And even if the Fed decided to cut rates at the soonest opportunity, reliability utility stocks will still likely benefit. After all, we’re not talking about a cyclical industry here. Rather, whether the economy is humming or dying, people (and businesses) need to pay their bills.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Therefore, high-performing utility stocks deserve extra consideration.', 'Source: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.com', 'A Canadian renewable energy and regulated utility conglomerate, Algonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE:AQN) features assets across North America. Primarily, the company invests in hydroelectric, wind and solar power facilities, along with utility businesses. However, circumstances have not been auspicious for AQN, with shares down about 10% since the start of the year.', 'Still, what AQN ranks among the high-performing utility stocks given the underlying difficult post-pandemic conditions. Despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, Algonquin posted sales growth of 3% in 2020 compared to the prior year. This demonstrates the resilience of utilities-based steady growth investments. Also, on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, its sales clocks in at $2.78 billion, up modestly from 2022’s monstrous growth year.', 'Just as well, Algonquin delivers the goods in terms of passive income. Right now, the company offers a forward yield of 7.15%, well above the average for reliable utility stocks at 3.75%. While the red ink presents value trap concerns, it’s also worth noting that AQN trades at a forward earnings multiple of 10.82x. This could turn out to be a discount.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the more popular enterprises among high-performing utility stocks, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is an electric power and natural gas holding company. Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company covers several compelling states in the eastern region of the nation. I say compelling because young people have been moving to states like the Carolinas for cost-of-living reasons.', 'Stated differently, Duke is positioned where the money will be, adding confidence to the fundamental growth narrative. But keep in mind that Duke financially represents one of the steady growth investments. While 2020 saw a Covid-impacted dip, since then, Duke has been marching higher in the top line. On a TTM basis, it sports sales of $29.2 billion, up from the $28.8 billion posted in 2022.', 'Now, do you pay a premium for this stable growth? At a forward earnings multiple of 15.85X, you do. However, you should also note that Duke offers a forward yield of 4.34%. Also, analysts peg DUK as a consensus moderate buy.', 'Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'Headquartered in Akron, Ohio, FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) is an electric utility. Per its public profile, its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the distribution, transmission and generation of electricity. In addition, it offers energy management and other energy-related services. While a relevant enterprise among high-performing utility stocks, FE lost about 12% of equity value since the January opener.', 'However, I’d be remiss to not point out that in the trailing month, shares gained almost 5%. And since bottoming on Oct. 2, shares have generally printed a series of higher highs and higher lows. Even better, the move doesn’t seem to be based exclusively off of technical hocus pocus. Following a pandemic-disrupted revenue dip in 2020, the company has been steadily expanding the top line.', 'Further, on a TTM basis, FirstEnergy rang up sales of $12.9 billion. That’s noticeably higher than the $12.5 billion it registered for the last fiscal year. Also, TTM net income stands at $524 million, substantially higher than the $406 million in 2022.', 'Regarding passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 4.42%. Thus, it makes a solid case for reliable utility stocks.', 'Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.com', 'Hailing from Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) represents the largest electric parent company in the U.S. by revenue. Per its public profile, it’s also the largest regulated electric utility in the U.S. with approximately 10 million customers. Just from these top-level stats, EXC makes a solid candidate for steady growth investments. To be fair, though, EXC’s loss of 9% since the January opener raises some eyebrows.', 'Nevertheless, if you’re looking for quality high-performing utility stocks, Exelon should be on your radar, especially during these ambiguous times. Now, Exelon appears to have suffered a severe drop in revenue in 2021. That’s due to a splitting of the utility and power generation businesses. Having said that, post-split, Exelon has demonstrated encouraging growth.', 'For example, on a TTM basis, the company posted sales of $21 billion. That’s noticeably higher than the $19.08 billion rung up in 2022. So, it makes for one of the reliable utility stocks. Let’s also not forget that the company offers a forward yield of 3.67%.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is one of the largest utility holding companies in the U.S. with nearly 40 million customers. And since we’re talking about Southern California, these customers are generally better off than average. Another attribute that Sempra benefits from is that SoCal is a destination region and a coastal powerhouse. Stated differently, the area will always be relevant.', 'For that reason, you should consider it one of the high-performing utility stocks built for the long haul.

However, there might not be a trade-off between higher dividends and increased profit growth, as reported by Newton Investment Management. In fact, giving dividends could encourage companies to manage their funds more wisely. In their paper titled Surprise! Higher Dividends = Higher Earnings Growth, Robert D. Arnott and Clifford S. Asness found a positive relationship between how much a company pays in dividends and its future earnings growth in the US market over seven decades until 2001. This suggests that paying dividends promotes better control over capital, potentially leading to stronger long-term returns. Additionally, companies that generate high returns on invested capital (ROIC) and carefully reinvest their capital are more likely to sustain a healthy and growing dividend. The report highlighted research by Conover et al. (2016), which conducted an extensive empirical study spanning more than five decades, from 1962 to 2014, using US market data. Their research revealed that investing in stocks that pay dividends not only boosts returns but also notably diminishes the risk associated with both value and growth portfolios. This outcome held true across various market capitalizations, indicating that the benefits of investing in dividend-paying stocks extend beyond specific sectors or company sizes."", ""When examining the broader scope of dividend stocks without isolating their performance to specific periods, it becomes evident that dividends consistently play a significant role in contributing to the overall market returns. Dividends have played a significant role in stock market returns, contributing to 40% of the total returns since 1930 and rising to 54% during periods of high inflation. Particularly during these inflationary times, stocks that consistently raised their dividends outpaced the overall market performance. Moreover, dividend payments can serve as a stabilizing force, potentially reducing the overall volatility in a stock's total return. This stability often appeals to investors looking for steadier income streams and less fluctuation in their investment portfolios."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Wells Fargo expects annual growth rate to come in at just 0.7% in 2024, compared to its previous forecast of 2.2%.', 'Wells Fargo said that economic headwinds were exacerbated in 2023 by worker strikes, increasing oil prices, resumption of student-loan repayments and outsized budget deficits.', 'However, Wells Fargo said that a decline in interest rates could rekindle consumer spending and things could start to get back to normal near the end of 2024.', 'Our bias remains for modest dollar upside in the first half of 2024, supported by a flight to quality during a global economic slowdown. We also expect the dollar to find support while U.S. interest rates exceed those in the eurozone and Japan. A global economic pivot to recovery later in 2024 should rekindle risk appetite and bring a slightly weaker dollar as capital flows diversify away from the U.S. A moderating interest-rate environment in emerging markets may provide a broad negative driver to emerging-market currencies in 2024. Still, we believe a global economic recovery in the second half of 2024 may benefit emerging markets and help offset the interest-rate environment to drive emerging- market currency gains.', 'Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/ Methodology For this article we first used a stock screener to identify dividend stocks with over 8% dividend yield, Buy or better ratings from Wall Street analysts and analyst price targets that are at least 20% more than their current trading prices.

If you want to skip our overview of the real estate sector and the latest news, then take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Real Estate Stocks Now. ', ""In today's high interest rate environment, the real estate sector has been one of the most dynamic industries. Like banking, real estate is also quite sensitive to high rates as they impact the demand for properties and also make financing new and existing projects costlier. This has been evident in the commercial and office real estate industry, as the growth in work from home trends combined with high rates has shaken up the environment in which these companies operate."", ""To understand the scope of the downturn in the office real estate industry, consider the American Institute of Architects (AIA)'s AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index. Like production indexes that measure the size of activity in industries, this index measures the business that architecture firms receive. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the sector, and during October, the ABI stood at 44.3 to mark a nearly three year low reading that eclipsed the downturn in the segment in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic's disruptions were at their peak. More worryingly, the architecture firms also reported that not only did the value of new contracts drop for the third consecutive month, but inquiries for new projects dropped for the first time since July 2020."", 'Building on this, the chief executive officer of the asset manager TCW Group - who is a major bondholder in the real estate market - believes that the commercial real estate market is due for a serious shakeup. Speaking to CNBC, Katie Koch shared in October 2023 that as much as one third of existing office space will be removed from the market in order to readjust it to the current status quo. According to her, this resizing will be focused primarily on non top tier office properties, a view that was also presented by the Washington, D.C. based real estate market data and intelligence provider CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP).', ""CoStar's analysis believes that even though commercial real estate is undergoing seismic level shifts, ironically, these changes will also increase the demand for top tier, Grade A office properties. This is because as the office real estate market shrinks, the demand for existing products will increase. When combined with a return to normalcy for working trends, big ticket firms will be eager to get their hands on lucrative properties and consequently drive up their demand."", ""Shifting gears, another real estate sector that's been in the news a lot in 2023 is the residential sector. Residential real estate companies faced a roaring market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as low rates and growing work from home trends incentivized workers to buy homes in suburban and other localities. This helped them beef up their margins and offer low mortgage rates later on even after the Federal Reserve's multiple 75 basis point interest rate hikes. In fact, the hype surrounding the residential real estate sector reached a feverish pitch in August when the Q2 2023 hedge fund filings started to roll in. They showed that none other than Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway piled into the real estate sector. During Q2, the Oracle of Omaha pumped $814 million into three home building companies. These are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), and for more details, you can read Warren Buffett’s 11 Growth Stock Picks."", ""As to the current state of the housing market, here's what the management of Lennar Corporation had to say during the firm's Q3 2023 earnings call:"", 'It seems that we have entered a phase of more measured adjustments in order to curtail inflation, while the Fed shrinks its balance sheet by approximately $100 billion per month and engages other mechanisms to reduce capital in the market. Over these time -- over time, these steps will hopefully bring inflation to desired levels. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in a more orderly fashion. And while the Fed is working to reduce overall capital levels, the elimination of sharp turns and aggressive moves is generally constructive to consumers finding access to enough capital for their necessities, and housing is a necessity.', 'Against that backdrop, the current housing market is generally defined by a very short supply of affordable products and strong demand for affordable products. The consumers have now adjusted to and accepted ""higher for longer"" interest rates and are willing to purchase or rent what they can afford. The consumer is employed and is confident they will remain employed and likely with a higher wage. Higher rates, with need driving demand and housing in short supply, is the new normal, and the consumer understands that the cost of housing will likely continue to be higher. Generally speaking, strong demand for housing has returned within the limits of affordability. The market has attracted consumers by adjusting prices, increasing incentives, including rate buy-downs, and driving down production costs in order to enable consumers to afford needed shelter, and customers have responded.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most profitable real estate stocks.

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.', ""With earnings that are retreating more than the market's of late, Ameriprise Financial has been very sluggish. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think the company's earnings trend will eventually fall in line with most others in the market. If you still like the company, you'd want its earnings trajectory to turn around before making any decisions. Or at the very least, you'd be hoping it doesn't keep underperforming if your plan is to pick up some stock while it's not in favour."", ' View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ', ""Keen to find out how analysts think Ameriprise Financial's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start."", ""In order to justify its P/E ratio, Ameriprise Financial would need to produce growth that's similar to the market."", ""Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 26% decrease to the company's bottom line. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 53% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way."", ""Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 21% each year as estimated by the ten analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 12% per annum growth forecast for the broader market."", 'With this information, we find it interesting that Ameriprise Financial is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. Apparently some shareholders are skeptical of the forecasts and have been accepting lower selling prices.', 'Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.', ""Our examination of Ameriprise Financial's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook isn't contributing to its P/E as much as we would have predicted. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the positive outlook. It appears some are indeed anticipating earnings instability, because these conditions should normally provide a boost to the share price."", ""Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial that you should be aware of."", ""If you're unsure about the strength of Ameriprise Financial's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Paying dividends is not one of them. These companies typically reinvest the bulk of their profits into developing new and better tech and attempting to grow their sales.', ""If you dig deep enough, though, you can find a handful of technology stocks that pay surprisingly solid dividends. Here are three you may want to consider stepping into before 2024 arrives. Buying now will help you take advantage of higher interest rates that not only work against growth companies but favor dividend-paying value stocks -- no matter what business they're in."", ""There's no denying that HP (NYSE: HPQ) (formerly known as Hewlett-Packard) isn't close to being the technology titan it once was. Neither consumers nor corporations buy computers as often as they used to. Further, in the early stages of the pandemic, there was a huge surge in computer purchases as people upgraded their machines so they could work and attend school remotely. That pulled a large volume of business forward, and the resulting ripples of lower demand are still being felt: HP's personal computer revenue fell 19% during the fiscal year that ended in October."", 'Even the ultra-patient Warren Buffett is giving up on the company. Berkshire Hathaway has been selling off the stake in HP it began acquiring early last year, likely locking in modest losses.', ""While Berkshire is backing off, you might want to use this misunderstood outfit's recent weakness as an entry point."", ""Yes, HP is in the computer business. PCs account for about two-thirds of its total sales. That segment is not a particularly great profit producer, though. HP's much smaller (by revenue) printing business produces around 60% of its profits, and its printing business is very, very reliable. That's because the paperless offices that computers were supposed to create when they started to become common back in the 1990s have given us the capacity to print more pages than ever. And workers are using that option to the fullest."", 'This, of course, is precisely what makes for a great dividend-paying stock -- an underlying business based on a product the world is willing to pay for over and over again.', ""Newcomers will be plugging into the stock while its dividend yield is just a hair under 3.6%. Its quarterly payout, by the way, has grown from $0.16 per share five years ago to a little over $0.27 per share now. That's an annualized growth rate of a little over 9%."", ""Like HP, IBM (NYSE: IBM) was once royalty among technology names. Not any longer. The company mostly missed out on the rise of cloud computing and mobile connectivity. By the time it started to pivot into those arenas in 2016, it was too late. The stock had already begun a sell-off that would last for years, reflecting the company's lost ground. Many investors have forgotten about IBM in the meantime, presuming it wouldn't recover."", ""Well, those people may want to take a fresh look at the stock now. It just hit a six-year high. And, if the company's new business lines and business model are any indication, more new highs could be in the cards."", ""Simply put, IBM's core focus these days is hybrid cloud computing and all of its ancillary businesses. These add-on businesses range from artificial intelligence to cloud management cybersecurity to automation, to name a few."", 'The thing is, offering such turn-key cloud computing solutions means IBM can generate a combination of software, hardware, and consulting revenue from any given client.', '""Our approach to hybrid cloud is platform-centric,"" CFO Jim Kavanaugh explained during the Q4 2022 earnings call in January. ""As we land a platform, we get a multiplier effect across software, consulting, and infrastructure."" He didn\'t divulge specific numbers at the time, but Kavanaugh has commented in the past that ""for every dollar that we land on [sales of] the [hybrid cloud] platform, we get $3 to $5 of software and $6 to $8 of services revenue.""', ""It seems we're finally seeing the measurable benefit of this dynamic. Last quarter's software revenue was up 8% year over year, while consulting revenue improved 6% on much more modest infrastructure sales growth of only 2%. And this is largely recurring revenue that helps support a dividend. IBM not only maintained its payouts during the rough patch it was going through a few years ago, but it has raised them for 28 consecutive years."", 'At current prices, new investors would be buying the stock with a dividend yield of a little more than 4%.', ""Last but not least, add Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) to your list of dividend-paying technology stocks to buy. Currently, it's yielding a respectable 3.1%."", ""Not unlike IBM and HP, Cisco's glory days came in the late 1990s and early 2000s. That's when it was riding the then-rapid growth of the personal computer market. Cisco's role in that movement was supplying the world with the modems, routers, and switches needed to connect PCs to the internet and to one another. It still manufactures this hardware, although demand isn't quite as fevered now as it was then. New entrants into the ethernet switch and router market are also competitive against market-leading Cisco."", ""The networking hardware business has changed, however, in a way that helps keep Cisco surprisingly competitive. See, in step with other kinds of related technologies, switches, and routers are now powered by adaptable and updatable software. The company did $4.4 billion worth of software business during the fiscal quarter that ended Oct. 28 -- roughly one-third of its total sales. Its subscription-based businesses produced a total of $6.5 billion worth of sales for the quarter, accounting for nearly half of the company's top line."", 'This isn\'t a coincidence. It\'s by design. As CEO Chuck Robbins commented during the earnings call, ""We continue to transform our business toward more software and recurring revenue streams fueled by accelerated innovation."" The word ""recurring"" is key here, as it translates into predictable, reliable cash flow that in turn funds continued dividend payments. To that point, Cisco\'s annualized rate of recurring revenue stands at $24.5 billion, which is just under half of last year\'s total top line.', ""You'll probably never get great growth from Cisco stock. You'll certainly get good income, however, from a dividend that management has now raised for 13 consecutive years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cisco Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cisco Systems, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cisco Systems wasn't one of them.
