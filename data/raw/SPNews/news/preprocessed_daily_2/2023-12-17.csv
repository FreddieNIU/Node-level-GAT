A recent transaction by a high-ranking insider at Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE) has caught the attention of investors and market analysts alike.Co-President and Regional Market Director (RMD) Daniel Ryan sold 10,000 shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc on December 13, 2023. This move prompts a deeper look into the insider's history, the company's business model, and the potential implications of such a sale on the stock's valuation and investor sentiment.Who is Daniel Ryan?Daniel Ryan serves as the Co-President and RMD of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc, a company that specializes in owning, operating, and developing properties for the life sciences industry. His role involves overseeing key markets and ensuring the company's strategic growth aligns with the burgeoning demand for life sciences real estate. Ryan's tenure and position within the company make his trading activities particularly noteworthy to shareholders and potential investors.About Alexandria Real Estate Equities IncAlexandria Real Estate Equities Inc is a prominent urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. With a mission to create and sustain environments that inspire innovators and enhance the probability of their success, Alexandria has established a significant presence in the life sciences real estate sector. The company's properties are designed to foster collaboration and support the complex and critical needs of the world's leading scientists and technologists.Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and Relationship with Stock PriceOver the past year, Daniel Ryan has exclusively engaged in the sale of shares, with a total of 10,000 shares sold and no recorded purchases. This one-sided transaction history may raise questions about the insider's confidence in the company's short-term growth potential or personal portfolio diversification strategies.The broader insider transaction history for Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc reveals a pattern of more sells than buys over the past year, with 8 insider sells and no insider buys. This trend could suggest that insiders, as a group, believe the stock may be fully valued or that they are taking profits off the table amid broader market conditions."", ""When examining the relationship between insider selling and stock price, it's important to consider the context of each transaction. Insider sells can occur for various reasons unrelated to the company's performance, such as personal financial planning or diversifying assets. However, persistent selling by multiple insiders over time may warrant a closer look by investors.Valuation and Market ResponseOn the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc were trading at $118.07, giving the company a market cap of $22.615 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 93.63 is significantly higher than both the industry median of 17.73 and the company's historical median, suggesting a premium valuation compared to its peers and its own past.Despite the high price-earnings ratio, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued based on the GuruFocus Value (GF Value) of $182.32. The price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.65 indicates that the stock may be trading below its intrinsic value, potentially offering an attractive entry point for value-oriented investors."", ""The GF Value is calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts. This comprehensive approach to valuation provides a nuanced perspective that may differ from market sentiment or short-term price movements.ConclusionThe sale of 10,000 shares by Co-President Daniel Ryan is a transaction that merits attention, but it should not be viewed in isolation. Investors should consider the company's strong position in the life sciences real estate market, the broader insider selling trend, and the stock's current valuation relative to its GF Value. While insider sales can provide valuable clues, they are just one piece of the puzzle in assessing a stock's investment potential.As always, investors are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence, considering both the quantitative data and qualitative factors that influence a company's long-term success. Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc's focus on innovation-driven real estate and its current valuation metrics suggest a company with solid fundamentals, despite the recent insider sell activity."", 'Warning!

Not only does the retailer strive to keeps its prices low, but it also sells a huge variety of everyday household goods and other essentials. Whether you’re looking for kitchen gadgets, apparel, small household appliances, electronics, games, toys, furniture or gardening supplies, you can rest assured that you’ll find some version of what you need at Walmart.', 'See: 9 Things the Rich Never Buy During the Holidays\xa0\xa0Find Out: Pocket an Extra $400 a Month With This Simple Hack', 'Given all of these positives, it might seem surprising that some frequent shoppers would opt to stop going to Walmart altogether. This means no more late-night runs to this international retailer. It also means paying higher prices on similar goods at local shops or smaller retailers.', 'But while it might be hard to break the habit of shopping at Walmart, some people find it more than worthwhile. In fact, GOBankingRates spoke two former frequent Walmart shoppers to see why they stopped giving Walmart their patronage.', 'Here’s why they stopped shopping at Walmart — and what they learned from their decision.', 'Sponsored: The Results Are In: Is your bank one of the best of the year?', 'For many Walmart customers, the savings potential and convenience of shopping where virtually everything is in one location is hard to turn down.', '“I used to shop at Walmart all the time. It was convenient and had everything I needed,” said Michael Larsen, the co-founder and chief financial officer of Dugnadseksperten, a nationwide company dedicated to aiding sports teams and other organizations in Russia. “But a few years ago, I decided to stop shopping there,” Larsen continued.', 'Why? Well, despite the convenience of it all, Larsen found the product quality to be severely lacking.', '“The quality of the products is poor,” said Larsen. “I’ve bought clothes from Walmart that fell apart after a few wears. I’ve bought electronics that broke after a few months. I’ve bought food that was spoiled.”', 'And it wasn’t just quality that turned this frequent Walmart shopper away from the retailer. It was the overall poor customer service, as well. “I found the customer service is terrible,” said Larsen. “The employees don’t have time to help, and the worst part [is that] some of them are not even very knowledgeable about the products.”', 'For Dmitriy Shelepin, CEO and head of SEO at Miromind, his reasons for quitting Walmart were a bit different.', '“I stopped shopping at Walmart because I wanted to support local businesses and prioritize ethical and sustainable practices,” said Shelepin.', 'In both cases, these shoppers’ reasons are rather understandable. Walmart might boast low prices, but that affordability comes at the cost of sustainability and, in many cases, quality.', 'Read More: I Stopped Buying Things From Amazon and Here’s What I Learned', 'One major downside of shopping at Walmart is that it’s all too easy to buy things without really thinking about what you’re buying, who from, or if your purchases support your personal or community values.', 'By quitting Walmart, Shelepin said that he learned the importance of conscious consumerism — that is, the practice of making purchases more mindfully in an effort to support one’s values. He also became more aware of how important it is to support other businesses that align with his values.', '“Overall, I’ve found that stepping away from Walmart has allowed me to make more meaningful and intentional choices in my shopping habits,” said Shelepin.', 'Another cost of Walmart’s convenience and overall affordability is its impact on local businesses. Whenever a major retailer establishes a new location in a community, smaller shops are prone to going out of business. This is also the case with Walmart.', 'Once Shelepin kicked his Walmart habit and started shopping locally, he discovered how vital it is to support local businesses. He also realized how his habits as a consumer can affect the community and environment as a whole.', '“I’ve learned the importance of voting with my wallet and how my purchasing decisions can make a positive impact on communities and the environment,” said Shelepin.', 'Walmarts everywhere have to keep up with high supply and demand. This combined with certain measures to cut costs has led to mixed quality results in Walmart products — another reason why Walmart shoppers leave and never come back.', 'After they quit shopping at Walmart, both Shelepin and Larsen realized that they could find higher quality products at local or smaller stores. Not only that, but these stores often have unique items that can’t be found elsewhere. As an added bonus, it’s easier to connect on a personal level with local business owners or merchants than it is with a major retailer like Walmart.', '“In my experience, shopping locally has not only provided me with better products but has also given me a sense of purpose and connection to my community,” said Shelepin. “By choosing to shop at smaller, independent stores, I’ve discovered unique and high-quality products while directly contributing to the local economy… It’s been a rewarding experience to connect with local merchants and learn their stories.”', 'Larsen added, “Since I stopped shopping at Walmart, I’ve learned that there are numerous alternatives available that offer high-quality products, better environmental practices and a more pleasant shopping experience.”', 'Resisting the urge to purchase things you don’t need is a major challenge for many shoppers, especially when everything’s all in one convenient place and reasonably priced. For Larsen, leaving Walmart behind helped him realize that he can get by just fine without buying as many things as he once did.', '“I don’t need to buy as much stuff as I thought I did,” Larsen explained. “I used to go to Walmart and buy things I didn’t need, just because they were cheap. But now, I’m more mindful of my spending and I only buy things that I really need.”', 'More From GOBankingRates', 'The Average American Spends This Much on Rent -- See How You Stack Up', ""I'm a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I'm Never Selling"", '3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000', 'How to Earn an Extra $500 a Year on Your Savings', 'This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why I Stopped Shopping at Walmart']"

The global economy continues to recover from the intense impact of COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The US cumulative venture capital investment in AI over the last 10 years was more than double the AI investment in China and almost 10 times that in either the European Union or the UK.', 'The divergence between the United States and the Euro area can be explained on the basis of several factors, the first one being energy prices.

If you want to skip our analysis of the utility industry and the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now. ', 'The utility industry stands to be disrupted the most by the ongoing global shift to renewable energy. Ever since discovering the marvels of internal combustion, humanity has been generating copious amounts of power from fossil fuels. This powers up our industries, houses, schools, and other modern day infrastructure without which modern life would be impossible. At the same time, the excessive reliance on fossil fuels has impacted the environment and raised the stakes for a shift to a future powered by renewable energy.', 'For the utility industry and the broader energy sector as a whole, particularly when it comes to making a plunge to renewables, December 2023 was an important month. This is because as the month kicked off, delegates from more than a hundred countries agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. This is quite a sizeable commitment since it means that thousands of gigawatts of capacity will have to be added by the end of the decade. For the utility sector, if the countries end up taking concrete steps to meet their commitments, then the COP28 energy deal will be the biggest disruptor.', ""The attempt to triple global renewable energy capacity also means that the supply chain for renewable energy power generation equipment will also have to scale up its operations. To understand the importance of a robust supply chain to help the world meet its renewable energy commitments, consider Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ;WTW)'s Renewable Energy Supply Chain Risk Report for 2023. The report polled companies that are involved in renewable energy supply chain and risk management to share that nearly half (44%) of the respondents highlighted supply chain risks as being one of the biggest threats to the renewable energy industry. Another key concern among the firms was economic uncertainty, with high inflation making it difficult for key component makers to profitably operate their businesses."", 'Shifting gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen utility stocks come under pressure as global financial conditions are significantly different than the environment before the coronavirus pandemic. Utility stocks are typically considered safe haven investments that attract capital when the economic future is unclear. This is because unlike firms, say as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose products depend on discretionary spending power, the utility industry knows that the demand for its products is always there because of the indispensable need for energy. As a result, if investors perceive that the economic outlook is improving and the chances of a recession are low, then money flows out of utility stocks and into high risk stock market sectors.', ""Their stable business model and earnings also means that utility stocks are dividend paying securities. Their dividends introduce another component to their valuations, i.e. the dividend yield. A stock's dividend yield is the dividend payout divided by the share price, and it influences investor decisions to buy the shares. Right now, interest rates are at record highs, and this has led to the utility sector coming under pressure on the market since higher rates mean money flows into stable markets and away from stocks. For instance, consider the Utilities Select Sector SPDR - an exchange traded fund (ETF) made of 30 stocks. The ETF is down 9.2% year to date, to reflect the shifting sentiment around global economic prospects."", ""Diving deeper, we also took a look at the 15 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023 to see which utility stocks were the biggest losers on the stock market as of August 2023. Within this list, the three worst performers were Via Renewables, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIA), Heliogen, Inc. (NYSE:HLGN), and Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ:HTOO).

Inflection is also developing large language models that compete with OpenAI’s GPT series of models, which power Microsoft’s Copilots. Hoffman also joined the board of Greylock investment Tome AI during its 2021 seed round; Tome makes a presentation tool that competes with Microsoft’s venerable PowerPoint.', 'Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) general partner Marc Andreessen sits on Meta’s board, but his venture firm has participated in investment rounds worth hundreds of millions in OpenAI, Mistral AI, and chatbot maker Character AI, all of which compete with Meta’s AI efforts. Meanwhile, the venerable VC firm Kleiner Perkins is an investor in generative AI cloud platform Together AI, which competes with Google Cloud—despite the fact that Kleiner Perkins chair John Doerr sits on the board of Google parent Alphabet.', '“Every one of these directors has to make a decision on which of these enterprises is a priority and give the other seat to someone who can be independent and objective,” said corporate governance veteran Nell Minow, the vice chair at ValueEdge Advisors.', '“You cannot compete with the company on whose board you sit,” agreed Charles Elson, the founding director of the University of Delaware’s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “The greater the potential competition, the more the argument that you have to leave one or the other.”', 'Unlike Hoffman at Greylock, Inflection or Tome, or Andreessen at a16z, Doerr has a relatively hands-off role at Kleiner Perkins; he stepped back from involvement in new investments more than seven years ago. But the legendary Valley investor is still chair—Alphabet took care to flag up Kleiner Perkins’ co-investment in medical imaging company Viz.ai alongside Google Ventures in its 2023 proxy statement, because of Doerr’s roles at both companies.', '“He is still paid by [Kleiner Perkins and is] their fiduciary,” said Elson.', ""While the conflicts presented by Hoffman, Andreessen and Doerr may flout corporate governance principles, they aren't illegal. U.S. antitrust law (specifically, Section 8 of the Clayton Act) only forbids interlocking directorates that involve publicly-traded corporations, not startups like Inflection AI and OpenAI. When former Google CEO and Chair Eric Schmidt was on Apple's board, the overlapping roles at two public companies became a problem when they began to compete in the smartphone business, forcing Schmidt to resign from Apple's board in 2009. When only one company is publicly listed, however, the rules don't apply."", 'In practice, conflicts of interest often aren’t fatal to board membership, says Douglas Chia, a senior fellow at the\xa0Center for Corporate Law and Governance at Rutgers Law School.', '“For boards, usually the protocol is that you disclose the conflict, it’s identified, and the board can then decide what it wants to do,” Chia said. “One option is having the person agree to step off the board or disengage from the other company, but usually they say: ‘Alright, you can do both and if there’s a point in time in the boardroom when the conflict really comes into play, then you recuse yourself. You step out of the room for the discussion; you don’t get to vote on anything relating to that matter or company.’ … But on the other hand, people would say that you still have all this information so you have to leave the board, otherwise you’re privy to too much confidential information for both companies.”', '“These are significant conflicts that are unlikely to be mitigated with recusal from particular briefings or votes,” says Minow. “AI issues concern every aspect of operations and strategy.”', 'There are different kinds of potential conflict of interest that boards have to consider. A particularly sensitive variety, which companies disclose to their shareholders under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, involves situations where the company makes significant transactions with another firm in which one of its board members is involved.', 'Hoffman notably resigned from the OpenAI nonprofit board in March, because he wanted to invest in companies that use OpenAI’s technology. (In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, he also referred to his founding of Inflection AI, which was incubated at Greylock.)', 'Adam D’Angelo, the only OpenAI board member to survive the recent leadership turmoil at the company, is the CEO of Quora, which has a product called Poe that acts as an interface with various chatbots that are based on AI models including OpenAI’s ChatGPT. “Adam has always been very clear with me and the Board about the potential conflict and doing whatever he needed to do (recusing himself when appropriate and even offering to leave the Board if we ever thought it was necessary) to appropriately manage this situation and to avoid conflicted decision-making,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in an X post at the end of November.', 'In the proxy statements through which publicly traded companies inform shareholders and regulators about their directors’ fitness for duty, there are often references to situations involving transactions. For example, Meta’s 2023 proxy statement, issued in April, flagged Andreessen’s interests in crypto exchange Coinbase and virtual-reality fitness firm Within via a16z. Coinbase purchased advertising from Meta, and Meta bought Within, but the Facebook parent advised its shareholders that neither relationship interfered with Andreessen’s independent judgement as a board director (the filing did not specify whether Andreessen recused himself on votes and discussions related to the acquisition of Within, a company in which Andreessen had less than 3% equity).', 'However, these documents don’t refer to competitive conflicts because, in the U.S., they don’t have to. “Proxy statements are very much written in accordance with what is required by the SEC. The first question on any disclosure issue is what do the rules require?” said David Berger, a veteran Silicon Valley lawyer who is a partner at Wilson Sonsini.', 'Ignoring competitive conflicts of interest “will only create greater problems for all parties,” suggested Elson, because “at some point [they’ll get] in trouble with the shareholders.” But, as Chia noted: “It’s very rare that someone is going to get voted out. That accountability mechanism, while it exists in theory, usually does not hold anybody accountable.”', '“This is not an issue generally that is top of mind for shareholders,” concurred Berger.', 'There are other risks to consider, particularly in situations where the corporation ends up buying the smaller rival. “If someone doesn’t like a transaction, they’re going to try find whatever they can to unravel the deal,” said Chia. “You do see this type of lawsuit when it comes to mergers and other big transactions, saying: ‘Clearly the people on the board were the ones who stood to benefit, and they were looking out for their own interests rather than the interests of their shareholders.’ You’re not breaking the rules, but you’re exposing yourself to these types of legal situations where people are going to start suing.”', 'But in Silicon Valley, few people seem to care about those risks. (Fortune invited Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Hoffman, Andreessen and Doerr to provide comments for this story, but none did.)', '“California and Silicon Valley often take a different view than much of the rest of the world and believe that the general diffusion of knowledge from one company to another creates tremendous value—for this reason we have strong laws and policies prohibiting noncompete agreements,” said Berger, adding that he spends “a lot of time jumping between New York and Silicon Valley, and the gap of that cultural understanding is enormous.”', ""“Often that’s part of the reason they were invited [onto the board], because they have such deep knowledge about what’s going on in the sector,” Berger said. “Companies have to make a decision: Is the risk … worth losing the benefit of someone who’s so deeply knowledgeable in the industry, and do you have enough faith in the person’s character so that person won't misuse information they’re gaining as a director?”"", '“There’s a different philosophy out there on these sorts of things than you would have in other places,” observed East-coaster Elson, “but from a strict governance standpoint you can’t serve two masters: yourself and the company.”', 'While Berger says Silicon Valley has always benefited from deep interconnection between its companies, he also acknowledges that these conflicts of interest present at least two clear downsides for the tech industry.', '“One is the risk of monopolies; the other is the bubble situation,” he said. “We have super-rich folks who can lose touch with what is going on outside of their world. There are tremendous downsides and issues that may arise, but Silicon Valley’s growth has been fueled in part by this notion that people can be on different boards.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Nor will you find any paracetamol, verruca cream or plasters. Anyone in search of the chain’s popular “meal deal” is destined to leave empty-handed and hungry.', 'Stretching across more than 11,000 sq feet of prime retail space, the shiny new Battersea store is the first Boots shop dedicated solely to everything that Britain’s booming £30bn beauty industry has to offer.', '“Boots Beauty”, as it has been imaginatively called, houses more than 250 of the hippest beauty brands around; hosts beauty “master-classes”; employs a small army of 35 beauty specialists; and offers various services such as a hair bar that can run “scalp analysis”, and an in-house dermatologists providing “skin scan services”.', 'There is a lot riding on its success. The City is abuzz with talk that the US parent company of Boots has revived plans to offload the company, raising the prospect of a multibillion-dollar sale or even a stock market float of one of Britain’s biggest high street names.', 'It comes just weeks after Boots offloaded its £4.8bn pension scheme, removing a major barrier to any deal. “The decks are now clear,” pensions expert John Ralfe says.', 'There is particular excitement about the possibility of Boots returning to public hands after a 15-year hiatus given widespread concerns about the shrinking of the London stock market. The optimistic view from some quarters is that a listing of such a well-known retailer in the capital could provide a desperately needed shot in the arm for UK equities markets, amid fears they have been plunged into an irreversible spiral of decline.', 'But if Boots is to stand any chance of injecting some pizzazz back into UK stocks, management must dispel long standing doubts about its prospects. New ventures like the Battersea beauty emporium will be critical if the company is to convince the sceptics that its best days aren’t long behind it.', 'The chain is plagued by accusations of under-investment. Critics say this is partly a result of having to pay out billions of pounds in dividends after it fell into the hands of private equity house KKR and Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina in 2007.', 'The payments have continued to flow since Boots was swallowed by American pharmacy giant Walgreens in a two-stage deal between 2012 and 2014. Walgreens reportedly helped itself to more than £3bn of payouts from its UK operations in 2022 alone.', 'A decade and a half of indifferent ownership has left it with hundreds of shabby stores, many of which are in the wrong places. Its digital offering has long lagged rivals. A senior Boots executive says until relatively recently some of the management team thought the internet would be “a short-lived fad”.', 'One former director claims Boots has suffered from a lack of investment since as far back as the turn of the millennium. “Now you’ve got a moribund, no-growth business,” he says.', 'The boss of one of its biggest rivals scoffs at reports that Boots is worth as much as £7bn: “There’s no way it’s worth that.”', 'Some say its future is even more uncertain in the face of fierce competition. Analyst Neil Saunders describes Boot as “a solid company” but nothing more than that.', '“It’s not a terrible retailer. It has some good credentials. There are challenges – as there are for all retailers – but it has a fairly solid position in the UK. It’s just not great and it needs to be great in order to thrive in the current market. It faces a lot of pressure from supermarkets, and from Superdrug.”', 'Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, says the competition has increased “massively” since Boots was taken private by the private equity giant KKR in 2007.', '“Twenty years ago, Savers and Home Bargains didn’t exist. Now people who drive Audis and Mercedes are very happy to go and buy their Procter & Gamble and Unilever products at these places – and they’re a lot cheaper,” Black says.', 'The latest threat comes from Sephora, the French beauty and skincare brand that is owned by luxury goods giant LVMH.', '“Sephora is a real problem for Boots if it gets going in the UK,” Black says.', 'Boots boss Seb James has admitted to trying to sabotage the company’s first UK store opening in the Westfield shopping centre in White City, west London. It has plans to open a second store in Westfield Stratford, east London.', 'Boots insiders reject much of the criticism levelled at the company as lazy and outdated. Scores of the most tired shops have been closed and another 300 earmarked for the chop.', 'Money is being ploughed into a core estate of 400 larger stores offering both beauty and healthcare products. Most of these are to be found in town centres or on retail parks that are supplemented by a surrounding network of hundreds of smaller local pharmacies and travel stores.', 'Negotiations described as “aggressive” by some big landlords mean the vast majority of rents are now on short leases, with some landlords agreeing to deals on as little as £1 a year rather than risk shops being vacated.', 'Boots’s online offering is also getting better. Improvements to the speed and security of its website, ease of checkout, payment and search function, along with better processing and delivery times, have boosted online transactions by nearly a quarter over the last year. The Boots app now has 6.4 million active users.', 'Bosses say the collapse of Debenhams has boosted sales despite claims that they were slow to capitalise on its disappearance from the high street. In October, the retailer posted its tenth consecutive quarter of market share gains.', 'Last year, Boots generated pre-tax profits of £137m, up from £44.5m a year before, while turnover climbed 10pc to nearly £7.8bn.', 'Yet the image of Boots as a retailer that has been left behind by rivals will prove hard to shake. There are also expectations that it will return to the public markets still laden with some of the £9bn debt that KKR took out to finance its buyout in 2007.', 'One senior business figure cautions: “If it’s highly indebted, then they’re going to be in great trouble, aren’t they?”', 'Boots representatives insist the business is currently debt-free, though they concede privately that Walgreens may find the opportunity to offload some of its own borrowings onto the balance sheet of its UK subsidiary too hard to resist as it battles its own financial pressures.', 'Concerns about Walgreens’ $12bn (£9.5bn) debt pile prompted Moody’s to downgrade its credit rating by two notches to junk last week. The company’s shaky finances have been further strained by a $7.4bn liability for claims and litigation settlements relating to America’s crippling opioid epidemic.', 'City figures are quick to dismiss misty-eyed suggestions of Boots – reinvigorated or not – as the saviour of UK stocks.', '“London is in a terrible state,” one senior boardroom figure says. “The stock market has got a real problem but it’s not to do with the stock market. It’s to do with pools of capital that are no longer there because pension funds are either unwilling or constrained from buying equities.”', 'Veteran fund manager Richard Buxton says a relisting might provide a short-lived boost but nothing more than that because the reasons for Britain’s shrinking equities markets are so deep-rooted and longstanding.', '“It’s not the answer. People might make a huge ‘whoopee’ and say ‘the markets are alive’ and ‘how wonderful’ but then we need to have a long conversation about what actually needs to be done to revive the stock market,” he says.', '“It involves getting far higher levels of compulsory savings at source going into equities. Companies prefer the US because there is a deep, liquid equity-oriented savings pool. In the UK, we have managed to eviscerate that.”', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The pandemic served to sow a state of panic in investors that has been hard to shake despite a post-pandemic economic boom. Record inflation in 2021 and 2022 led to several rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, further eroding investor appetite for equities. However, as the market stabilizes and yields shrink, analysts predict record growth for stocks in the coming months, as evidenced by the 5.2% acceleration rate for the US economy in the third quarter.\xa0', 'There is ample evidence to support the rock solid nature of the US economy heading into the holiday season. Latest data from the US government shows that nearly 200,000 jobs were added to the economy in November, with unemployment falling to 3.7%.

If you want to skip our analysis of the utility industry and the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now. ', 'The utility industry stands to be disrupted the most by the ongoing global shift to renewable energy. Ever since discovering the marvels of internal combustion, humanity has been generating copious amounts of power from fossil fuels. This powers up our industries, houses, schools, and other modern day infrastructure without which modern life would be impossible. At the same time, the excessive reliance on fossil fuels has impacted the environment and raised the stakes for a shift to a future powered by renewable energy.', 'For the utility industry and the broader energy sector as a whole, particularly when it comes to making a plunge to renewables, December 2023 was an important month. This is because as the month kicked off, delegates from more than a hundred countries agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. This is quite a sizeable commitment since it means that thousands of gigawatts of capacity will have to be added by the end of the decade. For the utility sector, if the countries end up taking concrete steps to meet their commitments, then the COP28 energy deal will be the biggest disruptor.', ""The attempt to triple global renewable energy capacity also means that the supply chain for renewable energy power generation equipment will also have to scale up its operations. To understand the importance of a robust supply chain to help the world meet its renewable energy commitments, consider Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ;WTW)'s Renewable Energy Supply Chain Risk Report for 2023. The report polled companies that are involved in renewable energy supply chain and risk management to share that nearly half (44%) of the respondents highlighted supply chain risks as being one of the biggest threats to the renewable energy industry. Another key concern among the firms was economic uncertainty, with high inflation making it difficult for key component makers to profitably operate their businesses."", 'Shifting gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen utility stocks come under pressure as global financial conditions are significantly different than the environment before the coronavirus pandemic. Utility stocks are typically considered safe haven investments that attract capital when the economic future is unclear. This is because unlike firms, say as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose products depend on discretionary spending power, the utility industry knows that the demand for its products is always there because of the indispensable need for energy. As a result, if investors perceive that the economic outlook is improving and the chances of a recession are low, then money flows out of utility stocks and into high risk stock market sectors.', ""Their stable business model and earnings also means that utility stocks are dividend paying securities. Their dividends introduce another component to their valuations, i.e. the dividend yield. A stock's dividend yield is the dividend payout divided by the share price, and it influences investor decisions to buy the shares. Right now, interest rates are at record highs, and this has led to the utility sector coming under pressure on the market since higher rates mean money flows into stable markets and away from stocks. For instance, consider the Utilities Select Sector SPDR - an exchange traded fund (ETF) made of 30 stocks. The ETF is down 9.2% year to date, to reflect the shifting sentiment around global economic prospects."", ""Diving deeper, we also took a look at the 15 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023 to see which utility stocks were the biggest losers on the stock market as of August 2023. Within this list, the three worst performers were Via Renewables, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIA), Heliogen, Inc. (NYSE:HLGN), and Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ:HTOO).

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MNST.', ""Guy Carling is a seasoned executive with a significant role at Monster Beverage Corp, overseeing the company's operations in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region. His position puts him in charge of a critical segment of Monster Beverage's international market, which is vital for the company's global expansion strategy and revenue growth. Carling's decisions and actions are closely watched by investors, as they can have a substantial impact on the company's performance in these key markets."", 'Monster Beverage Corp is a global leader in the development, marketing, sales, and distribution of energy drink beverages and concentrates.

In the case of Guy Carling, the insider has sold 115,144 shares over the past year without purchasing any shares. This pattern of selling could raise questions among investors about Carling's long-term outlook on the company."", ""However, it's important to consider the broader context of insider transactions at Monster Beverage Corp.

For Mattel, the blockbuster sparked a boom in Barbie toy sales—and helped the toymaker avoid the kind of terrible year that Hasbro and other rivals are having.', 'This week, Hasbro announced it would cut nearly 20% of its staff, or about 1,100 jobs, with CEO Chris Cocks saying that “the market headwinds we anticipated have proven to be stronger and more persistent than planned.”', 'Hasbro, like other toymakers, has been hit hard by a post-pandemic slowdown, which saw parents cut back on toys after loading up on them while staying home. The company’s shares have fallen nearly 20% this year, and analysts expect its sales to decline by 19% this quarter—a crucial one given holiday toy shopping.', 'The tough industry conditions have been felt less acutely by Mattel, thanks to Barbie. The movie boosted sales of dolls, accessories, and Dreamhouses, helping the company beat Wall Street’s estimates with a 9% increase in third-quarter sales.', 'As for this key quarter, “the success of the movie will be an important contributor” to holiday results, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told the Wall Street Journal in October. “The movie opened the aperture for Barbie. Barbie now appeals for more fans, a broader demographic.”', 'The company did endure the industry headwinds in other categories, however, with its games, actions figures, and building sets all seeing sales declines.', 'Movies based on toys are nothing new, of course, but the slowdown and huge success of Barbie means many more such films will follow, even for ideas that have been stalled or in a state of partial development for years. Mattel, which sees Barbie as a template, announced earlier this year upcoming movies based on UNO, Hot Wheels, Magic 8 Ball, Polly Pocket, and Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots.

I am so excited to tell a story that tackles the issues of girlhood in a real and compelling way.”', 'If that sounds like a stretch, consider Barbie. It’s “a story about humanity—we elevated Barbie beyond a doll to an idea,” Lisa McKnight, executive vice president and chief brand officer of Mattel, told Fortune.', '“It’s not about selling toys, it’s about telling the best stories,” added Robbie Brenner, president of Mattel Films. “If you’re not making something that feels out of the box and different and sticky, then you have no business making content.”', 'Time will tell if Mattel has hit upon a winning formula or if moviegoers will quickly tire of toy-centric flicks, however good the stories.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

When the stock fell off a very steep cliff in late 2021 and early 2022, the company’s growth prospects were questioned. With Squid Game: The Challenge reality series leaning on the strength of its impressive Squid Game franchise and new plans for its video game business, it’s hard not to feel better about the company’s growth story moving into 2024.', 'Sure, Netflix stock’s 2021-22 crash was rather painful. It’s still quite unheard of to learn of a FAANG stock shedding more than 70% of its value in a matter of months! As it turned out, the stock went from being absurdly overvalued to absurdly undervalued. Today, after marching about 190% since its 2022 lows, the stock more or less looks to be close to a fair valuation.', 'At writing, shares trade at 29.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) — or 48.0 times trailing earnings — a multiple that reflects robust growth, but it’s not the hyper-growth multiple it once commanded. Of course, a forward P/E of around 30 times doesn’t exactly scream cheap. However, if Netflix can prove to the world it has game (pardon the pun), I do not doubt the firm’s abilities to continue surging into the new year, perhaps on the back of more valuation multiple expansion.', 'Under the leadership of its new CEO, Greg Peters, who’s done a solid job at the helm in his first year, I do think Netflix’s gaming expedition will prove worthwhile. As such, I’m staying bullish on Netflix stock, as are many analysts, with shares going for just north of $470 per share.', 'Squid Game is more than just a hot show; it seems to be a robust franchise that’s paved the way for an impressive reality series. Reportedly, the premiere of Squid Game: The Challenge drew in 1.1 million viewers in the U.S. The reality series, which, apart from being filmed in a massive former aircraft hangar in the U.K., has plenty of U.K.-based contestants, is also a hit in the U.K. market.', 'After having binge-watched the entire series, I must say that I’m convinced the Squid Game brand has grown into something special, perhaps a cash cow for Netflix. Like the original Squid Game show, The Challenge is slated for another season, and it’s open to taking in new applications for its second season. Who wouldn’t want to be a contestant on the show and have a shot at the $4.56 million? It’s the biggest prize in reality TV history — one that probably won’t be topped anytime soon.', 'Looking ahead, Netflix viewers eagerly await the second seasons of Squid Game and Squid Game: The Challenge. Additionally, a video game within the Squid Game universe is also on the horizon. My guess is that it’ll be a hit, too.', 'At this juncture, I view Squid Games as one of the critical components of Netflix’s moat. While we’ve witnessed a slew of competitors in streaming step forward in recent years, it’s been absolutely remarkable that Netflix has been able to stay top dog. Moving forward, I think it can still stay a leader as its rivals look to team up to offer bundles and better value for prospective customers.', 'Indeed, Paramount (NASDAQ:PARA) made headlines for chatter over a potential bundle deal with the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has its own Apple TV+ service. The deal could help the two streaming underdogs get a nice edge in the streaming space. But don’t look for any such partnership to dethrone Netflix — not while it continues to deliver much-watched content at a respectable rate.', 'On the bundling front, Netflix is throwing in its gaming offerings to keep subscribers subscribed. Until now, games haven’t been a massive draw for the company. However, in 2024, games may be what keeps Netflix as one of the stickiest subscriptions in streaming.', 'The company offers a slew of mobile and cloud games that users can play on their TVs. Such games are relatively small games that aren’t drawing in hardcore gamers and fans of triple-A titles. This is bound to change. Netflix not only has close to 90 games in the works, but it is also bringing one of the biggest game franchises to its platform: Grand Theft Auto (GTA) Trilogy, and it won’t cost subscribers extra to access the gaming content.', 'I view the aggressive gaming move as a genius one. As gamers await GTA VI, which recently dropped its much-awaited trailer and release year (2025), I’ll bet that many will want to revisit the classic titles in the GTA franchise in 2024.', 'On TipRanks, Netflix stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 35 analyst ratings, there are 24 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NFLX stock price target\xa0is $467.93, implying downside potential of 2.5%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $325.00 per share to a high of $600.00 per share.', 'With all the gaming titles and Squid Game content coming, I think Netflix will have no issues raising prices again when the time comes. Netflix isn’t just another streamer. It has a magic formula and a willingness to step outside of its comfort zone in search of greater growth.', 'Disclosure']"

First, there are the shoppers that visit TJX stores, and similar retailers, looking to stretch their budgets as far as possible. Then, there's another group that's usually better off financially that goes for the thrill of finding a diamond in the rough, so to speak. Together, these shoppers have been more than enough to keep TJX growing steadily over the years as you can see below (aside from the coronavirus pandemic)."", 'The retailer continues to expand its footprint with 50 locations added in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, bringing the total number of stores up to 4,934.

The problem is that investors appear to have already factored that into the stock price.', ""If you own TJX already, you should be happy with the latest results.

Due to its need to consistently raise or refinance its capital, NextEra Partners is extremely sensitive to interest rates, so the summer's sharp rise in long-term rates caused the stock to crash."", 'But on Wednesday of this week, the Federal Reserve appeared to pivot its posture from a focus on how high to raise rates and toward when to cut them. That led to a relief rally in rate-sensitive stocks, including NextEra.', ""At this week's Fed meeting, the Fed left the federal funds rate unchanged. Following that meeting and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, 10-year Treasury bond yields fell sharply, reaching 3.93% by the end of trading Friday. That's in comparison to 4.27% to start the week and a recent multiyear peak of 4.99% in October."", 'Perhaps the most consequential part of the meeting was the Fed\'s ""dot plot"" for rate expectations going forward, showing three rate cuts in 2024 and another four in 2025. That\'s more cuts than the Fed had previously projected, thereby giving investors incremental confidence that the Fed would ease off its restrictive position soon without needing a recession and job losses to do so.', 'Thus, investors gained more confidence in the ""soft-landing"" scenario.', ""Lower interest rates would definitely be a boon to NextEra Energy Partners, which has to raise capital in order to fund the acquisition of new renewable-energy projects. The stock traded as high as $77 per share early in the year but has since cratered to just $30 despite this week's gains. This has largely been due to the rapid change in interest rates, which rocketed higher throughout the summer before peaking in October."", 'NEP data by YCharts.', 'Because NextEra either has to raise money from the debt markets or sell some of its stock to fund projects, a downward spiral in its stock price could be self-fulfilling. If the price goes low enough, the stock can become too cheap for the company to reasonably sell in order to buy more renewable wind- or solar-energy projects. And without any growth on the horizon, investors will have to take its current run-rate yield as their return.', ""As higher interest rates and a lower stock price emerged this year, management lowered the growth outlook for shareholder distributions in September from 12% to 6% going forward due to tighter financial conditions. But even though management was being honest with shareholders, that appeared to backfire, as NextEra's stock crashed even further, perhaps hampering the company's ability to buy projects at all. Even with this week's gains, shares are still far lower than they were prior to that announcement."", ""However, with the Fed easing off the brakes, the prospect of that rate-headwind trend reversing pushed NextEra's stock higher this week."", 'With the stock around $30, NextEra is well off its recent low of $20 but still well below its 52-week highs and even well below the $48 price right before its September announcement. Thus, it remains to be seen if NextEra will be able to increase its dividend growth going forward.', 'On its recent quarterly-earnings report, management did announce a 6% dividend increase, in line with its new target given in September. New capital for projects will come from the recent sale of its natural gas pipeline assets, as well as some lower-cost repowering of existing wind projects, which will increase their efficiency. But there are only so many of these alternative financing or lower-capex options the company can pursue outside of selling more debt or stock.', ""At its current run rate of about $775 million in cash available for distribution (CAFD), NextEra's stock only trades around 3.6 times CAFD, which is cheap. But keep in mind, NextEra's enterprise value\xa0(EV), including debt, is much higher at around $9 billion, putting its EV-to-CAFD ratio at a more normal-looking 11.6."", ""That 9% or so CAFD yield is still attractive, although not screamingly cheap for a company that might have a hard time growing those payouts without a higher stock price. Thus, NextEra investors are really left with either the current 11% dividend payout or the hope its share price will climb in the future to more palatable levels where management can once again sell stock to fund growth. It's uncertain if and when that time will come, making NextEra shares still a risky proposition."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy Partners wasn't one of them.

The company only has a few hundred customers but deals with complex projects and large contracts, averaging in the several-million-dollar range annually."", 'The company is generating solid growth. Revenue is up 17% to $558 million in the third quarter, and adjusted operating income doubled from the quarter a year ago to $163.3 million, giving the company a 29% adjusted operating margin.', 'Unlike many AI stocks, Palantir is also profitable based on a generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP), as total operating costs have fallen from a year ago. In the third quarter, it reported GAAP operating income of $40 million, up from a loss of $62.2 million. With the help of interest income, GAAP net income reached $71.5 million in the quarter, marking its fourth straight quarter with positive GAAP net income.', 'That achievement prompted CEO Alex Karp to declare, ""Our company is now eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500, a milestone that we have been working toward and knew was within reach.""', ""In order to gain entry into the S&P 500, a company must be headquartered in the U.S. and have a GAAP profit over the last four quarters. In addition, a majority of shares outstanding must be available to the public to buy and sell, and the company must have a market capitalization of at least $14.5 billion, S&P Global's current threshold for large-cap stocks."", ""Indeed, Palantir now meets all those requirements, but to gain entry to the high-profile, broad-market index, it must replace another stock, and the criteria for removal and addition aren't fully clear. Palantir's market cap of $40 billion makes it more valuable than nearly 300 of the 500 stocks on the S&P 500, making a good argument for its inclusion in the index."", 'The S&P 500 changes members periodically. Generally, about 20 new stocks join the index in a year.', ""Stocks typically get a bump of 5% or so when they're added to the S&P 500. That's primarily because index funds that track the broad-market index need to add the stock to their funds when it joins the S&P 500, but it also acts as a stamp of approval from the benchmark index."", 'Other high-profile stocks that have recently joined the S&P 500 are Uber, which gained as much as 6.2% on Dec. 4 when it was added to the S&P 500, and Airbnb, which jumped 7.2% on the news on Sept. 5.', 'For Palantir, gaining admission to the S&P 500 in 2024 could be one of many catalysts to drive the AI stock higher. Management has clearly demonstrated its ability to control costs and grow profits. If the company continues to do that, it will surely join the S&P 500, though that may not come next year.', ""The company's investors will also keep an eye on Palantir's new AI platform and its overall growth rate to see if it's fulfilling its promise of penetrating the massive market for AI-driven data analysis. The stock is expensive today, but if it can ramp up profitability and grow the top line, shares should move higher, especially if it gains S&P 500 admission."", '10 stocks we like better than Palantir TechnologiesWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Compound interest, of course, being the ability to earn interest on your investment, then reinvest that interest at the same rate of return. Given a long enough time period, compounding can lead to absolutely massive gains.', 'For a stock, if a company can reinvest its earnings at a similar high rate of return, that can lead to likewise jaw-dropping outperformance. This of course is the strategy touted by Warren Buffett and especially his late partner, Charlie Munger.', ""But as the miracle of compounding only works over time, that's why it's so important to buy stocks with long-term staying power. Perusing Buffett's current Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio, here are two current holdings primed for strong long-term compounding and stockholder returns."", 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is known as a tech and e-commerce behemoth, but the company is only 30 years old, which is not long in the grand scheme of American corporate life.', 'What gives Amazon staying power? Two things: Its excellent corporate culture, as well as its first-mover competitive advantage in the fields of both e-commerce and cloud computing.', 'Those two industries are difficult and complex to execute, which helps keep competitors at bay and decreases their chances of catching up. But that complexity has also led to some problems in 2022 and the first part of this year. During the pandemic, Amazon doubled the size of its already-giant fulfillment and distribution platform, making it unwieldly to manage. In addition, cloud customers sought to aggressively cut their computing costs after the pandemic as interest rates rose.', 'But in 2023, Amazon has done what always has done in times of adversity. That is, adapt and get stronger.', 'In e-commerce, the company underwent a structural change, reorganizing its U.S. footprint into eight distinct semi-autonomous regions, with analytics predicting the inventory each region would need. That greatly helped to decrease shipping times from the former model, when goods had to be shipped long distances across the country. The result has been a steady improvement in e-commerce profitability this year, and at greater scale.', ""In cloud computing, Amazon Web Services responded to the slowdown by helping customers lower their cloud bills as much as possible, but increasing customer loyalty in the process. That has lowered AWS's growth rate this year, but as CEO Andy Jassy explained on the conference call with analysts, many customers are trading savings for longer-term commitments, with many switching from pay-as-you go contracts to longer-term one-to-three year commitments, trading costs for greater commitment to Amazon's cloud."", 'AWS is also innovating quickly in artificial intelligence. While most of the attention has gone to OpenAI and ChatGPT, owned by Amazon\'s main rival, Amazon\'s platform actually has the widest variety of large language models for customers to use. These include some of Amazon\'s own ""Titan"" models, models from Anthropic, with whom Amazon just invested up to $4 billion, as well as models from other start-ups AI21 Labs, Cohere, Stability AI, and the Llama2 model from Meta Platforms. Given the turmoil we\'ve seen at OpenAI over the past month and the fast pace of innovation across the space, that variety and scale will likely be an advantage for Amazon\'s leading cloud platform going forward.', 'Last quarter was the first since the fourth quarter of 2021 that AWS growth did not decelerate, suggesting the cloud market may be bottoming. And with Amazon having done right by its customers through this downturn, look for AI-fueled growth to pick up in 2024 and beyond.', 'As Amazon is only one of a couple large companies that can afford to compete in its industries, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) is one of only two large global credit and debit card networks serving third party issuers across the world, in over 180 countries. That massive duopoly amid increasing card-based payments adoption has led to incredible outperformance for Mastercard since its IPO in 2006.', 'Even 57 years after its founding and 17 years after its IPO, Mastercard is still finding ways to grow above the level of GDP. Last quarter, revenue grew 14%, or 11% in constant currency. And because Mastercard has relatively stable fixed costs for its giant global card network, a lot of that growth falls straight to its bottom line. As a result, operating income growth came in at 21% in the third quarter.', 'How has Mastercard been able to keep up such growth? Well, the ongoing ""war on cash"" continues even to this day, with a greater and greater percentage of global payments handled by credit and debit accounts on top of Mastercard\'s network ""rails."" This goes not only for customer-to-merchant payments, but also new payment use cases such as business-to-business flows and cross-border payments.', 'In addition, Mastercard has been able to develop new-age fraud detection and cybersecurity intelligence solutions, through both internal development and bolt-on acquisitions. These services help increase payment approvals while limiting fraud, leading to a win-win for customers that buy them. For instance, on its recent conference call, management noted that just one of its security products, SafetyNet, prevented $20 billion in fraud over the past 12 months alone.', ""Last quarter, these value-added services increased by 17%, making up 36% of revenue. And given Mastercard's scale and data advantage, look for these value-added services to get even better in the age of AI, as data-driven insights continue to get more accurate and valuable to businesses worldwide."", 'All in all, Mastercard has an entrenched position that generates high profit growth, with a culture of innovation and long growth runway ahead of it.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

This sale is part of a series of transactions over the past year, where Rogers has sold a total of 46,599 shares and made no purchases. The recent transaction has caught the attention of investors and analysts, prompting a closer look at the implications of insider selling patterns on the stock's performance."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with QCOM.', ""Before delving into the analysis, it's important to understand who Alexander Rogers is within the Qualcomm Inc hierarchy. Rogers has been a key figure in the company, overseeing the QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) division and handling global affairs. His role puts him at the forefront of Qualcomm's licensing operations, which are a significant source of revenue for the company. His insider perspective on the company's performance and prospects makes his trading activities particularly noteworthy."", ""Qualcomm Inc is a leading player in the semiconductor industry, specializing in wireless technology and the development of mobile chipsets. The company's products and services are integral to the operation of mobile devices, networks, and telecommunications systems worldwide. Qualcomm's business model revolves around the design, manufacture, and marketing of digital communication products and services, which has positioned it as a key enabler of the global wireless ecosystem."", ""The relationship between insider trading activities and stock price movements is often scrutinized for insights into company health and management confidence. In the case of Qualcomm, the insider transaction history over the past year shows a lack of insider purchases, with 14 insider sells recorded during the same period. This trend could suggest that insiders, including Rogers, may perceive the stock's current valuation as ripe for realizing gains, or it could reflect a standard diversification of personal investment portfolios."", ""On the day of Rogers's recent sale, Qualcomm shares were trading at $140.5, giving the company a market cap of $159.3 billion. The stock's price-earnings ratio stood at 22.29, which is lower than the industry median of 26.47, indicating a potentially more attractive valuation relative to peers. However, it is higher than Qualcomm's historical median price-earnings ratio, suggesting that the stock may not be as undervalued as it has been in the past."", ""Considering the stock's valuation in relation to the GuruFocus Value (GF Value), Qualcomm Inc appears to be Fairly Valued. The GF Value of $139.65, when compared to the current price of $140.5, results in a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.01. This metric implies that the stock is trading at a price close to what is considered its intrinsic value, based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor for past performance, and future business estimates from analysts."", 'The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus and is calculated using the following factors:', 'Historical multiples such as the price-earnings ratio, price-sales ratio, price-book ratio, and price-to-free cash flow.', ""An adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth."", 'Future business performance estimates provided by Morningstar analysts.', ""When analyzing insider sell trends, it's crucial to consider the broader context. While a series of insider sells could signal caution, it is also common for executives to sell shares for personal financial planning reasons, unrelated to their outlook on the company's future. Moreover, insider sells must be weighed against the overall insider ownership percentage and the company's share repurchase activities, if any."", ""The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the selling pattern over the past year. The absence of insider buys may raise questions, but it is not necessarily indicative of a lack of confidence in the company's prospects. It is also worth noting that insider transactions represent just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to investment decision-making."", ""The GF Value image further illustrates the stock's current valuation in relation to its intrinsic value. Investors often use this information to gauge whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued, which can influence investment decisions."", ""In conclusion, the recent insider sell by Alexander Rogers at Qualcomm Inc warrants attention, but should not be viewed in isolation. Investors should consider the company's valuation, the broader insider trading trends, and other fundamental factors before making any investment decisions. As always, a well-rounded analysis that includes insider activity is a prudent approach to understanding the potential future direction of a stock's price."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

If you want to skip our analysis of the utility industry and the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now. ', 'The utility industry stands to be disrupted the most by the ongoing global shift to renewable energy. Ever since discovering the marvels of internal combustion, humanity has been generating copious amounts of power from fossil fuels. This powers up our industries, houses, schools, and other modern day infrastructure without which modern life would be impossible. At the same time, the excessive reliance on fossil fuels has impacted the environment and raised the stakes for a shift to a future powered by renewable energy.', 'For the utility industry and the broader energy sector as a whole, particularly when it comes to making a plunge to renewables, December 2023 was an important month. This is because as the month kicked off, delegates from more than a hundred countries agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. This is quite a sizeable commitment since it means that thousands of gigawatts of capacity will have to be added by the end of the decade. For the utility sector, if the countries end up taking concrete steps to meet their commitments, then the COP28 energy deal will be the biggest disruptor.', ""The attempt to triple global renewable energy capacity also means that the supply chain for renewable energy power generation equipment will also have to scale up its operations. To understand the importance of a robust supply chain to help the world meet its renewable energy commitments, consider Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ;WTW)'s Renewable Energy Supply Chain Risk Report for 2023. The report polled companies that are involved in renewable energy supply chain and risk management to share that nearly half (44%) of the respondents highlighted supply chain risks as being one of the biggest threats to the renewable energy industry. Another key concern among the firms was economic uncertainty, with high inflation making it difficult for key component makers to profitably operate their businesses."", 'Shifting gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen utility stocks come under pressure as global financial conditions are significantly different than the environment before the coronavirus pandemic. Utility stocks are typically considered safe haven investments that attract capital when the economic future is unclear. This is because unlike firms, say as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose products depend on discretionary spending power, the utility industry knows that the demand for its products is always there because of the indispensable need for energy. As a result, if investors perceive that the economic outlook is improving and the chances of a recession are low, then money flows out of utility stocks and into high risk stock market sectors.', ""Their stable business model and earnings also means that utility stocks are dividend paying securities. Their dividends introduce another component to their valuations, i.e. the dividend yield. A stock's dividend yield is the dividend payout divided by the share price, and it influences investor decisions to buy the shares. Right now, interest rates are at record highs, and this has led to the utility sector coming under pressure on the market since higher rates mean money flows into stable markets and away from stocks. For instance, consider the Utilities Select Sector SPDR - an exchange traded fund (ETF) made of 30 stocks. The ETF is down 9.2% year to date, to reflect the shifting sentiment around global economic prospects."", ""Diving deeper, we also took a look at the 15 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023 to see which utility stocks were the biggest losers on the stock market as of August 2023. Within this list, the three worst performers were Via Renewables, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIA), Heliogen, Inc. (NYSE:HLGN), and Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ:HTOO).

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson ', 'As you can see below, Johnson & Johnson had US$29.9b of debt at October 2023, down from US$32.0b a year prior. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$23.5b, its net debt is less, at about US$6.41b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Johnson & Johnson had liabilities of US$44.4b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$50.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$23.5b in cash and US$14.8b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$56.5b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""Given Johnson & Johnson has a humongous market capitalization of US$373.5b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Johnson & Johnson has a low debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.18. But the really cool thing is that it actually managed to receive more interest than it paid, over the last year. So there's no doubt this company can take on debt while staying cool as a cucumber. Another good sign is that Johnson & Johnson has been able to increase its EBIT by 25% in twelve months, making it easier to pay down debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Johnson & Johnson's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", 'But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Johnson & Johnson recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""Happily, Johnson & Johnson's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its net debt to EBITDA is also very heartening. Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Johnson & Johnson is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Johnson & Johnson , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

If you want to skip our analysis of the utility industry and the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now. ', 'The utility industry stands to be disrupted the most by the ongoing global shift to renewable energy. Ever since discovering the marvels of internal combustion, humanity has been generating copious amounts of power from fossil fuels. This powers up our industries, houses, schools, and other modern day infrastructure without which modern life would be impossible. At the same time, the excessive reliance on fossil fuels has impacted the environment and raised the stakes for a shift to a future powered by renewable energy.', 'For the utility industry and the broader energy sector as a whole, particularly when it comes to making a plunge to renewables, December 2023 was an important month. This is because as the month kicked off, delegates from more than a hundred countries agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. This is quite a sizeable commitment since it means that thousands of gigawatts of capacity will have to be added by the end of the decade. For the utility sector, if the countries end up taking concrete steps to meet their commitments, then the COP28 energy deal will be the biggest disruptor.', ""The attempt to triple global renewable energy capacity also means that the supply chain for renewable energy power generation equipment will also have to scale up its operations. To understand the importance of a robust supply chain to help the world meet its renewable energy commitments, consider Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ;WTW)'s Renewable Energy Supply Chain Risk Report for 2023. The report polled companies that are involved in renewable energy supply chain and risk management to share that nearly half (44%) of the respondents highlighted supply chain risks as being one of the biggest threats to the renewable energy industry. Another key concern among the firms was economic uncertainty, with high inflation making it difficult for key component makers to profitably operate their businesses."", 'Shifting gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen utility stocks come under pressure as global financial conditions are significantly different than the environment before the coronavirus pandemic. Utility stocks are typically considered safe haven investments that attract capital when the economic future is unclear. This is because unlike firms, say as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose products depend on discretionary spending power, the utility industry knows that the demand for its products is always there because of the indispensable need for energy. As a result, if investors perceive that the economic outlook is improving and the chances of a recession are low, then money flows out of utility stocks and into high risk stock market sectors.', ""Their stable business model and earnings also means that utility stocks are dividend paying securities. Their dividends introduce another component to their valuations, i.e. the dividend yield. A stock's dividend yield is the dividend payout divided by the share price, and it influences investor decisions to buy the shares. Right now, interest rates are at record highs, and this has led to the utility sector coming under pressure on the market since higher rates mean money flows into stable markets and away from stocks. For instance, consider the Utilities Select Sector SPDR - an exchange traded fund (ETF) made of 30 stocks. The ETF is down 9.2% year to date, to reflect the shifting sentiment around global economic prospects."", ""Diving deeper, we also took a look at the 15 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023 to see which utility stocks were the biggest losers on the stock market as of August 2023. Within this list, the three worst performers were Via Renewables, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIA), Heliogen, Inc. (NYSE:HLGN), and Fusion Fuel Green PLC (NASDAQ:HTOO).

The AI market alone is projected to skyrocket from $118 billion in 2022 to a phenomenal $300 billion by 2026. With this backdrop, 2023 has unfolded as a pivotal year.

Further elevating its prospects, QCOM is at the forefront of developing AI-enabled chips, poised to revolutionize mobile devices with AI capabilities.', 'Although a dip occurred earlier this year due to sluggish phone sales and a decrease in 5G telecom investment, Qualcomm has rebounded emphatically. And, this resurgence is backed by a solid earnings report, indicating stabilization in its end markets. Looking ahead to 2024, Qualcomm’s venture into AI chips could be a game-changer for the company, offering a lucrative upside for investors.

This conflict leads to a diversification of supply chains, expanding KLAC’s total addressable market (TAM).

But these days, those products are weighing on growth -- and pushing some investors to flee the stock. That's because, as we head toward a post-pandemic world, demand for those blockbusters is on the decline."", ""Earlier this fall, Pfizer sounded the alarm, cutting its forecast for coronavirus product revenue this year and announcing details of a cost-cutting plan. Just this past week, the big pharma released guidance on earnings and coronavirus product revenue for next year that fell short of analysts' expectations. And the company aims to make even deeper cost cuts than initially planned."", 'Pfizer shares responded by dropping to a 10-year low. Considering this latest wave of bad news, should you worry about Pfizer and avoid the shares -- or is it time to buy?', 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""Today's troubles begin with yesterday's successes. Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty and treatment Paxlovid brought in revenue of $37 billion and $18 billion, respectively, at their peak last year. This helped Pfizer post its highest annual revenue ever, more than $100 billion."", ""After such a performance, seeing 2024 annual revenue forecast at a level of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion may be particularly disappointing. And as part of this, Pfizer predicts coronavirus product revenue will total only $8 billion next year, a far cry from last year's figures."", ""On top of that, Pfizer's cost realignment plan will include an additional $500 million in cost cuts to reach cost savings of $4 billion. The company announced this effort earlier in the fall vaccination season, when it noticed lower-than-expected sales of coronavirus products. The idea was to rein in costs to match long-term revenue opportunities. The recent increase in the cost savings forecast may worry investors, as it suggests coronavirus product revenue may be even lower than the company predicted just months ago."", ""All of this may sound grim, but it's important to put the latest news into perspective. With its coronavirus products, Pfizer served a pandemic environment. It's very unlikely demand would remain at the same levels once the world shifted toward a post-pandemic mindset. And it's been difficult for vaccine companies to truly predict vaccine uptake in this evolving situation, other than using demand for influenza vaccines as a guide."", ""These days, coronavirus vaccine coverage hasn't reached 50% of the population, as the flu vaccine has in recent years. But it could eventually, especially if Pfizer and others are successful in producing combined flu-COVID vaccine candidates. Even if coronavirus vaccination doesn't hit the 50% mark, the vaccine still could remain a solid source of recurrent revenue for Pfizer."", ""Meanwhile, other elements also are weighing on Pfizer right now -- but they don't signal negative long-term situations. Pfizer's costs to finance the recent acquisition of oncology company Seagen are set to impact earnings, shaving off 40 cents per share. This is a headwind right now, but the Seagen addition should bring the pharma company a solid portfolio of oncology drugs that will add to revenue over time. Pfizer predicts the Seagen portfolio will start this off by generating $3.1 billion in revenue next year."", ""So what does all of this mean for investors? It's clear Pfizer is going through a time of transition right now, and it may be a tough period for the company and for investors who have watched the shares decline. But the business's long-term prospects remain bright."", 'In addition to the positive points mentioned above, Pfizer also is in the middle of its most aggressive series of product launches ever -- with the goal of bringing 19 new products or indications to market over an 18-month period.', ""Yes, Pfizer faces declining sales from certain products, and the need to bring costs in line with future revenue; these factors could continue weighing on the stock in the near term. I don't see this as a moment to sell the stock or to avoid it, though. Instead, I see it as a time to get in on Pfizer shares for a good price considering its long-term story."", 'Pfizer trades for about 17 times forward earnings estimates, a very reasonable level for this top pharma stock.

One of the best ways to do so is to invest in stocks, and the earlier one starts, the better. Naturally, all stocks aren't created equal, and while some will substantially contribute to making investors millionaires, others might do the opposite."", ""Which of these categories does pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) fall into? Let's find out whether this drugmaker can help investors become part of the seven-figure club."", ""Suppose an investor starts with capital of $100,000 and has 20 years to reach $1 million. This would require a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2%, which isn't easy to pull off. Investors might rightly be skeptical regarding Pfizer's ability to deliver such returns in the next two decades. For one, the company's performance has been catastrophic this year. Also, even in the past 20 years, Pfizer hasn't been able to beat the market -- quite the opposite, in fact."", ""However, if the past isn't a reliable predictor of future success, past failures shouldn't cause investors to conclude that Pfizer will continue to underperform the market over the long run. After all, a lot has happened with the drugmaker lately. CEO Albert Bourla said at the beginning of this year that Pfizer was entering the most crucial 18-month stretch in its (long) history."", ""Bourla was talking about the string of brand-new approvals and important label expansions the company was expecting this year, and so far, things have gone almost exactly as planned. Pfizer has launched seven new products, substantially beating its typical annual number of, at most, two. Pfizer's pipeline is vast and is only getting bigger thanks to acquisitions, including that of cancer expert Seagen."", ""Seagen has nearly 40 cancer-focused programs. This buyout could transform Pfizer into a leader in the field of oncology, especially as it combines its deep pockets with Seagen's proven innovative abilities in this area. The $43 billion Pfizer will pay in cash is possible thanks to its success in the COVID-19 market. So although its sales are declining this year because of a slowdown in vaccinations, the drugmaker is building a solid foundation for the future."", ""Pfizer's work along these lines didn't start with its coronavirus-related efforts. The company significantly altered its operations in the past few years, most notably by shedding some parts of its business that were doing little to contribute to revenue and earnings growth. Pfizer is a much stronger company with better prospects than just three years ago."", ""In my view, Pfizer can deliver somewhat average stock market returns in the next two decades. However, there is something else to consider when looking at a stock's performance, especially over such long periods: dividends. Over the past 20 years, Pfizer's returns with and without dividends (total returns include dividends) are night and day."", ""That's why maintaining a solid dividend program could be an important factor in helping Pfizer turn investors into millionaires in the future. The drugmaker has increased its payouts by just under 58% in the past decade, which is decent. Pfizer's current cash payout ratio of 112% also does not inspire confidence -- it signals that the company's current cash balance isn't enough to cover its dividends. Should investors worry about it? I think the answer is no."", ""Pfizer generated plenty of cash in the past two years thanks to its COVID-19 success, but it spent much of it on acquisitions. Pfizer's management is committed to growing dividends over time. Once the business stabilizes, new products start pulling their weight, and the company stops being severely affected by what transpired in the past two years -- which were highly abnormal -- Pfizer's cash payout ratio should get back to more reasonable levels."", 'In short, Pfizer is still a good dividend stock. Reinvesting the dividend should still be an excellent choice for long-term investors.', ""While it is true that Pfizer has had issues this year, the company still has a lot to offer investors. Demand for innovative therapies will increase in the next two decades as the population ages. The drugmaker's strengthening lineup and pipeline, as well as its commitment to growing its dividend, should lead to much better performance soon. And over the next 20 years, my view is that it has an excellent chance of delivering a CAGR of 12.2% with dividends reinvested."", 'In short, Pfizer can help investors become millionaires.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

Recently, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pounded the table on Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS). Personally, I thought VFS shares belonged more at home in a waste management facility rather than in the open market.', 'However, a nagging thought entered my mind: why would Ives risk his reputation on something so wildly speculative?

Within the past three months, TipRanks reveals that the Street’s experts rate FOX a moderate sell. The assessment breaks down as two holds, one sell and conspicuously, zero buys.', 'To be fair, the average price target stands at $36, implying nearly 32% upside potential. However, the main problem for the media juggernaut centers on an unknown future without conservative firebrand Tucker Carlson. Love him or hate him, Carlson loved rattling the cage. In turn, he developed a loyal audience that appreciated his unwillingness to cave to so-called “woke” ideologies.', 'Now, it’s true that advertisers left the Fox network when Carlson was on air broadcasting his various conservative views. And it’s also true that once Fox ousted him, advertisers began returning. However, the company incurred a noticeable erosion of operating margin for only a marginal increase in revenue in the third quarter.', 'That’s a problem the experts refuse to ignore, making FOX one of the stocks analysts hate.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock', 'As an energy services and delivery company committed to renewable energy proliferation, Avangrid (NYSE:AGR) on paper represents a relevant business.

This assessment breaks down as three holds and two sells.', 'With no one recommending a buy rating, the average price target of $33.40 – a mere 3.4% up from Thursday’s close – makes sense. As awesome as Avangrid is in terms of environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, the numbers ultimately must add up. Unfortunately, the financials present major issues for the Street.', 'Yes, the company continues to expand the top line. However, both the gross margin and especially the operating margin slipped year-over-year in Q3.

Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth.

The stock’s ratio of 13.54x is currently well-below the industry average of 27.36x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Xerox Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market.

After all, what good is a 3% yield if the market is up nearly 20%?"", ""But the value of quality dividend stocks isn't how they perform during a strong market -- it's that they deliver regular quarterly payments no matter what the market is doing. The best dividend-paying companies take it a step further by raising their dividends every year, even during recessions. That way, investors can count on a growing income stream when they need it most."", ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Clorox (NYSE: CLX), and Target (NYSE: TGT) have raised their dividends every year for decades. Here's why each stock is worth buying before the end of the year."", ""Depending on whom you ask, Coca-Cola stock could have a phenomenal or mediocre reputation. The easiest criticism is that Coke is a low-growth, market-underperforming stock that isn't worth owning. But proponents of Coca-Cola will argue that the company's track record of dividend raises and buybacks, as well as its wide moat, make it worth owning."", ""Coke's 10-year chart is certainly disappointing. Its trailing-12-month revenue is actually lower today than it was a decade ago. Meanwhile, net income is up just 26% in 10 years and the stock is up just 43% compared to a 150% gain in the S&P 500. However, the consumer staples sector tends to underperform strong bull markets. Coca-Cola's underperformance isn't so bad when you compare it to the sector instead of the S&P 500."", ""Coke's redeeming quality is its history of dividend raises. Coke is one of the longest-tenured Dividend Kings, having paid and raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years. The dividend has increased by over 50% in the last decade alone. And over the past year, Coke has achieved strong bottom-line growth thanks to price increases, proving its brand's power and ability to combat inflation."", ""Investors who care more about capital preservation than capital appreciation will probably gravitate toward Coke's pros outweighing the cons. The trick is to get the stock at a good price. Coke's 24 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is reasonable relative to the S&P 500. With a 3.1% dividend yield, now is a good time to buy Coke if it aligns with your financial goals."", 'Earlier this fall, Clorox stock underwent a swift and brutal sell-off, largely due to a cyberattack. The stock has recently been recovering is now up 22% from its 52-week low. But zoom out, and the stock is essentially flat year to date.', ""Like Coke, Clorox has a portfolio of strong brands that support stable dividend increases. In addition to the flagship Clorox brand, Clorox owns Burt's Bees, Glad trash bags, Brita water filters, Kingsford charcoal, and more. There's a bit more potential growth with Clorox than with Coke, given the product categories Clorox is in and the fact that Clorox's market capitalization is far smaller than Coke's. But Clorox is still primarily a dividend stock. And the stock is simply not as beaten down as it was during the worst of the cyberattack scare."", 'Still, Clorox is a good value. It features a 3.4% dividend yield. And although its P/E ratio is high right now, it has made meaningful cost cuts and price increases that set the stage for strong bottom-line results once Clorox has fully recovered from the cyberattack.', 'Like Clorox, Target suffered a massive sell-off that saw the stock trade as low as around $103 a share. Since Nov. 1, Target is up 24.9%. But it is still down in 2023 and down over 20% in the last three years.', 'Target has been dealing with inflationary pressures, weak consumer spending on discretionary goods, inventory challenges, and theft. The last few years have been an extremely challenging period for predicting buyer behavior, which has gone from a wave of excitement during the pandemic to more reserved today. High interest rates make borrowing money more expensive and pressure consumers to spend within their means.', 'Unfortunately for Target, that means a potentially subdued holiday season, which is why Target has chosen to keep a lean inventory instead of risking being over-optimistic and then having to implement steep discounts after the holidays just to move products off shelves.', ""Even after the stock's recent partial rebound, it still yields 3.2%. Like Coke, it is a Dividend King with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. Target also has more growth potential than Coke or Clorox. It has done an excellent job leaning into its rewards program, curbside pickup, and e-commerce. Its margins are showing signs of improvement, with last quarter's operating margin coming in at 5.2%, which is a sizable improvement over last year's epic margin collapse."", ""Target certainly isn't out of the woods yet. And it may take a while before it fully recovers. But the stock is still cheap, trading at a 17.4 P/E ratio. That's simply too low for a company with Target's brand power and dividend track record."", 'Coke, Clorox, and Target are three stocks ideally suited for investors whose financial goals include generating a steady stream of passive income. Each stock yields over 3%, which is close to the risk-free 10-year Treasury Rate of 4.2%. Only with stocks, you get the potential reward (and take on the risk) that comes with investing.', 'High-quality dividend stocks like Coke, Clorox, and Target should prove to be a worthwhile investment that blends dividend income and capital gains over time.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

That's not always the case, though. The idea behind passive income is that you barely have to lift a finger for the dollars to flow in."", ""There are plenty of ways to generate passive income. One of the best approaches is to buy stocks that pay attractive dividends. The main catch is that you'll need money to invest upfront. But if you have enough cash, making money can be practically a piece of cake with the right stocks. Investing $123,500 in these three high-yield dividend stocks could make you $10,000 in reliable passive income in 2024."", ""If you take one-third of an initial $123,500 and buy shares of Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC), you should make a little over $4,000 in passive income next year. That's because Ares Capital's dividend yield stands at 9.73%."", ""I think you can safely bank on that dividend payout at least staying at the current level. Ares Capital is organized as a business development company (BDC). Regulations require that BDCs return a minimum of 90% of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Ares Capital's core earnings should allow it to comfortably pay dividends at the current level or higher over the next year."", ""The company also has a good track record when it comes to dividends. Ares Capital's dividend has been either stable or increasing for more than 14 years."", ""There is a risk that Ares Capital's share price could decline so much that it offsets any dividend income you receive in 2024. However, investors might be comforted that the stock has delivered higher total returns than the S&P 500 over the last three-year and five-year periods as well as since Ares Capital's IPO in 2004."", ""You should be in a good position to make another $3,100 or so in passive income in 2024 by investing another one-third of the upfront money in Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD). The midstream energy leader's distribution currently yields 7.55%."", ""There's no need to worry about Enterprise Products Partners reducing its distribution. The company has increased its distribution for 25 consecutive years with a compound annual growth rate of around 7%. That's an impressive streak that Enterprise's management team will almost certainly do their best to extend."", ""The key to paying those attractive distributions regularly is to generate steady cash flow. Enterprise Products Partners' history looks great on this front. During the financial crisis that precipitated the Great Recession, the company's distributable cash flow increased. Even during the oil price collapse from 2014 to 2017 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Enterprise's distributable cash flow declined only moderately."", ""Enterprise Products Partners' fortunes don't hinge on oil and gas prices because of its business model built around pipelines and other midstream assets. However, it's possible that the stock could sink if there's an economic downturn next year. The good news for investors, though, is that the prospects for a solid economy in 2024 appear to be relatively bright with inflation moderating, manageable unemployment levels, and the potential for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve."", ""Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is a great target for the final one-third of the initial $123,500 amount. Thanks to the telecommunications giant's dividend yield of a little over 7%, you could make nearly $2,900 in additional passive income next year. This brings the total passive income produced by investing in Ares Capital, Enterprise Products Partners, and Verizon to roughly $10,000."", ""Admittedly, Verizon has faced some headwinds in recent years. Competition is intense in the wireless industry with the constant threat of customer churn. However, the company's dividend hasn't been in jeopardy. In September 2023, Verizon increased its dividend for the 17th consecutive year."", ""I think that Verizon's dividend is more secure now than it's been in a while.

It went public six years later in 1999 with a market valuation of $625 million. The company is now worth $1.2 trillion, and it has created most of that value on the back of its world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the data center.', 'Investors who bought Nvidia stock at its initial public offering (IPO) and held until now would be sitting on a capital gain of 193,508%. In other words, a mere $520 invested back in 1999 would be worth over $1 million today.', 'Nvidia was founded by a trio of engineers including Jensen Huang, who remains its president and CEO today. Inspired by the rise of personal computers, their goal was to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and media industries. Nvidia released its first graphics chip in 1995 and followed it up with several improved models until 1999.', ""That was the year Nvidia launched the first-ever GPU (graphics processing unit) chip under the GeForce brand. It was 50% more powerful than the company's prior chip, and it laid the groundwork for GeForce to go on and conquer the gaming industry. But Nvidia's attention has since turned to a higher calling."", ""The economy is shifting rapidly toward digitization, and businesses need cost-effective solutions to run their operations online. Thus evolved cloud computing, which involves businesses renting computing power from tech giants who manage centralized data centers. Nvidia's GPUs power an increasing number of those data centers, as they tend to be faster and more energy-efficient than traditional CPU (central processing unit) chips."", ""But the recent uptake in AI technologies is accelerating demand for Nvidia's data center hardware. AI models are developed, trained, and deployed in the cloud, so cloud giants like Microsoft and Amazon are racing to get their hands on Nvidia's data center chips designed specifically for AI workloads."", ""That includes the H100, which can speed up large language models (which power generative AI applications like ChatGPT) by 30 times over the company's previous model. But Nvidia just launched the H200, which will be twice as fast as the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy. That's a game changer for data center operators, because the new chip could drive more revenue while also reducing costs."", 'Nvidia reports revenue under four business units: data center, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.', ""A couple of years ago, the gaming segment was Nvidia's largest driver of revenue. But the explosion in demand for data center chips capable of processing AI workloads -- like the H100 and upcoming H200 -- transformed the composition of the company's top line."", ""Here's how different Nvidia's revenue base looked in the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29), compared to the same period just two years ago:"", 'Segment', '% of Revenue in Q3 Fiscal 2022', '% of Revenue in Q3 Fiscal 2024', 'Data center', '41%', '80%', 'Gaming', '45%', '16%', 'Professional visualization', '8%', '2%', 'Automotive', '2%', '1%', 'Other', '3%', '1%', 'Data source: Nvidia.', ""In fiscal Q3 2024 alone, Nvidia's data center revenue soared by 279% year over year to $14.5 billion. Nvidia expects to bring in $20 billion in revenue across all segments in the fourth quarter (ending Jan. 29), which is far above the $17 billion Wall Street predicted."", ""That will take Nvidia's total revenue to $58.8 billion for fiscal 2024 -- doubling its fiscal 2023 result, which is remarkable for a company of this size. The early forecasts for fiscal 2025 point to another record year for the AI giant."", 'It has come a long way since its first year as a public company, when it generated just $158 million in sales.', ""Nvidia entered 2023 with a share price of $143. It currently trades at $490, so roughly $770 billion of its $1.2 trillion valuation has been created this year alone. To be honest, Nvidia's best gains are in the rearview mirror; it's unlikely $520 invested today will turn into $1 million over the next 24 years the same way it did in the last two dozen years."", ""The larger Nvidia gets, the harder it is to grow quickly. When a new technology like AI gathers steam, most of the company's chip sales occur in the first few years. Eventually, the market will become saturated and there won't be enough new customers to sustain Nvidia's growth."", ""But that doesn't mean this company can't mint new millionaires over the long term. It simply means an investor will have to outlay a larger sum of money to potentially become a millionaire."", ""For example, a $100,000 investment could become $1 million within 20 years if Nvidia can grow its revenue by 12.2% annually, on average. Considering the company is on track to grow its revenue at a compound annual rate of 28% over the last 25 years (including fiscal 2024), it's a relatively comfortable bet even if the AI tailwind eventually moderates."", ""With that said, Huang says there is $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI. Given Nvidia's dominant market position, it still has the potential to deliver above-trend growth for several more years, which could accelerate investors' path into the millionaire's club."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) perfectly positioned it to cash in on a spike in demand for AI chips. Meanwhile, its competitors have yet to catch up."", ""Excitement over AI has seen Nvidia's stock reach record heights this year, a stark contrast from the 50% plunge its share price took in 2022 amid an economic downturn. The company is on a promising growth trajectory, with its stock an attractive option heading into the new year."", 'As a result, now is an excellent time to learn more about this tech giant and potentially invest. So, here are five things to know about Nvidia stock.', 'Over the last 12 months, Nvidia has quite possibly enjoyed its best year in business since its founding 30 years ago. Its stock has skyrocketed 226% since Jan. 1. Meanwhile, the company has delivered quarter after quarter of stellar earnings growth.', 'In the third quarter of 2024 (ending October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year, with operating income up more than 1,600%. The meteoric rise was primarily a result of a 284% increase in data center revenue, representing a spike in AI GPU sales.', 'The company massively profited from AI this year, and the industry is showing no signs of slowing. According to Grand View Research, the AI market hit a value of $137 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual rate of 37% until at least 2030. Nvidia has carved out a powerful role in AI and will likely continue profiting from the sector for years.', ""Nvidia is now a data-center-first company. But long before its expansion in markets like AI and cloud computing, the chipmaker's highest earnings segment was gaming."", ""It was one of the first companies to begin selling GPUs to the consumer market, with the chips quickly becoming popular in the gaming community as gamers used Nvidia's hardware to build powerful gaming PCs."", ""Besides its PC business, Nvidia is the primary chip supplier to Nintendo's Switch console. The portable gaming machine has sold more than 132 million units worldwide and is the third-best-selling console of all time (after Sony's PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo DS)."", 'Like many markets across tech, the video games sector suffered from reductions in consumer spending last year. However, Nvidia posted an 81% year-over-year rise in gaming revenue in the 2024 third quarter, signaling a potential end to market declines.', ""Increased interest in AI this year has led countless tech companies to pivot their businesses toward the high-growth industry. While most firms are focusing on the software side of the market, Nvidia's meteoric rise has motivated many to venture into chip production, some for the first time."", ""While it's not surprising that leading chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are gearing up to challenge Nvidia in AI, companies like Amazon and Microsoft have also announced expansions into hardware."", ""Many of these companies will launch their new chips in 2024 as they attempt to take a bite of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share in AI chips."", ""For now, the biggest threat is likely AMD, which has been the second-biggest name in GPUs for years. AMD will launch what the company describes as its most powerful GPU ever in 2024, designed specially to go head-to-head with Nvidia's offerings."", ""Nvidia's dominance will be challenging to overcome, but prospective investors should be aware of increasing competition on the horizon."", 'Over the last year, the U.S. has introduced new restrictions on the export of high-powered chips to China alongside growing tensions between the two countries. The clampdown has made Nvidia investors slightly uneasy because sales to China make up about 20% of its data center revenue.', 'As in many countries worldwide, demand for AI computing power is soaring in China and represents a crucial growth market for Nvidia. As a result, the chipmaker is working closely with the U.S. to develop chips specifically for the Chinese market that will comply with export regulations and meet demand in the region.', ""It's too soon to know how successful the China-specific chips will be, but it's a situation worth keeping an eye on. The company is expanding quickly in other regions, which could offset at least a portion of potential lost sales, but only time will tell how much."", ""This chart shows Nvidia's earnings could rise close to $24 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45 yields a stock price of $1,080, projecting growth of 125% from its current position over the next two years."", 'Nvidia has immense growth potential, with its stock an attractive buy right now and possibly too good to pass up.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

In other words, it all comes down to the fundamentals and simple investing rules.', 'As legendary value investor Mohnish Pabrai says in his famous book The Dhandho Investor:', '“Simplicity is a very powerful construct. Henry Thoreau recognized this when he said, “Our life is frittered away by detail . . . simplify, simplify.” Einstein also recognized the power of simplicity, and it was the key to his breakthroughs in physics. He noted that the five ascending levels of intellect were, “Smart, Intelligent, Brilliant, Genius, Simple.” For Einstein, simplicity was simply the highest level of intellect. Everything about Warren Buffett’s investment style is simple. It is the thinkers like Einstein and Buffett, who fixate on simplicity, who triumph. The genius behind E=mc2 is its simplicity and elegance. Everything about Dhandho is simple, and therein lies its power. ....The psychological warfare with our brains really gets heated after we buy a stock. The most potent weapon in your arsenal to fight these powerful forces is to buy painfully simple businesses with painfully simple theses for why you’re likely to make a great deal of money and unlikely to lose much.

The launch of OpenAI's famous chatbot ChatGPT also highlighted the role of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in training and deploying large language models (LLMs), which drive generative AI applications like ChatGPT. Subsequently, many enterprises started increasingly adopting generative AI technologies, further spurring demand for the company's AI chips. This has been a catalyst for Nvidia in 2023."", ""Nvidia's share price is up by nearly 219% this year, thanks to its position as a leading GPU provider in the ongoing AI revolution. Can the company continue this pace of share price growth and reach $1,000 per share in 2024? Let's find out."", 'Nvidia has posted stellar financial performance in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending Oct. 29, 2023), with revenues soaring by 206% year over year to $18.1 billion and net income surging by 1,259% year over year to $9.2 billion.', ""The data center segment (which accounted for almost 80% of Nvidia's total revenues) saw revenues jump year over year by 279% to $14.5 billion. Additionally, while the company's gaming segment was grappling with an excessive inventory buildup of GPUs in the past year, it is now showing signs of recovery in line with the overall PC market. In the third quarter, the company's gaming business reported revenues of $2.86 billion, up 81% year over year."", ""Unsurprisingly, the data center business is the biggest near-term opportunity for Nvidia. CEO Jensen Huang expects data centers to spend nearly $1 trillion in the next four years on upgrading general computing to accelerated computing infrastructure -- thereby equipping themselves to handle complex AI workloads. With Nvidia accounting for nearly 91.4% of the enterprise GPU market (in 2021), the company's cutting-edge AI chips (H100 and upcoming H200) are well positioned to leverage this opportunity."", ""Furthermore, the demand for Nvidia's proprietary InfiniBand networking technology has grown fivefold year over year in the third quarter, to enhance scale and performance while training LLMs. At the end of the third quarter, Nvidia has already crossed the $10 billion annualized run rate for its networking solutions."", 'Rather than focusing only on hardware, Nvidia has also made significant strides in its software strategy. The company expects its software, support, and services offerings to rake in around $1 billion in annual revenues in fiscal 2024. Nvidia expects its DGX Cloud service and AI enterprise software to be used extensively to train and deploy LLMs.', ""Nvidia's software-hardware ecosystem has helped it build a highly sticky customer base."", 'As of this writing, Nvidia is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.9, far more than the median semiconductor industry valuation of 2.9. A few analysts also think that the company deserves this premium valuation based on its prowess in accelerated computing, market-leading AI-focused data center offerings, and stellar financial numbers.', ""However, some risks should not be ignored. The recent U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China are a significant challenge for the company. With several small chip players chasing Nvidia's nearly 90% share in the $7 billion Chinese chip market, the company's top line may take a hit in the coming quarters."", ""Nvidia's P/S ratio has also increased in tandem with the share price in 2023. Therefore, with the current valuation assuming near-perfect execution for the company, chances of future multiple expansion amid the current difficult geopolitical environment appear slim."", ""So let's assume that the average P/S ratio reverts to Nvidia's five-year average multiple of 22.58 (which is still quite high) in 2024. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenues to be nearly $90 billion in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 31, 2025). Multiplying these numbers gives us an estimate of Nvidia's market capitalization of $2 trillion in 2024 -- less than double the company's current market capitalization of $1.15 trillion. Assuming that the share count remains constant, we can expect Nvidia's share price to reach around $820 in the best scenarios."", ""Hence, even with highly optimistic back-of-napkin calculations, Nvidia does not seem to reach $1,000 per share in 2024. But that doesn't mean that there is no growth potential in this stock. A bullish price target of over $800 is also impressive -- suggesting an upside of more than 71% in the next 12 months."", 'As such, it makes sense for retail investors to consider buying a small stake in the stock, even at elevated levels.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

However, both the gross margin and especially the operating margin slipped year-over-year in Q3. It’s also conspicuous that since the fiscal year ended 2016, operating margins have fallen consecutively.', 'On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, this metric is now sitting in single-digit territory when it once handily occupied double digits. Given the sustainability concerns, AGR is one of the stocks analysts hate.', 'Source: katjen/Shutterstock.com', 'Perhaps an ironic example of stocks analysts are selling, FactSet Research (NYSE:FDS) is a financial data and software company. It’s an invaluable tool for Wall Street professionals – the very experts who now rate its shares as a moderate sell. Adding insult to injury, not a single one issued a buy recommendation. Instead, the assessment breaks down as five holds and two sells.', 'Even more problematic, the average price target lands at only $429.86, implying almost 3% downside risk. For market observers, what may have stood out (in a bad way) was the company’s quarter ended August 2023. While revenue increased 7.4% YOY, gross margin slipped to 50.79% from 51.54% a year earlier. Also, operating margin declined slightly to 26.29% from 26.74%.', 'True, these represent small differences. However, with the expansion of the top line, you’d like to see margins stabilize, not decline. Also, a recent string of insider sells and no insider buys raises eyebrows. Thus, FDS is one of the stocks analysts hate.', 'Source: viewimage / Shutterstock', 'Personally, Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) pains me because, on a fundamental basis, it makes a great narrative for securities to buy. Sadly, it happens to be one of the stocks analysts are selling. Of course, looking at the charts, that should come as no surprise. Since the beginning of this year, HRL dropped more than 30% in equity value. Specifically, the assessment breaks down as two holds, three sells, and zero buys.', 'Adding to the woes for the American food processing company, the average price target for HRL sits at $30.40. That implies a downside risk of almost 5%. As for the reason, I believe it has to do with the disappointing operational performance. In the quarter ended October 2023, the company incurred a revenue growth loss of around 2.6%.', 'On top of that, gross profit dipped to $514 million from $566 million a year earlier. Also, operating margin came in at 9.31%, down from the nearly 11% the company posted in fiscal Q3 2022. Food companies should benefit as an essential business as consumers trade down from discretionary purchases. However, this business just isn’t getting it done.', 'Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock.com', 'Arguably the riskiest idea on this list of stocks that analysts are selling, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) may jump higher based on short-covering speculation. At least, a possibility of such a circumstance materializing exists. But first, the Street rates BCS a moderate sell; specifically, two analysts in late October both labeled shares a sell. Also, the average price target lands at an appropriately hellish $6.66.', 'That implies a downside risk of 7% from Thursday’s close. What has been driving the red ink – aside from general anxieties of a global recession – is the backing out of a major backer. According to Reuters, Qatar Holding, which is owned by Qatar Investment Authority, moved to sell around $644 million worth of BCS shares earlier this week.', 'Curiously, the sale comes just weeks ahead of Barclays expected fresh strategy announcement. Now, what gives me hesitation is that many institutional investors are selling BCS call options. That opens the door to a possible short-covering panic if BCS goes contrarian.

Frankly, that’s obvious when you consider the year-to-date loss of almost 38%. Unsurprisingly, the experts peg shares a moderate sell, breaking down as two holds and one sell. Also, the average price target comes in at $7.75, implying more than 5% downside risk.', 'Fundamentally, Inveso – which is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in acquiring, financing and managing residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans – stares down trying sector-wide headwinds. With interest rates sky high and companies dealing with post-pandemic dynamics, Invesco’s core sectors suffer from demand erosion.', 'Really, management laid out the problems for IVR shareholders. Per the company’s Q3 disclosure, it identified both higher interest rates and escalating interest rate volatility as severe challenges.

So, it’s no shocker that CBRL ranks among the stocks analysts are selling.', 'Specifically, experts rate shares a moderate sell, breaking down as five holds and three sells. Once again, no analyst decided that Cracker Barrel is worthy of a buy rating. Further, the average price target sits at $68.57, implying more than 7% downside risk. On a financial level, the company draws skepticism for its fading operational performance.', 'Conspicuously, revenue came in at $824 million in the quarter ended October 2023, down 1.9% YOY.

If you want to skip our analysis of the utility industry and the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now. ', 'The utility industry stands to be disrupted the most by the ongoing global shift to renewable energy. Ever since discovering the marvels of internal combustion, humanity has been generating copious amounts of power from fossil fuels. This powers up our industries, houses, schools, and other modern day infrastructure without which modern life would be impossible. At the same time, the excessive reliance on fossil fuels has impacted the environment and raised the stakes for a shift to a future powered by renewable energy.', 'For the utility industry and the broader energy sector as a whole, particularly when it comes to making a plunge to renewables, December 2023 was an important month. This is because as the month kicked off, delegates from more than a hundred countries agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. This is quite a sizeable commitment since it means that thousands of gigawatts of capacity will have to be added by the end of the decade. For the utility sector, if the countries end up taking concrete steps to meet their commitments, then the COP28 energy deal will be the biggest disruptor.', ""The attempt to triple global renewable energy capacity also means that the supply chain for renewable energy power generation equipment will also have to scale up its operations. To understand the importance of a robust supply chain to help the world meet its renewable energy commitments, consider Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ;WTW)'s Renewable Energy Supply Chain Risk Report for 2023. The report polled companies that are involved in renewable energy supply chain and risk management to share that nearly half (44%) of the respondents highlighted supply chain risks as being one of the biggest threats to the renewable energy industry. Another key concern among the firms was economic uncertainty, with high inflation making it difficult for key component makers to profitably operate their businesses."", 'Shifting gears, the tail end of 2023 has seen utility stocks come under pressure as global financial conditions are significantly different than the environment before the coronavirus pandemic. Utility stocks are typically considered safe haven investments that attract capital when the economic future is unclear. This is because unlike firms, say as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose products depend on discretionary spending power, the utility industry knows that the demand for its products is always there because of the indispensable need for energy. As a result, if investors perceive that the economic outlook is improving and the chances of a recession are low, then money flows out of utility stocks and into high risk stock market sectors.', ""Their stable business model and earnings also means that utility stocks are dividend paying securities. Their dividends introduce another component to their valuations, i.e. the dividend yield. A stock's dividend yield is the dividend payout divided by the share price, and it influences investor decisions to buy the shares. Right now, interest rates are at record highs, and this has led to the utility sector coming under pressure on the market since higher rates mean money flows into stable markets and away from stocks. For instance, consider the Utilities Select Sector SPDR - an exchange traded fund (ETF) made of 30 stocks. The ETF is down 9.2% year to date, to reflect the shifting sentiment around global economic prospects."", ""Diving deeper, we also took a look at the 15 Worst Performing Utility Stocks in 2023 to see which utility stocks were the biggest losers on the stock market as of August 2023.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$10.4b', 'US$12.1b', 'US$15.1b', 'US$16.8b', 'US$18.2b', 'US$19.4b', 'US$20.4b', 'US$21.3b', 'US$22.1b', 'US$22.8b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x14', 'Analyst x15', 'Analyst x10', 'Est @ 11.11%', 'Est @ 8.44%', 'Est @ 6.58%', 'Est @ 5.27%', 'Est @ 4.35%', 'Est @ 3.71%', 'Est @ 3.27%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% ', 'US$9.6k', 'US$10.4k', 'US$12.0k', 'US$12.3k', 'US$12.4k', 'US$12.2k', 'US$11.9k', 'US$11.5k', 'US$11.1k', 'US$10.6k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$114b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.154. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The availability of such vast land in these cities is an advantage for industries requiring substantial space, such as manufacturing, logistics, and renewable energy projects.', 'However, the benefits of these extensive areas often come with logistical challenges, especially in densely populated cities.

Since one can't know which ones those will be, the best bet is to diversify, which mitigates the risks. Overall, this growth mix succeeded and beat the market by a wide margin."", ""Just 10 stocks aren't quite enough to add up to a fully diversified portfolio.

Chipotle has been one of 2023's biggest gainers, and it's still a fabulous forever stock. I think Dutch Bros has a fantastic long-term opportunity, but it's dealing with macro headwinds that are challenging its operations right now, making it riskier than my current top picks.

The therapy, called Casgevy, is a functional cure for SCD for most patients, and it's also the company's first product to reach the market."", ""With those two major thresholds cleared, under normal circumstances the stock would be flying. But from Dec. 7, a day before the approval, to Dec. 12, CRISPR's shares fell by 16%. One of the company's main competitors, Bluebird Bio, also got its gene therapy for SCD approved on the same day, and its shares are taking an even harsher punishment, falling by 36%. To complicate matters further, shares of Vertex tracked the market's flat performance in the same period."", ""So what's going on?"", 'Before Casgevy, CRISPR Therapeutics had no sources of sales revenue, subsisting on its collaboration revenue and milestone payments. Now, it can start the arduous process of treating patients and capturing reimbursement for the first time, but investors should take care not to expect any quick riches.', ""In terms of Casgevy's addressable market, Vertex assumes that there are roughly 32,000 eligible patients with severe sickle cell disease in the U.S. and Europe. The therapy is intended for one-time dosing, and it appears to be a functional cure for roughly 94% of patients. Patients will need to pay roughly $2 million to get treatment, likely with the help of insurance; as high as this price tag may sound, it's important to note that Bluebird's therapy will cost more than $3 million, so it could face additional barriers to adoption."", ""By 2028, Wall Street analysts are anticipating that sales of Casgevy will be somewhere in the ballpark of $1.2 billion annually. That compares quite favorably to CRISPR's trailing-12-month collaboration revenue of $170 million."", ""Per the terms of the collaboration agreement, Vertex will pay $200 million to CRISPR Therapeutics as the relevant milestone of regulatory approval is now in the rearview mirror. Vertex will also be registering all of Casgevy's revenue and related costs on its financial statements, except for further research and development (R&D) expenses, for which it will pay just 60%."", ""CRISPR will still pick up 40% of the profits or losses, which will be considered part of the cost of goods sold (COGS) expenses paid by Vertex. That profit split somewhat helps to explain the market's dour reaction to the approval, as the full benefit of the launch won't accrue to the smaller business."", ""At the moment, the biotech isn't profitable, and per the average calculations of Wall Street analysts, CRISPR won't be profitable within the next two fiscal years. Therefore, investors appear to be offloading their shares in acknowledgement that growth will be fairly slow to arrive even though regulators opted not to attach any additional strings to Casgevy's approval."", ""On March 30, 2024, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics will hear back from regulators regarding whether Casgevy can be used to treat or cure beta thalassemia, another rare blood disorder. If they get approval, it'll mark the full success of the first part of their joint vision for the candidate. As Casgevy is already approved for both indications in the U.K. since November, there is a high chance the FDA will give them another thumbs up."", ""The next part of the roadmap will be to work on expanding the patient populations that are eligible for treatment with the therapy. With a significant amount of additional R&D work over the coming years, management thinks that it might be possible to treat as many as 450,000 patients total. That'd mark a gargantuan expansion of the medicine's addressable market, and it'd also imply many billions of additional revenue. For now, that large market is a distant dream."", ""If you're thinking of buying this stock, be aware that its peculiar behavior after the approval is not a bullish factor. It's unclear if the market will react to news of the potential future approval for beta thalassemia with similar distaste.

After all, what good is a 3% yield if the market is up nearly 20%?"", ""But the value of quality dividend stocks isn't how they perform during a strong market -- it's that they deliver regular quarterly payments no matter what the market is doing. The best dividend-paying companies take it a step further by raising their dividends every year, even during recessions. That way, investors can count on a growing income stream when they need it most."", ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Clorox (NYSE: CLX), and Target (NYSE: TGT) have raised their dividends every year for decades. Here's why each stock is worth buying before the end of the year."", ""Depending on whom you ask, Coca-Cola stock could have a phenomenal or mediocre reputation. The easiest criticism is that Coke is a low-growth, market-underperforming stock that isn't worth owning. But proponents of Coca-Cola will argue that the company's track record of dividend raises and buybacks, as well as its wide moat, make it worth owning."", ""Coke's 10-year chart is certainly disappointing. Its trailing-12-month revenue is actually lower today than it was a decade ago. Meanwhile, net income is up just 26% in 10 years and the stock is up just 43% compared to a 150% gain in the S&P 500. However, the consumer staples sector tends to underperform strong bull markets. Coca-Cola's underperformance isn't so bad when you compare it to the sector instead of the S&P 500."", ""Coke's redeeming quality is its history of dividend raises. Coke is one of the longest-tenured Dividend Kings, having paid and raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years. The dividend has increased by over 50% in the last decade alone. And over the past year, Coke has achieved strong bottom-line growth thanks to price increases, proving its brand's power and ability to combat inflation."", ""Investors who care more about capital preservation than capital appreciation will probably gravitate toward Coke's pros outweighing the cons. The trick is to get the stock at a good price. Coke's 24 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is reasonable relative to the S&P 500. With a 3.1% dividend yield, now is a good time to buy Coke if it aligns with your financial goals."", 'Earlier this fall, Clorox stock underwent a swift and brutal sell-off, largely due to a cyberattack. The stock has recently been recovering is now up 22% from its 52-week low. But zoom out, and the stock is essentially flat year to date.', ""Like Coke, Clorox has a portfolio of strong brands that support stable dividend increases. In addition to the flagship Clorox brand, Clorox owns Burt's Bees, Glad trash bags, Brita water filters, Kingsford charcoal, and more. There's a bit more potential growth with Clorox than with Coke, given the product categories Clorox is in and the fact that Clorox's market capitalization is far smaller than Coke's. But Clorox is still primarily a dividend stock. And the stock is simply not as beaten down as it was during the worst of the cyberattack scare."", 'Still, Clorox is a good value. It features a 3.4% dividend yield. And although its P/E ratio is high right now, it has made meaningful cost cuts and price increases that set the stage for strong bottom-line results once Clorox has fully recovered from the cyberattack.', 'Like Clorox, Target suffered a massive sell-off that saw the stock trade as low as around $103 a share. Since Nov. 1, Target is up 24.9%. But it is still down in 2023 and down over 20% in the last three years.', 'Target has been dealing with inflationary pressures, weak consumer spending on discretionary goods, inventory challenges, and theft. The last few years have been an extremely challenging period for predicting buyer behavior, which has gone from a wave of excitement during the pandemic to more reserved today. High interest rates make borrowing money more expensive and pressure consumers to spend within their means.', 'Unfortunately for Target, that means a potentially subdued holiday season, which is why Target has chosen to keep a lean inventory instead of risking being over-optimistic and then having to implement steep discounts after the holidays just to move products off shelves.', ""Even after the stock's recent partial rebound, it still yields 3.2%. Like Coke, it is a Dividend King with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. Target also has more growth potential than Coke or Clorox. It has done an excellent job leaning into its rewards program, curbside pickup, and e-commerce. Its margins are showing signs of improvement, with last quarter's operating margin coming in at 5.2%, which is a sizable improvement over last year's epic margin collapse."", ""Target certainly isn't out of the woods yet. And it may take a while before it fully recovers. But the stock is still cheap, trading at a 17.4 P/E ratio. That's simply too low for a company with Target's brand power and dividend track record."", 'Coke, Clorox, and Target are three stocks ideally suited for investors whose financial goals include generating a steady stream of passive income. Each stock yields over 3%, which is close to the risk-free 10-year Treasury Rate of 4.2%. Only with stocks, you get the potential reward (and take on the risk) that comes with investing.', 'High-quality dividend stocks like Coke, Clorox, and Target should prove to be a worthwhile investment that blends dividend income and capital gains over time.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Stryker as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.952. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 4 Best Cobalt Stocks to Buy Now.', 'There has been a massive rise in demand for electric vehicles over the past few years. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the share of electric car sales in total car sales has more than tripled since 2020, jumping from 4% to above 12% at the end of last year. This shift towards electric vehicles, as well as an emerging reliance on energy storage systems that power homes, has resulted in an increased demand for cobalt, one of the most sought-after transition metals in the world used to develop batteries.\xa0', 'Even though the electric vehicle revolution has been more than a decade in the making, the cobalt supply chain has not grown with it. Firstly, there is the issue of sustainability. Per price reporting agency Fast Markets, EVs have been the primary consumer of cobalt since 2021. Due to volatile pricing though, EV firms have started using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) in battery manufacturing, decreasing their reliance on cobalt. However, due to properties relating to thermal stability and higher energy density, cobalt remains a battery tech behemoth.\xa0', 'In 2022, cobalt demand grew by more than 33% year-on-year, mainly because of a rise in EV demand. In the next ten years, the demand for the metal will register a compound annual growth rate of more than 14%. The growth of the cobalt market has also been held in check because of geographic monopolies. For example, nearly 70% of mined cobalt, used in EV batteries around the world, comes from the African nation of Congo. A conflict in the region has made cobalt prices more volatile in the past few months.\xa0', 'Indonesia is scaling up cobalt mining to merge as a competitor to Congo. By the end of 2033, the Southeast Asian country is expected to contribute towards more than 33% of the total cobalt supply in the world. Besides mining, cobalt processing is also an important part of the supply chain with a monopoly. 70% of cobalt processing plants in the world are based in China. With the global cobalt recycling market still in infancy, logistical problems and shipping disruptions routinely emerge as major headwinds for the industry.\xa0', 'Even though the United States and Europe are working towards cobalt mining and processing facilities, Fast Markets expects the gap between supply and demand to grow in these regions over the coming years. This will result in a reliance on imports to source the needed cobalt for EV battery manufacturing. Battery recycling plants could mitigate some of these import costs, but their overall impact on the cobalt import bill will be minimal. Cobalt surpluses will keep the cost of the key metal below record highs though, experts predict.\xa0', 'Glencore (LSE:GLEN.L), one of the biggest cobalt mining firms in the world, recently released a report outlining how surging supplies of the metal from Africa and Indonesia will create a large surplus in the next few years, keeping the prices of cobalt in check. The company said it would add to cobalt stockpiles and cut production to support prices. In 2022, global cobalt supplies were estimated at around 200,000 metric tons. The surplus metal last year was only around 10,000 metric tons, according to Glencore.\xa0', 'Cobalt prices had registered record highs in May 2022 but have since dropped more than 65% to around $15 per lb. Macquarie analyst Jim Lennon expects the cobalt surplus to grow from 8,600 metric tons in 2023 to more than 10,400 metric tons in 2025. Lennon predicted that new projects in Congo would add more than 50,000 metric tons to the cobalt supply annually in the coming years, with the Chinese mining projects further adding to these numbers. The switch to LFP batteries in Asia is expected to keep the demand of cobalt in check.\xa0', 'Investors eager to benefit from the thriving cobalt market should consider investing in firms like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), and ATI Inc. (NYSE:ATI). Cobalt is expected to play a key role in energy transition away from fossil fuels and looks set to be a long-term growth driver. Michael Shor, the CEO of Haynes International, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAYN), a prominent cobalt firm, recently said during the fourth quarter earnings call that cobalt headwinds were moderating and prices stabilizing.\xa0', '“Looking at the full fiscal year 2023, we achieved revenue of $590 million with company record revenue shift in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. In addition, we had adjusted gross margins neutral of raw material headwind at 20.7% and net income at $42 million. We talked a lot about this raw material impact, which helped us last year and hurt us this year. Raw material price fluctuations can impact our results more sharply than others in our peer group given our product portfolio being solely high-end nickel and cobalt-based alloys, as reflected in that average selling price of $33 a pound. The raw material impact of falling nickel and cobalt, unfavorably impacted our results by approximately $3.7 million in the fourth quarter.', ""We estimate that the full fiscal year impact was $12.6 million unfavorable. One thing that is interesting is the headwind is mostly cobalt. The breakdown is a cobalt headwind of $8.1 million of the $12.6 million and nickel was $4.5 million of the $12.6 million. Thankfully, the cobalt headwind is moderating as the cobalt price has stabilized. Moreover, nickel is still falling, thus still causing an increasing headwind. As Mike mentioned, this is concerning. And we are now projecting the impact of this headwind in our first quarter of fiscal '24 to be well above the $3.7 million pre-tax we saw in Q4 of FY '23. Looking at the full year FY '23 raw materials and comparing to FY '22, we saw a significant swing. We highlighted last year that we had a positive tailwind for the year of $9.4 million favorable.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'The companies that have interests in the cobalt business were selected for the list and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment.

Recently, Deborah Stahlkopf, the Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), sold 2,578 shares of the company on December 13, 2023. This transaction has caught the attention of the market, considering the position and influence of the insider within the company.', ""Deborah Stahlkopf serves as the EVP and Chief Legal Officer at Cisco Systems Inc. In her role, she is responsible for overseeing the legal aspects of the company's operations, including compliance, intellectual property, and various other legal matters that are crucial to Cisco's business. Stahlkopf's decisions and actions are often seen as reflective of her confidence in the company's legal standing and future prospects."", 'Cisco Systems Inc is a multinational technology conglomerate headquartered in San Jose, California.

Cisco is known for its routers, switches, and security products that form the backbone of the internet and communications infrastructure. With a market cap of $202.564 billion, Cisco is a significant player in the tech industry, influencing the direction of networking and cybersecurity solutions worldwide.', ""The recent sale by Deborah Stahlkopf of 2,578 shares is part of a broader pattern of insider activity at Cisco Systems Inc. Over the past year, Stahlkopf has sold a total of 64,490 shares and has not made any purchases. This could be interpreted in several ways; however, without additional context, it is challenging to draw a definitive conclusion about the insider's sentiment towards the company's future.When examining the insider transaction history for Cisco Systems Inc, there have been no insider buys and 37 insider sells over the past year. This trend might suggest that insiders, on balance, are choosing to decrease their holdings, potentially signaling a cautious or bearish outlook."", ""However, it is essential to consider the stock's performance and valuation metrics to understand the potential implications of these insider transactions fully."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of Cisco Systems Inc were trading at $49.18. This price gives the company a price-earnings ratio of 15.06, which is lower than the industry median of 22.87 and also below the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This lower price-earnings ratio could indicate that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers and its historical performance.Furthermore, with a price of $49.18 and a GuruFocus Value of $55.94, Cisco Systems Inc has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.88, suggesting that the stock is modestly undervalued based on its GF Value."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, which takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from analysts.Given this valuation, the insider's decision to sell shares might raise questions among investors. It is possible that the insider believes the current market price does not fully reflect the company's intrinsic value, or there could be personal or strategic reasons for the sale that are not directly related to the company's valuation."", ""The sale of shares by EVP and Chief Legal Officer Deborah Stahlkopf is a notable event for Cisco Systems Inc and its investors. While the insider's actions may suggest a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance, the company's valuation metrics indicate that Cisco may be undervalued. Investors should consider the broader context of the insider's trading history, the company's financial health, and market conditions before making investment decisions.As always, insider trading is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to evaluating a stock's potential.
