If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the struggle of American workers, you may go to 10 Best Cities to Retire on $3,500 a Month.', 'According to retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, the retirement system in the United States of America has left behind the bottom 90% of workers. Unable to support themselves on Social Security benefits and savings, these people often find themselves working into old age. Credit Karma, a financial services firm, reveals that an estimated 27% of people aged 59 or older have no retirement savings at all, further reinforcing the need to work post-retirement to support themselves. These findings are noteworthy considering the Social Security trust fund is all set to be depleted by 2034, resulting in a cut in benefits for the millions of Americans who depend on it.', 'Of the 67 million retirees depending on Social Security, a depleted trust fund implies that each beneficiary ought to receive only 77 cents for every $1 in benefits- with the poorest Americans being affected the most. However, it’s not that Americans don’t want to save for retirement, but rather that they don\'t have an option otherwise. As noted by a retirement survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), a growing number of US workers are finding it hard to save for retirement altogether. As of 2022, 47% of the respondents in the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey revealed that they believed they were ""very likely"" to reach their retirement goals. However, this percentage went down to 37% in a year.', 'The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) accurately captures this phenomenon in what they consider to be a “financial vortex”. Due to this financial vortex, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) warns that workers fail to understand what to prioritize, and this is in turn pushing back their retirement by many years. This is true despite many Americans having improved their level of savings in the past year. However, the complex financial landscape, characterized by competing responsibilities like credit card debt, saving for college, and providing financial support to family members, has disrupted savings strategies. This has resulted in a delay in retirement plans by four or more years for 21% of respondents, according to a Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) retirement report.', '""While retirement sentiment improved over last year, the financial vortex remains a huge problem for many workers and retirees. Its challenges are largely immune to improvement in markets and the economy and will continue to impact new generations of retirement savers”.', '-Chris Ceder, senior retirement strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)', 'While the above scenario may be true for the bottom 90% of American workers, Empower, a financial services company, reveals that more than half of Americans may be in the job market post-retirement and open to work “indefinitely”. This report implies that while a majority of workers do work for the money after retirement, many more do so for reasons such as personal fulfillment \\. Nevertheless, one reality for a large portion of retirees in the US is that they live on fixed incomes. For this reason, they must learn to live on either their social security benefits or an amount that includes their minimal savings. For a certain portion of retirees, this figure is near about $3,500. Having covered lists for the best places to retire on $3,000 a month, best places to retire on $2,000 a month, and even best places to retire on $1,500 a month, let’s see what the best places to retire on $3,500 a month are.', 'Copyright: sepavo / 123RF Stock Photo', 'To compile the list of best cities to retire on $3,500 a month, we updated our previous list of best places to retire on $3,500 a month.

Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve\'s next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC\'s ""The Exchange"" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:', '""Based on his [Powell\'s] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.""', ""According to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on."", 'Apart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as\xa0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present.\xa0 On March 15, CNBC\'s Kristina Partsinevelos joined the ""Halftime Report"" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here\'s what she said:', '""The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA\'s] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We\'ll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD\'s latest chip, then that\'s gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we\'ll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that\'ll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.""', 'These comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops.

Since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an aggregate return of 4,938,103% in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on March 14. For the sake of comparison, this is 146 times greater than the aggregate total return of the S&P 500, including dividends paid, over the same period."", 'Even though the affably named ""Oracle of Omaha"" won\'t be right all the time, his track record suggests he has a knack for finding value that\'s hiding in plain sight. That\'s why investors wait so anxiously for Berkshire Hathaway\'s Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).', 'A 13F is a required filing each quarter for institutional money managers who are overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management. As of March 14, Buffett and his team had $366 billion of invested assets spread across 45 stocks and two index funds.', ""What makes 13Fs valuable is they allow investors to easily see what Wall Street's brightest and most successful money managers have been buying, selling, and holding. These filings can provide valuable insight into what stocks and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors."", ""For example, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs have shown that Warren Buffett and his investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been actively adding to their positions in two energy stocks: Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Though energy stocks have historically not accounted for a sizable percentage of Berkshire's invested assets, the combination of Chevron and Occidental comprise nearly 10% of the aforementioned $366 billion portfolio."", ""Having this much capital put to work in two integrated oil and gas stocks is a pretty clear message that Berkshire Hathaway's brightest minds expect the spot price of oil to remain above historic norms, if not head even higher. Years of capital underinvestment during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight global oil supply, which is helping to lift the spot price of crude."", 'Being able to track the investments Warren Buffett makes has allowed investors to ride his coattails to potentially life-changing returns.', 'However, Berkshire Hathaway\'s 13F isn\'t telling the full story in more ways than one. In addition to Warren Buffett\'s company having a $621 million ""secret"" portfolio, Berkshire Hathaway has also been granted an exemption by the SEC for confidential treatment regarding one or more of its holdings.', ""In other words, Buffett and his team are building a position in one or more companies, and they don't want the cat to be let out of the bag while doing so. Since investors tend to pile into the stocks Buffett and his aides purchase, this confidential treatment allows Berkshire to, presumably, build its stake at a lower cost basis."", 'Berkshire\'s last two quarterly 13Fs have come with this confidential treatment disclosure, which means the Oracle of Omaha and his aides have been purchasing shares of a stock, or multiple stocks, from perhaps July through December. Though I\'ve previously thrown a dart at which mystery stock this might be, new clues point to a very specific company as Warren Buffett\'s ""confidential stock.""', ""While there are genuinely thousands of publicly traded companies that Buffett could, in theory, be putting his money to work in, three clues quickly narrow down the field. First, we can examine how much Berkshire Hathaway spent purchasing equity securities during the third and fourth quarters and compare this figure to the rough value of the stocks purchased during those respective quarters, as listed in Berkshire's 13Fs. In the neighborhood of $5 billion in equity security purchases is unaccounted for on a combined basis over the second-half of 2023."", ""What's interesting about this figure is that Berkshire Hathaway would be required to file with the SEC once it's reached at least a 5% stake in a publicly traded company. Since there's currently no filing, it intimates that the company Buffett and his team are secretly buying has a market cap of $100 billion or more. That eliminates all but 120 publicly traded companies in the U.S."", 'Secondly, Berkshire Hathaway\'s fourth-quarter operating results show that the company\'s cost basis for equity securities held in ""banks, insurance, and finance"" grew by $2.38 billion to $27.14 billion from the September-ended quarter. This cost basis grew despite Buffett and Co. selling stakes in insurers Markel Group and Globe Life. This is something my Foolish colleague Adam Levy pointed out two weeks ago, and all but ensures that Buffett\'s confidential stock hails from the financial sector.', 'There are only 24 stocks with a $100 billion or greater market cap found in the financial sector.', 'The third clue is that Warren Buffett loves a good deal and will stubbornly sit on his hands until he gets one. This means any stock with a relatively high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is off the table. Setting the forward P/E cap at 15 reduces the number of candidates to just 13.', ""Among the 13 remaining financial stocks are a handful of companies Berkshire already owns, including Bank of America, American Express, and Citigroup, as well as companies that were sold within the past few quarters or years, such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo. It's highly unlikely Buffett would reenter JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, or Wells Fargo on a confidential basis, and we'd see buying activity via the 13F if it was the former three stocks Berkshire currently owns."", 'This leaves seven possible choices:', 'Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS)', 'HSBC Holdings', 'Royal Bank of Canada', 'Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (NYSE: MUFG)', 'Toronto Dominion Bank', 'Chubb', 'UBS Group', ""Having followed Buffett's trading activity for so long, I can't recall a time when he's shown much, if any, interest in Canadian banks. Furthermore, while the Oracle of Omaha is willing to go to bat for a reclamation project in the U.S. (e.g., Bank of America in 2011), European banks aren't his cup of tea. This likely eliminates HSBC, UBS, Toronto Dominion, and Royal Bank of Canada from the discussion."", ""To go one step further, Berkshire's investment team just purged its portfolio of Markel and Globe Life, meaning there's probably not a big desire to pile into an internationally based insurer like Chubb."", 'This leaves two companies that meet what Warren Buffett is looking for: Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which is better known as ""MUFG.""', 'Morgan Stanley can\'t be ruled out as Berkshire\'s potential ""secret"" buy. It\'s valued at 12 times forward-year earnings and generates a substantial portion of its sales and profits from the company\'s wealth management division. In theory, wealth management should help insulate Morgan Stanley from inevitable downturns in the U.S. and global economy.', 'But the financial stock that makes the most sense for Buffett and his team to confidentially buy is MUFG.', 'In Warren Buffett\'s recently released annual letter to shareholders, he described the small group of companies he values as core holdings that will be held ""indefinitely."" While Coca-Cola and American Express unsurprisingly made the list, the Oracle of Omaha touted Occidental Petroleum and the five Japanese trading houses -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Sumitomo, and Marubeni -- as companies he\'d never sell. In fact, Buffett has upped his company\'s stake to around 9% in each of these Japanese trading houses. Berkshire\'s investment team have not hidden their belief that Japan\'s economy can outperform over the long run.', ""MUFG is the largest bank by assets in Japan. More importantly, it's trading at a reasonably low forward P/E ratio of less than 12, and is valued modestly below its reported book value. High-quality banks trading below their book value have often been a lure that's attracted Buffett. Comparatively, Morgan Stanley is valued about 60% above its book value."", ""Furthermore, MUFG is actually riding Morgan Stanley's coattails to massive profits since the financial crisis more than 15 years ago. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group purchased $9 billion worth of preferred stock in Morgan Stanley following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This stake in Morgan Stanley has consistently generated between 30% and 40% of MUFG's annual profits in recent years."", 'Why buy Morgan Stanley stock when Buffett can get exposure to Morgan Stanley via Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group at a fraction of the cost? I strongly believe MUFG to be the confidential stock Warren Buffett is buying at Berkshire Hathaway.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group wasn’t one of them.

It will be the first significant tech initial public offering (IPO) of the year and could be an important test for prospective companies looking to go public. It\'ll also be an important barometer for investment banks and could signal an intriguing investing opportunity.', 'Over the past few years, IPOs have become quite scarce as companies grappled with rising interest rates and challenging market conditions. In March 2022, the Federal Reserve began aggressively raising its benchmark interest rate to dampen inflationary pressures that were beginning to emerge. Over the next several months, the benchmark federal funds rate rose 525 basis points, major stock market indexes sold off, and newly listed publicly traded companies struggled especially.', 'This created an unfavorable environment, and companies put their IPO plans on hold until conditions improved. According to consulting firm PwC, the past two years were some of the lowest-volume years for IPOs. After a record year in 2021, when 951 companies went public through IPO, the past two years saw 175 total.', ""Although it was a slow year, there were some big IPOs in 2023. Semiconductor designer Arm Holdings went public in September at a nearly $55 billion valuation. Other big-name IPOs included Instacart ($10 billion valuation), Birkenstock ($7.5 billion), and Kenvue ($41 billion). Reddit's IPO this month will be valued at around $6.5 billion and could be an important test of how receptive markets are to new listings."", 'Investment bankers hope 2024 will be a bounce-back year for IPOs. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) are two investment banks working with Reddit on its IPO and eagerly anticipate what will happen next.', ""Morgan Stanley's investment banking revenue has dropped significantly, down 55% over the past two years. Goldman Sachs has seen a similar drop, with its investment banking revenue falling 56% over two years. These companies have managed to navigate a tough investment banking market through solid trading revenues and wealth management businesses. However, if the appetite for risk returns and IPOs perform well, these stocks could get a big boost."", ""The fact that leading IPO candidates are returning to the market is positive, showing that companies finally believe they can once again leap into public ownership. The Federal Reserve's putting a pause on interest rate hikes is another positive development. Year-over-year inflation readings have retreated from their high levels in 2022, and many are hopeful that the Fed will achieve a soft landing, bringing down inflation without inducing too much pain on the economy."", 'Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are two large investment banks in the U.S. that could be intriguing investment opportunities. Both stocks trade around a price-to-earnings ratio of 17. However, for cyclical stocks, these higher valuations are due to these companies experiencing an earnings slump. In comparison, the investment banks were seemingly cheap in 2021, but that was more due to the surge in earnings that turned out to be a value trap.', ""Based on their one-year-forward projected earnings, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are priced at 12.2 and 10 times forward earnings, respectively. Both businesses have navigated a challenging environment for investment banking, and with Reddit's IPO on the way, now could be an excellent time to scoop up these investment banks while they're still cheap."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Morgan Stanley right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Morgan Stanley, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Morgan Stanley wasn’t one of them.

Interest rates had jumped to record highs in the past two years because of rising prices as a result of post-pandemic demand pressures. According to estimates by the International Monetary Fund, global inflation is expected to drop to 5.2% in 2024, from a high of 8.7% in 2022. The world economy will likely grow by 3% this year, the fund forecasts.\xa0', 'Projections by the Federal Reserve indicate that the federal funds rate in the United States is expected to remain high at or above 550 basis points in the early part of 2024 but may drop to between 450 and 500 basis points in the second half of the year. Tightening policies by central banks around the world will limit money supplies. Research firm Deloitte claims that such a backdrop will create the conditions for divergent and sporadic economic growth, especially in the banking and financial sectors.\xa0', 'In the past few years, some of the best diversified banking stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co.

In 2022, banks in the US and Canada posted an 18% year-on-year increase in net interest income. Banks in Europe reported an 11% year-on-year increase in net interest income in the same year. High deposit costs are likely to remain a key area for concern in the banking world even as interest rates drop later this year.', 'In this overall environment, investors with banking stocks in their portfolios would be well-served by banking firms that have diversified sources of income. In mid-January, Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup Inc.

We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels. As I reflect on the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and for clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically and I’m very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times. 2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation. We expect to see growth slowing globally with the US well positioned to withstand a run-of-the-mill recession should one materialize. With a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and diligent risk management we are well positioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to path. Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths, given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures. 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our transformation. I recognize the importance of this year and I am highly confident that we will see the benefits of the actions we’ve taken through the momentum of our businesses.

One such opportunity is data analytics platform Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). Over the last year, shares in Palantir have soared 200%. That's quite impressive."", 'With such a meteoric rise in market value over a relatively short time frame, some investors may be curious if now is a good time for profit taking. After all, no stock can continue going up indefinitely, right?', ""Let's dig into why Palantir is enjoying a moment right now, and assess if trimming your position makes sense."", '2023 was hallmarked by a seemingly never-ending script of AI narratives -- many of which revolved around big tech. Microsoft kicked things off with its investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Amazon and Alphabet swiftly followed, each funding OpenAI competitor, Anthropic. In addition, Alphabet released its own generative AI chatbot called Bard, since renamed as Gemini.', 'Amid all of this hoopla, Palantir released its fourth flagship software product: Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Given this product launch took a backseat to all the moves made by big tech, Palantir had to get creative.', 'The company employed a unique lead generation strategy to help market the release of AIP. Namely, the company began hosting ""boot camps"" -- or immersive seminars during which prospective customers have an opportunity to demo Palantir\'s products and identify a use case centered around AI.', ""This campaign has been paying off in spades. Since AIP's release last April, Palantir has hosted over 800 boot camps and increased its customer count by 35% in 2023."", 'The rapid customer acquisition, plus a financially strong profile supported by robust free cash flow and consistent profits, reignited enthusiasm for Palantir stock.', 'The chart below benchmarks Palantir against a small cohort of high-growth software-as-a-service (SaaS) enterprises.

Until mid-February, Palantir's P/S was trading at a much more reasonable level. What happened? The company didn't just knock it out of the park during its fourth-quarter earnings presentation.

Palantir is proving it is moving at a faster pace than the competition, and even better days could be on the horizon."", 'Given the rapid ascent of Palantir stock, I understand the temptation of profit taking.

But consider the following: The stock is still 36% below its all-time high, something that doesn't look too obvious."", ""I see the recent price action in Palantir stock as mere rightsizing. In other words, the stock cratering to $6 at the end of 2022 wasn't deserved. Now, with shares trading much higher, it could be argued that Palantir stock is expensive."", ""Frankly, I see the premium over its peers as warranted. The company has a clear long-term vision centered around AI, which is more than other enterprise SaaS players can say. Moreover, the company's consistent profits have helped Palantir build a strong balance sheet and provide it with enviable financial flexibility."", ""While the stock has enjoyed a nice run, I'd continue holding here. The long-term picture looks strong, and the broader AI story is still being written.

""That\'s why companies are so focused on improving productivity. There\'s a lot of macro headwinds happening. So they are trying to find ways to improve productivity and sort of offset those headwinds.""', ""The headwinds Kwon references include the risk the Federal Reserve holds off on cutting interest rates as inflation's path downward continues to prove bumpier than initially hoped. Two separate reports released this week showed inflation was hotter than economists expected in February. And annual wage growth during the month was higher than what economists have said the Fed wants to see to feel confident inflation is moving down to its 2% target."", 'Read more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards', 'The research team at Carson Group argues an increase in productivity could offset these concerns, though.', '""With productivity soaring like it is and will hopefully continue like it can, you don\'t have to worry about inflation coming back, you really don\'t,"" Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance.', ""Detrick's colleague Sonu Varghese explained that persistent wage growth can usually cause an inflation problem if consumers have more money to spend on goods. Demand for goods would rise as workers make more money, therefore pushing prices higher. This paradigm shifts, though, if productivity picks up. In that instance, the economy could sustain higher wages because companies would also be producing more goods. If both the demand and supply of goods pick up, then prices can remain stable."", ""Varghese highlighted two different instances where wage growth surged. In the 1970s, wage growth picked up, but productivity didn't, leading to a decade-long battle with persistent inflation. In the 1990s, wage growth gains were met with a productivity boom and subsequently led to a prosperous stretch for both US economic growth and stock market gains."", 'As productivity picks up, it increases the overall trajectory of the US economic growth, Renaissance Macro head of economic research Neil Dutta told Yahoo Finance.', ""That's welcome news for stocks."", ""Companies can choose to use their increased financial gains from productivity in a variety of ways. One would be to keep boosting wages to lure in more workers. But recent shifts in the labor market show that likely won't be the case."", 'The labor market has shown some signs of softening, and the large pay bumps needed to lure workers into the post-lockdown job market have eased. The quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, hit its lowest level since August 2020 in January.', 'This would indicate that companies would take their additional revenues from increased productivity and use them to boost margins. Higher margins are usually a tailwind for future company earnings, which would in theory lift equities.', 'All of this comes without a mention of artificial intelligence, which has been lauded as a potential productivity booster.', '""AI is kind of like the cherry on the top,"" Kwon said. ""AI obviously is going to be a huge productivity enhancer. I don\'t know when that\'s going to happen.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all firmly placed the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror and blasted to record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength in various sectors and industries, much of the heavy lifting for the current bull market can be attributed to the ""Magnificent Seven.""', ""As their collective name implies, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. They're often industry leaders (sometimes in more than one category) and traditionally on the cutting edge of technological innovation(s). In order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:"", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', ""All seven of these companies have overwhelmingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over extended periods. This is a fact that's not lost on Wall Street's brightest and most successful institutional money managers."", 'However, there was a discernible shift in sentiment among billionaire investors during the December-ended quarter concerning the top-performing Magnificent Seven component: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia.', ""Investors who've put their money to work in artificial intelligence stocks have been handsomely rewarded -- perhaps none more so than Nvidia's shareholders."", ""In a little over a year's time, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the lion's share of GPUs currently in use in AI-accelerated data centers. In fact, many of the company's top customers are Magnificent Seven members, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet."", 'Optimists fully expect Nvidia to keep its foot on the accelerator as it ramps production of its prized A100 and H100 GPUs. With supply chain issues easing -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing boosting its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity -- Nvidia should be able to meet demand from more of its customers this year.', ""However, the Nvidia growth story may not be as picture-perfect as its stock chart would suggest. Aside from well-established valuation concerns, Nvidia is set to face a flurry of operating headwinds. Perhaps that's what compelled eight billionaires to sell shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parentheses):"", 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares)', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares)', 'David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares)', 'Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares)', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)', ""Most investors in AI stocks/Nvidia have probably heard all about incoming competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies have GPUs they've launched or plan to launch this year that are specifically designed to compete with Nvidia in enterprise data centers."", ""The far bigger concern for Nvidia is that the aforementioned four Magnificent Seven members that account for 40% of its sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own for use in their data centers. A significant percentage of Nvidia's sales may go away if these core customers shift to in-house AI chips. At best, Nvidia will see less in the way of purchases from these four juggernauts."", ""Another kick in the pants for Nvidia is that U.S. regulators are actively restricting exports of high-powered AI GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy, China. After the first round of restrictions, Nvidia developed toned-down versions of its powerhouse AI GPUs, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market. However, the newest round of export restrictions affects these models, too."", ""There's also a strong likelihood that Nvidia will sap its own gross margin as it increases production of its top-selling GPUs. With data center sales growing many multiples faster than cost of revenue in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on Jan. 28, 2024), it clearly shows that pricing power, not an increase in units sold, drove the company's sales higher. As GPU scarcity tapers, so will Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power."", ""To be perfectly fair, Nvidia wasn't the only AI stock and member of the Magnificent Seven that billionaire investors put on the chopping block during the fourth quarter. Prominent billionaire money managers commonly sold Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and even Microsoft stock during the previous quarter."", 'But there was one exception to this selling: E-commerce and cloud-services frontrunner Amazon. All told, eight high-profile billionaires piled into this multi-industry leader, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares)', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares)', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)', ""The biggest risk for Amazon at the moment is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. A couple of prominent money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest that the economy may weaken later this year. Since Amazon is the world's leading online marketplace and generates a sizable percentage of its sales from e-commerce, there's the logical perception that a recession would be trouble."", ""Yet what's interesting about Amazon is that very little of its operating cash flow or net income derives from online retail sales. Rather, the bulk of the company's cash flow and profits can be traced to its three fast-growing ancillary operating segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services."", 'A strong argument can be made that AWS is the single most important puzzle piece at Amazon. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, and AWS accounted for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. In other words, a sustained double-digit growth rate should be the expectation for this high-margin segment.', ""Don't overlook the importance of advertising services, either. Amazon is one of the most visited social sites in the world, with 2.3 billion to 2.7 billion aggregate visitors each month from July 2023 through December 2023. These are predominantly motivated shoppers, which makes Amazon a logical go-to for merchants wanting to target users with their message."", 'With regard to subscription services, Amazon surpassed 200 million worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos. The addition of Thursday Night Football as exclusive content has likely only added to this figure.', ""Although Amazon may not appear cheap based on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's valued at a historically inexpensive multiple relative to its future cash flow.

News of the sales sent the high-yielding dividend stock up 2.2% on Thursday.', 'In a filing, Altria said it plans to sell 35 million shares of Anheuser-Busch through a public offering at $61.50 a share, and in addition, it would sell $200 million worth of the stock directly to Anheuser-Busch. In total, Altria expects to receive $2.4 billion from the sale. The underwriters also have the option of purchasing an additional 5.25 million Anheuser-Busch shares from Altria, for which Altria would receive an additional $323 million, not including any fees associated with the transaction.', 'Altria will still retain a majority of the stake it had previously held in ABI, now worth approximately 8.1%, or roughly $10 billion of the alcohol giant.', ""Altria has long been a cash machine and returns most of its profits to investors in the form of a generous dividend. Historically, the company aims for a dividend payout ratio of 80%. Given its focus on returning capital to shareholders, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Altria is returning the new capital to shareholders, this time in the form of buybacks."", 'The company said it was increasing its existing $1 billion share repurchase program by $2.4 billion. It expects to complete those share repurchases by the end of the year as part of an accelerated share repurchase program.', 'CEO Billy Gifford said: ""We have a long-standing history of returning cash to our shareholders, and today\'s announcement reflects our continued desire to create long-term shareholder value.""', ""With Altria's market cap currently sitting at around $80 billion, the additional repurchases will have an immediate effect, leading the company to raise its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance from $5.00 to $5.15 to $5.05 to $5.17. This represents a growth rate of 2% to 4.5% from $4.95 in 2023. It also expects cash savings by reducing the number of shares that it needs to pay dividends on. Finally, the move will reduce its equity earnings from ABI, but it's still a net positive for earnings on a per-share basis."", ""Altria's minority stake in ABI is something of an accident of history. Philip Morris, as the company was known for most of its history, acquired Miller Brewing in 1969 at a time when the tobacco giant was diversifying its business interests. SAB acquired Miller in 2002, but Philip Morris retained a minority stake in the company. When Anheuser-Busch acquired SABMiller in 2016, that stake dwindled again, but the tobacco giant still held on to some."", ""ABI stock has underperformed the market in recent years, and the share sale makes sense in a number of ways. There's no strategic benefit for Altria in owning ABI. While there's an argument for diversification, at this point, the company might be better off diversifying elsewhere given ABI's performance."", 'If selling ABI stock allows Altria to increase its own earnings per share by repurchasing stock, and save cash on dividends, that sounds like a compelling argument for moving on from ABI.', 'However, there could be another motivation for the stock sale. Altria has committed to raising its dividend by mid-single-digit percentages annually through 2028, but doing so might not be that easy. Cigarette sales continue to decline, and the company has struggled to find a next-gen product to replace that lost business.', 'If that trend continues, profit growth could turn negative, and the company will have to look to alternatives like selling the remainder of its stake in ABI to fund the dividend. By repurchasing that stock, it will also save about $220 million in dividend payments annually, and further repurchases can be justified similarly. Altria also recently sold rights to the IQOS tobacco heating system back to Philip Morris International for $2.7 billion, raising a significant bundle of cash.', ""Altria isn't about to run out of cash, but growing profits is likely to get more difficult. Any sign that its prized dividend (which now yields 9%) might be in jeopardy could cause a sharp sell-off in the stock."", ""The improved earnings guidance from the ABI stock sale is nice, but it doesn't solve Altria's long-term problems, and those issues shouldn't be ignored."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Altria Group wasn’t one of them.

One could buy a brand-new flat-screen television, play the lottery, or keep it in a savings account. For people trying to increase their capital, though, investing in stocks easily beats out all three of those options -- provided, of course, that investors can pick the right companies to invest in.', ""For those with $1,000 to spare, let's consider two healthcare stocks worth investing in and holding onto for a long time: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) and HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA)."", ""One key to success for biotech companies is to constantly develop novel therapies that are superior to the existing standards of care. Vertex has mastered this art. The drugmaker markets the only medicines that address the underlying genetic causes of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare disease of the lungs. It isn't as though other companies haven't tried to crack this nut, but so far, all have failed."", ""That speaks volumes regarding Vertex's innovative abilities. The biotech has been rewarded for its troubles. Revenue, earnings, and free cash flow have increased rapidly."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals isn't slowing down, though. The company is still developing brand-new CF drugs. In February, the biotech reported phase 3 results from a new CF therapy, which showed non-inferiority when pitted against its current crown jewel, Trikafta. This new treatment also showed more significant reductions in sweat chloride (CF patients have higher levels of it) compared to Trikafta."", ""That was despite the newer medicine's convenient once-daily dosing -- Trikafta is taken twice a day. Besides improving its existing lineup, Vertex Pharmaceuticals also wants to treat those CF patients who aren't eligible for its current medicines. The company is working on that project, too. Elsewhere, the biotech is expanding its lineup. It earned approval for Casgevy, a gene editing therapy for a pair of blood diseases, late last year."", 'In January, it also reported positive late-stage results for its potential pain treatment, VX-548. There are several more candidates in mid and late-stage testing that should make meaningful progress in the next few years, leading to a transformed lineup and even stronger financial results in the next five to 10 years. At a price tag of about $414, $1,000 affords two shares.', ""HCA Healthcare is a leading hospital chain with facilities across much of the U.S. The company's business makes it hard for newcomers to pose a serious threat. Building dozens of medical facilities is hard enough. It involves jumping through various regulatory hoops and spending millions of dollars, but that's just step one. The next step is to build relationships with physicians, communities, and third-party payers. HCA Healthcare has already done all that."", ""That grants the company a serious advantage over new challengers. And even when pitted against existing competitors, HCA Healthcare has generally increased its market share. Between 2011 and 2022, it went from 23% to 28.5%. Naturally, HCA Healthcare's solid position has translated to strong financial results."", ""It hasn't always been smooth sailing; the pandemic disrupted occupancy levels and the number of procedures performed in its facilities, which are key components in HCA Healthcare's revenue formula. The subsequent economic issues also strained its expenses and squeezed the bottom line. However, HCA Healthcare has been able to bounce back for the most part. The headwinds it has encountered lately were highly unusual."", ""They won't substantially alter HCA Healthcare's progress over the long run. The demand for the company's services will only increase with an aging population that needs more medical care. So, HCA Healthcare's robust position in its industry should lead to solid returns over the long run.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the struggle of American workers, you may go to 10 Best Cities to Retire on $3,500 a Month.', 'According to retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, the retirement system in the United States of America has left behind the bottom 90% of workers. Unable to support themselves on Social Security benefits and savings, these people often find themselves working into old age. Credit Karma, a financial services firm, reveals that an estimated 27% of people aged 59 or older have no retirement savings at all, further reinforcing the need to work post-retirement to support themselves. These findings are noteworthy considering the Social Security trust fund is all set to be depleted by 2034, resulting in a cut in benefits for the millions of Americans who depend on it.', 'Of the 67 million retirees depending on Social Security, a depleted trust fund implies that each beneficiary ought to receive only 77 cents for every $1 in benefits- with the poorest Americans being affected the most. However, it’s not that Americans don’t want to save for retirement, but rather that they don\'t have an option otherwise. As noted by a retirement survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), a growing number of US workers are finding it hard to save for retirement altogether. As of 2022, 47% of the respondents in the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey revealed that they believed they were ""very likely"" to reach their retirement goals. However, this percentage went down to 37% in a year.', 'The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) accurately captures this phenomenon in what they consider to be a “financial vortex”. Due to this financial vortex, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) warns that workers fail to understand what to prioritize, and this is in turn pushing back their retirement by many years. This is true despite many Americans having improved their level of savings in the past year. However, the complex financial landscape, characterized by competing responsibilities like credit card debt, saving for college, and providing financial support to family members, has disrupted savings strategies. This has resulted in a delay in retirement plans by four or more years for 21% of respondents, according to a Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) retirement report.', '""While retirement sentiment improved over last year, the financial vortex remains a huge problem for many workers and retirees. Its challenges are largely immune to improvement in markets and the economy and will continue to impact new generations of retirement savers”.', '-Chris Ceder, senior retirement strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)', 'While the above scenario may be true for the bottom 90% of American workers, Empower, a financial services company, reveals that more than half of Americans may be in the job market post-retirement and open to work “indefinitely”. This report implies that while a majority of workers do work for the money after retirement, many more do so for reasons such as personal fulfillment \\. Nevertheless, one reality for a large portion of retirees in the US is that they live on fixed incomes. For this reason, they must learn to live on either their social security benefits or an amount that includes their minimal savings. For a certain portion of retirees, this figure is near about $3,500.

They said Rite Aid's practices contributed to the risk of consumers experiencing discrimination."", ""The FTC also issued a general warning to companies using biometric surveillance, indicating that they'll be cracking down on misuse of that technology, which retailers, like Rite Aid, implemented to curb theft.

I think, more and more of the retailers are saying we've got to safeguard our people in these spaces. So now, they're putting things that would arguably invade someone's privacy, but nobody goes to jail based on an alert on any kind of AI technology.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Countries in Do Not Travel List.\xa0', 'Four years back, during COVID-19, the travel and tourism industry came to an abrupt halt. However, it is now making a gradual return to its pre-pandemic heights. The UNWTO predicted the tourism industry to recover 90% of pre-COVID levels at year-end 2023. In February 2024 alone, over 4.9 million US citizens traveled outside the country, according to the International Trade Administration’s data.\xa0', 'Another recent report published by UN Tourism forecasts that the international tourism industry will fully recover its pre-pandemic levels by 2024 — with a strong travel stream from the US due to the rising strength of the US dollar. Since the pandemic, people have realized globally the importance of a living-for-experiences lifestyle, and have started to invest more in different forms of travel such as “wellness travel”. At the same time, however, persisting inflation, high-interest rates, volatile oil prices, and disruptions to trade are causing transport and accommodation costs to rise. Therefore, tourists are now opting for cheaper destinations that are closer to their home country, and adopting sustainable practices.', 'Another factor that is now affecting the travel industry is the mounting geopolitical tensions and conflict eruptions across the world. Travelers are more cautious about their travels and are willing to learn more about the potential risks of traveling to their desired destinations. So, to help US travelers navigate their travels safely, The U.S. State Department issues individual travel advisory levels for over 200 countries worldwide. These are updated frequently and are ranked based on several risk factors, such as health, terrorism, and civil unrest.', ""The US Travel Advisory’s ranking has four levels. Level 1 means that the country has no major safety risks, but travelers should still exercise normal precautions. When risks to safety and security are heightened in a country, it gets a level 2 rating. Similarly, the level 3 travel advisory countries pose serious risks to the safety and security of citizens as well as tourists. Someone who's planning to travel to level 3 countries is advised to reconsider their travel by the advisory board. The Department of State provides additional guidance to those already in such regions through its website."", 'If a country has a travel advisory of level 4, it means that travelers should not travel to that country at all. That’s because there is a greater likelihood of falling victim to acts of terrorism, being kidnapped, or getting stuck amidst conflict. Plus, in an emergency, the US government has little to no means to assist its citizens in level 4 advisory countries. Therefore, they are listed as “do not travel” countries. There are also a few countries labeled as “other.” For example, China. That’s because, there are parts of the country that are safe to travel to, parts where caution needs to be exercised, and areas where travel needs to be reconsidered due to safety concerns. So, countries listed as “others” by the travel advisory may or may not be safe depending on which area or parts the tourists travel to.\xa0', 'For those wanting to travel to these “other” countries, or countries with level 3 and 4 warnings despite being advised not to, the advisory has laid out guidelines that need to be followed. Individuals may also reach out to travel risk management (TRM) companies; they identify, assess, and mitigate risks to protect individuals during their travel to a high-risk area.', 'Some key players in the global travel risk management services industry include Everbridge Inc (NASDAQ:EVBG), Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. (MIL:G.MI)’s GGA.', 'Everbridge Inc (NASDAQ: EVBG), a global leader in critical event management (CEM) and safety software applications, is a company that provides information about critical events and helps travelers with personal safety and business continuity. Essentially, it allows users to send notifications to individuals, groups, lists, and geographic locations so they can anticipate, mitigate, and respond to emergency situations. The company has over 160 patents to its name, representing its dedication to innovation and technology. In 2023, Everbridge Inc (NASDAQ: EVBG) received a new patent related to incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in analytics dashboards for CEM software systems.', 'Meanwhile, Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE) is an American travel technology company that owns and operates several aggregators across the travel industry. Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE) ensures the safety of travelers in remote or dangerous locations through a comprehensive approach that includes developing and sharing a safety toolkit that identifies the health and safety risks to the travelers. Moreover, Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE) has also incorporated generative AI into some of its features and products targeted to travelers.\xa0', 'Lastly, Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. (MIL:G.MI)’s Generali Global Assistance (GGA) is a company that offers travel risk management solutions as well as sharing resources regarding unforeseen safety and security risks, such as Hurricane Resources Center. Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. (MIL:G.MI) also owns GMMI, which is a global medical risk management company', 'Below, we list the biggest countries on the US Travel Advisory’s Do Not Travel list.', 'For our list of the 25 Biggest Countries in Do Not Travel List, we have sourced our data from the US Travel Advisories. To rank the list for the biggest countries, we have considered the area of each country and sourced our data from the CIA’s database. Note that there are only 19 countries on the US Do Not Travel list, but some countries on the Reconsider Travel list have large portions of the country listed as “do not travel.” Therefore, we have included six level 3 countries on our list too. The list is in ascending order of area.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

The government asks tourists to reconsider their choice to travel to Lebanon because even though it's a beautiful country, there’s a high risk of tourists falling victim to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, unexploded landmines, and armed conflict. Some areas also have increased risk, especially near the borders. The level 4 areas in Lebanon include the entire southern Lebanon, the Lebanon-Syria border, and Lebanon’s refugee settlements. The country’s safety status was last updated on January 29, 2024."", 'Total land area (sq km): 10,991', 'The 24th largest country on the list, Jamaica is also a level 3 country where violent crimes, armed robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides are extremely common. Jamaica has fourteen parishes in total, and out of these, nine are marked as do not travel zones for tourists. Other level four areas in the country include the town of Yallahs, the Whitehall, Bethel Town, Red Ground neighborhoods of Negri, Green Vale, Gray Ground, and the Vineyard neighborhoods of Mandeville. The travel advisory last updated Jamaica’s safety status on January 23, 2024.', 'Total land area (sq km): 27,750', 'Haiti is one of the most politically unstable countries in the world. It is marked as a do-not-travel country by the travel advisory since July 27, 2023, after the U.S. Department of State’s ordered departure of family members of U.S. government employees and non-emergency U.S. government employees from the country. The State Department also advised all U.S. citizens in Haiti to depart Haiti as soon as possible through any commercial or private transportation available. Kidnapping, violent crime, armed robbery, carjackings, and civil unrest are extremely common in the country too.\xa0', 'Total land area (sq km): 120,538', ""North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is classified as a do-not-travel country by the advisory because of the constant (and extremely serious) risks of arrest and long-term wrongful detention of U.S. nationals. As of 2024, all U.S. passports are invalid for travel to, in, or through North Korea unless specially validated by the authority of the Secretary of State. Since the U.S. government does not have any diplomatic or consular relations with DPRK, in cases of emergency, the American government is unable to provide services to its citizens."", 'Total land area (sq km): 187,437', 'Syria, a country in the Middle East, has a history that dates all the way back to over 700,000 years. However, most of its history comprises conflicts and destruction. Modern-day Syria is trapped in the clutches of a brutal multi-sided war that has been ongoing since 2011. A year after the war broke out, in February 2012, the US Embassy in Syria’s capital — Damascus — suspended its operations. As of 2024, the US government is still unable to provide any sort of emergency services to its citizens should they travel to Syria and face any issues. To this day, armed conflict is very much active in the country, meaning that no part of Syria is safe from violence. Given these factors and the state of terrorism and unrest in the country, the US Travel Advisory has issued a level 4 warning for Syria.\xa0\xa0', 'Total land area (sq km): 207,600', 'The 20th biggest country on the list of countries on the Do Not Travel list, Belarus is also on the US Travel Advisory’s Do Not Travel list due to the country’s facilitation of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. It was last updated for safety concerns on July 26, 2023. The Belarusian authorities have detained thousands of people, including US citizens, for alleged affiliations with opposition parties and participation in political demonstrations. There is also the potential for civil unrest in the country. The U.S. Embassy has extremely limited ability to assist Americans in Belarus in case of emergencies.

It could also show whether the yoke was pushed forward, sending the plane rapidly downward — a scenario The Wall Street Journal reported the investigators are probing, and which may have involved a flight attendant hitting a switch while serving pilots a meal.', '“There’s absolutely no way this will be a mystery,” said Peter Goelz, who led investigations as managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, and is now a CNN aviation analyst. “The recorder will indicate if something was starting and what happened.”', 'Regardless of what the FDR shows, the contents of the orange steel box with reflective tape typically mounted in the rear of the plane, which is meant to reduce the risk of damage in a crash, have proven pivotal in past airplane investigations.', 'In 2015, investigators used the FDR to conclude that a pilot of Germanwings flight 9525 deliberately slammed the airliner into a mountain and ruled out potential airplane malfunctions. The FDR recorded 600 parameters onto a modern memory card and investigators extracted the data despite its exposure to extreme temperatures in the crash.', 'Sophisticated laboratories like those run by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and its counterparts in France, Australia and the United Kingdom, can reconstruct even broken memory cards and then line up the data with audio feeds into the cockpit voice recorder. The bright orange color of the container that houses the recorder, a well as locator beacons, help searchers locate the recorders. The devices found underwater are typically transported to the lab inside water before being carefully dried, Goelz said.', 'The 787 Dreamliner — one of Boeing’s more recently developed aircraft — feeds data into the flight data recorder through a system called the Common Data Network, which some compare to the human body’s central nervous system. It first flew in 2009 and uses new-at-the-time data transfer technologies.', 'US regulations specify about 90 parameters that must be fed into the black box. The list includes the thrust for each engine, temperature, flap settings, and the plane’s direction. International Civil Aviation Organization standards further specify how often and detailed the data must be. Altitude, for example, is recorded four times per second and accurate to the half-degree.', 'The data now encompasses “every parameter you can imagine — like notes on a musical score,” said Kathleen Bangs, a spokeswoman for the aviation tracking site FlightAware, and a former pilot. “When they take all that data and lay it all together, and put this musical score together, that’s when you get really get the full picture.”', 'But the black boxes are not the only tools investigators will have. Many components of modern planes, such as the engines, also contain computer chips that track detailed data.', 'Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is equipment on aircraft that transmits real-time data including the airplane’s position. The Federal Aviation Administration used this data after ungrounding Boeing’s 737 Max in late 2020 to track every Max flight.', 'Data is also sent to airlines using the Aircraft Communications, Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which transmits automated and manually entered messages between airlines and airplanes using radio waves and satellite links.', 'Some aircraft also carry a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) that is not hardened like the FDR but tracks the same data. The QAR can be easily hooked up to a laptop and allow airline employees to download plane performance information for analysis.', 'But it wasn’t always this way.', 'When United Airlines flight 585 crashed shortly before landing in March 1991, the FDR held five data points: direction, speed, altitude, G-force, and whether the radio microphone was keyed to transmit. When US Air flight 427 crashed three years later near Pittsburgh, the FDR recorded 11 parameters.', '“If these airplanes had been equipped with FDRs with additional parameters, that information would have undoubtedly allowed quick identification of critical control surface movements and their sources and other airplane system conditions that could have been involved in the loss of airplane control,” the NTSB said in a 1999 report referencing those two crashes. “Thus, investigators would have been able to more quickly rule out certain factors, when warranted, and focus on other areas.”', 'The NTSB recommended regulators increase the requirements, which ultimately took effect in the early 2000s.', 'Aircraft cockpits may one day contain a new generation of recording devices: video cameras. The NTSB called for the cameras, saying it could help investigators understand the moments before an incident. Some unions oppose the cameras, saying there are more effective and less invasive ways to obtain enough data. US lawmakers abandoned a plan to include a cockpit video camera when crafting this year’s expansive FAA legislation.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.', 'As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$574m. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 7.2% for shareholders.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.', ""Skyworks Solutions already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Skyworks Solutions' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.2% and 4.8% of the stock."", 'Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.', ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least.

However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', ""Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Skyworks Solutions, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$59m worth of shares.

However, price isn't the only factor worth considering when comparing these retailers.

Nike reported just a 1% year-over-year sales uptick in the most recent quarter while Lululemon achieved 19% gains."", ""Lots of factors went into that difference, but the biggest is Nike's exposure to a footwear industry that's struggling with too much supply. Retailing partners like Foot Locker are cutting prices in response and have been trimming their inventories. These moves leave Nike with few attractive options to reaccelerate growth."", ""That challenge is clear enough in Nike's short-term outlook that calls for even weaker sales trends over the next six months. Lululemon, in contrast, hiked its fiscal-year outlook in January, saying in a press release that sales will rise by as much as 15% in 2023."", ""Nike's weaker profit margin is another metric worth watching if you're thinking the stock is a no-brainer value. Sure, the management team is pivoting to a cost-cutting focus. But it will likely be several quarters before that strategic shift starts to really pay off.

Combined with Nike's weaker growth rate, this profitability gap implies much slower annual earnings growth compared to its smaller peer."", ""An investor might still prefer Nike stock over Lululemon for factors like its large global sales footprint ($51 billion vs. $9 billion) and its cheaper valuation. These points reduce the risk that you'll dramatically overpay for Nike shares, especially given the pessimism around its business today."", ""Still, Lululemon is the stronger growth stock, and so it has the best chance at delivering market-thumping returns over the long term. Don't forget that Nike's rebound strategy could disappoint investors as well, just as it has in the past.

But there are still compelling investment opportunities."", ""Take a look at PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). This fintech giant's shares are about 80% off their peak price. Don't let that price history discourage you, though."", 'Here are three reasons that PayPal is a no-brainer growth stock to buy now with $100 and hold for the long term.', 'One of the most obvious reasons that investors will want to scoop up shares of PayPal is because of just how much it dominates the electronic payments industry. PayPal was founded more than two decades ago, so it has a long and successful history of facilitating global commerce.', 'This is a scaled business, with a presence in more than 200 countries and regions. Total payment volume (TPV) was $1.5 trillion in 2023. That was up 13% over 2022 and more than double the amount in pre-pandemic 2019. ', 'Data from the end of 2022 shows that PayPal was the most widely accepted digital wallet, with a near 80% acceptance rate, at the top 1,500 retailers in North America and Europe. And its Braintree segment, which caters to merchants, has grown TPV at a much faster clip than the rest of the business.', 'PayPal is clearly a dominant force. As online shopping and other forms of cashless transactions become more popular, the business should benefit from a long-term growth driver.', 'PayPal possesses numerous competitive advantages. This is another important reason buying this stock makes sense right now.', 'As of Dec. 31, the business had 428 million active accounts using its services, creating a two-sided platform of merchants and consumers. This results in powerful network effects, which is an extremely attractive characteristic for a business to have.', 'Because PayPal has so many users already on its platform, it is able to make exponentially more connections between buyers and sellers. This means that PayPal is more valuable to all of its users than smaller payments systems.', 'The company has solved the chicken-and-egg problem. In other words, it would be virtually impossible for someone to start a new network from scratch because they would struggle to add merchants and consumers without any existing customers to target or anywhere to shop.', ""This setup gives PayPal a tremendous data advantage. It is able to collect insights about spending patterns and user behavior from transactions that it processes from both retailers and individuals, leading to improved authorization rates and lower fraud. A payments company that only works with one side of a transaction doesn't have the thorough perspective PayPal does. Merchants can appreciate this, giving the company a key selling point."", ""Of course, just because PayPal possesses these advantages doesn't mean it's fully protected from the changing industry landscape. At the end of the day, it's all about making the lives of users easier, with commerce becoming more frictionless over time. There is no shortage of competitors that PayPal has to fend off. But its standing in the industry does deserve some credit."", ""It's certainly discouraging for shareholders to see that PayPal hasn't participated in the market's rally since the start of 2023. Even though the business has continued to post solid financial results, the stock is cheap right now, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12.2."", ""At that kind of beaten-down valuation, investors might assume that they're getting a subpar business. But based on the factors outlined above, PayPal is better than the average company out there. It also has a strong balance sheet and generates steady free cash flow that management uses to repurchase shares."", 'I believe starting a small position in the stock makes sense.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But investors still turn to the time-tested index to get a pulse on the market."", ""That's because the 30 components in the Dow are leading companies that act as representatives for their respective industries."", ""To reflect the changing composition of the market's constituents, the Dow has gradually become more tech focused. Microsoft and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were added in 1999. Apple joined in 2015. Salesforce was added in 2020. In February, Amazon replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance. That means that three tech-focused stocks have been added to the Dow within the last nine years."", 'With the pace of change accelerating, I think it\'s reasonable to assume the other four ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks could be in the Dow by 2030. Here\'s how it could happen, and the companies that could be replaced.', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the most valuable companies in the market for some time. But it was essentially ineligible for inclusion in the Dow until its stock split in July 2022.', ""Stock splits don't matter in the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite because they are market cap-weighted. But the Dow is price-weighted, so the arbitrary price of stock determines its weight in the Dow. The highest-price Dow stock right now is UnitedHealth Group at around $476 per share, the lowest is Verizon at $39.50, and the median is around $173."", 'Amazon was a perfect addition to the Dow because it is an industry-leading company and it is right around the median price. Amazon split its stock just one month before Alphabet in June 2022.', ""Alphabet is around $135 a share, so it would have a below-average weighting. I think that works in Alphabet's favor so as not to make the index too tech-heavy. In fact, replacing International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), which has a stock price around $195, would reduce tech's weight in the Dow and set the stage for future Magnificent Seven additions."", 'Alphabet and IBM have some overlap, particularly with their cloud business units. But Alphabet is an overall stronger business than IBM and is a better representative of the economy.', 'The communications sector makes up just 2.5% of the Dow, compared to 88.% in the S&P 500, while the three most valuable communications companies are Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Netflix. I believe, the Dow should better represent the importance of search, social media, and digital advertising. Alphabet checks those boxes through Google and YouTube (often considered a form of social media). Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are the three largest cloud infrastructure players, so adding Alphabet to the list makes sense.', ""Sticking with the theme of better representing the communications sector, let's go ahead and boot Verizon in favor of Meta Platforms. At a price below $40 a share, Verizon is currently the lowest-weighted stock in the Dow. Meta is around $505 a share. If added, it would be the most valuable company in the index. But it would be much more reasonable if Meta issued a 3-for-1 or 4-for-1 stock split."", 'Meta Platforms dominate social media and digital advertising. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp offer arguably the most valuable digital real estate for advertisers worldwide. Meta Platforms spends a ton of money on research and development in its Reality Labs segment, giving the Dow exposure to virtual reality and other themes still in their infancy.', ""This is probably the easiest swap on this list. It's been 25 years since Intel was added to the Dow. And yet it still hasn't reached the sky-high price it hit during the Dot-com bust. In fact, Intel isn't even in the top-five most valuable semiconductor companies."", 'Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the clear semiconductor industry leader. It is also the driver behind artificial intelligence (AI). If AI becomes as big as, say, social media or mobile phones, then the Dow should have an AI stock. Nvidia can fill that void and replace another chip stock in the process.', ""Nvidia would have to issue a 5-for-1 stock split at a minimum. But there's already talk that could happen. At just $44 a share, Intel is the second-lowest weighted stock in the Dow. In order to not tip the balance too much, it would be great if Nvidia issued a 10-for-1 stock split to give the stock a price below $100."", ""General Motors was famously removed from the Dow when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. Since then, the auto industry hasn't been represented in the Dow."", ""Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) isn't in the Dow right now, but it could be added in the years to come. For that to happen, electric vehicles (EVs) must make up a far higher percentage of cars sold."", ""In September 2022, the International Energy Agency famously predicted that EVs would make up 60% of vehicles sold globally by 2030. If Tesla continues to grow and stays the market leader, it could deserve a spot in the Dow, especially considering the index's constituents tend to be leaders on the global stage, and there is no other American car company that currently has that potential."", 'The decision to replace commodity chemical company Dow (NYSE: DOW) is a bit nuanced. Note that Dow -- the chemical company -- has nothing to do with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but it is a component of the index (confusing, I know).', ""Tesla for Dow is the least clean swap on this list. Dow has a price per share around just $57. It is the fourth-lowest-weighted stock in the index. There's nothing particularly wrong with the company, and it's good to represent the basic materials sector. But Tesla has become a bit of a materials company in its own right, with a complicated supply chain for resourcing inputs to make batteries and the rest of its products. Its renewables exposure is also unique and something that isn't really covered in the Dow Jones Industrial Average."", 'Tesla could represent the auto industry, renewable energy, and other ESG themes. There are good arguments for Tesla replacing a different stock other than Dow. But if EVs continue to take market share and Tesla remains a leader, it could find its way into the Dow one way or another.', 'The Dow Jones hasn\'t been an ""industrial average"" for some time. Even today, the industrial sector makes up just 14.2% of the index. Rather, the Dow acts as a house of representatives for the broader market.', 'The Magnificent Seven are leaders in industries that should continue to grow for decades to come.

Investors can gain confidence knowing that Visa's and Mastercard's shares have climbed 900% in just the past 12 or so years, give or take a few months. So, as we look ahead, investors are expecting the returns to slow a bit."", ""I think that's a totally reasonable expectation. These two businesses are worth hundreds of billions of dollars each. Naturally, their future returns probably won't match the past.

Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve\'s next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC\'s ""The Exchange"" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:', '""Based on his [Powell\'s] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.""', ""According to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on."", 'Apart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising.

We\'ll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD\'s latest chip, then that\'s gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we\'ll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that\'ll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise...

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the economic impact of gender inequality, you can directly go to the 5 Worst Countries for Gender Equality.\xa0', 'The question of gender inequality has been a part of the international policymaking agenda for a long time, and yet, significant barriers continue to persist in the domain. According to data from UN Women, the world has over 796 million illiterate people, more than two-thirds of whom are women. Another estimate states that 60% of the world’s chronically hungry population consists of women and girls. According to WEF’s Global Gender Gap Report 2020, only 55% of adult women are a part of the labor force, compared with 78% of men. In addition, the global wage gap is still higher than 40%, whereas the worldwide income gap is more than 50%.\xa0', 'World Bank’s Women, Business, and The Law Report from 2022 concluded that globally, 2.4 billion women of working age did not have equal economic opportunity. Around 178 countries had legal barriers preventing women from full economic participation, while 95 countries did not provide equal salaries for equal work. The global gap between the expected lifetime earnings of men and women was estimated to be $172 trillion, more than two times the world’s annual GDP. Furthermore, data showed that women only received three-quarters of the total legal rights awarded to men. Out of the 190 countries whose data was surveyed by the WB report, only 12 showcased complete gender parity. Keeping this in view, you can also review the 30 Worst Countries for Women’s Rights.\xa0', 'As the topic of equal access to economic opportunities continues to be a significant point in national and international arenas, one has to look at why this matters. UN Women reports that in developing countries, women make up 43% of the agricultural labor force. If these women had access to the same resources as their male counterparts, they could increase their farming yield by up to 30%. This could raise the total agricultural output of these developing countries by 4%, reducing world hunger by 12%-17%. Thus, providing women access to similar resources could potentially offset a global chain of positive reactions.\xa0', 'A McKinsey & Company Global Insitute Report found that resolving the gender gap could increase global GDP by $12 trillion, which amounts to 11%.

Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve\'s next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC\'s ""The Exchange"" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:', '""Based on his [Powell\'s] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.""', ""According to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on."", 'Apart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as\xa0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present.\xa0 On March 15, CNBC\'s Kristina Partsinevelos joined the ""Halftime Report"" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here\'s what she said:', '""The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA\'s] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We\'ll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD\'s latest chip, then that\'s gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we\'ll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that\'ll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.""', 'These comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for McDonald's:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.24 = US$12b ÷ (US$56b - US$6.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 9.6%."", "" See our latest analysis for McDonald's "", ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering McDonald's  for free."", ""We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like McDonald's. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 24% and the business has deployed 65% more capital into its operations. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 24%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models."", 'In short, we\'d argue McDonald\'s has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. Therefore it\'s no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 69% return if they held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.', ""One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing McDonald's that you might find interesting."", 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Two of the biggest are oil giants Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). They currently clock in as Berkshire's fifth and sixth largest holdings."", ""Buffett's company has added to those oil stocks over the past few months. Given the current oil price point and other catalysts they have on the horizon, those purchases could really pay off. That upside makes them stocks that investors will want to make sure they grab this month."", ""Berkshire Hathaway currently owns over 126 million shares of Chevron, or about 6.8% of its outstanding shares, worth more than $19.6 billion, or 5.4% of its investment portfolio. Buffett's company recently boosted its position in the oil giant. His company took advantage of a sell-off in the oil stock following its decision to buy rival Hess in a roughly $60 billion deal. "", ""Acquiring Hess would enhance and extend Chevron's production and free cash flow growth outlook into the 2030s. It would enable the oil giant to more than double its free cash flow by 2027, assuming crude averages around $70 per barrel. Oil is currently in the $80s, meaning it would produce an even bigger gusher of cash in the future, assuming it closes the deal and oil remains at the higher level. Neither is a sure thing, especially since rival ExxonMobil, Hess' partner in a lucrative offshore oil development in Guyana, might seek to acquire Hess' position in that project. "", ""However, Chevron can still thrive even if it doesn't acquire Hess. The company's current high-return capital program positions it to grow its free cash flow by more than 10% annually through 2027, assuming oil averages $60 per barrel. That would enable it to produce enough cash to fund its capital program; grow its attractive dividend, which is currently yielding 4.2%; and repurchase shares at the low end of its $10 billion to $20 billion annual target range, which is enough to retire about 3% of its outstanding shares at the current price. Meanwhile, at $70 oil, it could repurchase stock at the high end of that range, which is enough to retire 6% of its outstanding shares each year. "", ""Add in Chevron's attractive income yield to its upside potential, and the oil giant could deliver strong total returns in the coming years even if oil prices cool off and the Hess deal falls apart."", 'Buffett\'s company has been buying shares of Occidental Petroleum hand over fist. It currently owns over 248 million shares, which account for an eye-popping 28.2% of its outstanding shares and are worth $15.5 billion, or 4.2% of its investment portfolio. Warren Buffett recently highlighted Occidental as having the characteristics of a ""forever"" holding. ', ""One of the things Buffett loves about Occidental is its leadership in helping make America the world's top oil producer. The company has helped unlock a treasure trove of oil and gas in the Permian Basin, where it's one of the leading producers."", 'Occidental is working to bolster its position in that key oil basin by agreeing to acquire CrownRock for $12 billion. The acquisition will boost its free cash flow by $1 billion over the next year at $70 oil. On top of that, it will enhance its low-cost resource base. The growing cash flow from this deal will give Occidental the money to repay debt; repurchase shares, including the preferred stock owned by Berkshire Hathaway; and grow its dividend. It recently boosted its payout by another 22%. ', ""On top of its oil business, Occidental is emerging as a leader in the potentially lucrative carbon capture and storage market. It's building the world's largest direct air capture project in the Permian Basin, which should come online next year. Several companies have purchased carbon credits from the company to support the commercialization of that project, which is the first of many it has in development. Occidental believes it could eventually make as much money off carbon capture as it currently does producing oil and gas. "", 'Chevron and Occidental have gained less than 5% this year, even though crude prices have surged 13%. They trade at very compelling values, given the cash they can produce at the current oil price point. Add in their other catalysts, and they look like very compelling buys right now.

Since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an aggregate return of 4,938,103% in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on March 14. For the sake of comparison, this is 146 times greater than the aggregate total return of the S&P 500, including dividends paid, over the same period."", 'Even though the affably named ""Oracle of Omaha"" won\'t be right all the time, his track record suggests he has a knack for finding value that\'s hiding in plain sight. That\'s why investors wait so anxiously for Berkshire Hathaway\'s Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).', 'A 13F is a required filing each quarter for institutional money managers who are overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management. As of March 14, Buffett and his team had $366 billion of invested assets spread across 45 stocks and two index funds.', ""What makes 13Fs valuable is they allow investors to easily see what Wall Street's brightest and most successful money managers have been buying, selling, and holding. These filings can provide valuable insight into what stocks and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors."", ""For example, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs have shown that Warren Buffett and his investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been actively adding to their positions in two energy stocks: Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Though energy stocks have historically not accounted for a sizable percentage of Berkshire's invested assets, the combination of Chevron and Occidental comprise nearly 10% of the aforementioned $366 billion portfolio."", ""Having this much capital put to work in two integrated oil and gas stocks is a pretty clear message that Berkshire Hathaway's brightest minds expect the spot price of oil to remain above historic norms, if not head even higher. Years of capital underinvestment during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight global oil supply, which is helping to lift the spot price of crude."", 'Being able to track the investments Warren Buffett makes has allowed investors to ride his coattails to potentially life-changing returns.', 'However, Berkshire Hathaway\'s 13F isn\'t telling the full story in more ways than one. In addition to Warren Buffett\'s company having a $621 million ""secret"" portfolio, Berkshire Hathaway has also been granted an exemption by the SEC for confidential treatment regarding one or more of its holdings.', ""In other words, Buffett and his team are building a position in one or more companies, and they don't want the cat to be let out of the bag while doing so. Since investors tend to pile into the stocks Buffett and his aides purchase, this confidential treatment allows Berkshire to, presumably, build its stake at a lower cost basis."", 'Berkshire\'s last two quarterly 13Fs have come with this confidential treatment disclosure, which means the Oracle of Omaha and his aides have been purchasing shares of a stock, or multiple stocks, from perhaps July through December. Though I\'ve previously thrown a dart at which mystery stock this might be, new clues point to a very specific company as Warren Buffett\'s ""confidential stock.""', ""While there are genuinely thousands of publicly traded companies that Buffett could, in theory, be putting his money to work in, three clues quickly narrow down the field. First, we can examine how much Berkshire Hathaway spent purchasing equity securities during the third and fourth quarters and compare this figure to the rough value of the stocks purchased during those respective quarters, as listed in Berkshire's 13Fs. In the neighborhood of $5 billion in equity security purchases is unaccounted for on a combined basis over the second-half of 2023."", ""What's interesting about this figure is that Berkshire Hathaway would be required to file with the SEC once it's reached at least a 5% stake in a publicly traded company. Since there's currently no filing, it intimates that the company Buffett and his team are secretly buying has a market cap of $100 billion or more. That eliminates all but 120 publicly traded companies in the U.S."", 'Secondly, Berkshire Hathaway\'s fourth-quarter operating results show that the company\'s cost basis for equity securities held in ""banks, insurance, and finance"" grew by $2.38 billion to $27.14 billion from the September-ended quarter. This cost basis grew despite Buffett and Co. selling stakes in insurers Markel Group and Globe Life. This is something my Foolish colleague Adam Levy pointed out two weeks ago, and all but ensures that Buffett\'s confidential stock hails from the financial sector.', 'There are only 24 stocks with a $100 billion or greater market cap found in the financial sector.', 'The third clue is that Warren Buffett loves a good deal and will stubbornly sit on his hands until he gets one. This means any stock with a relatively high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is off the table. Setting the forward P/E cap at 15 reduces the number of candidates to just 13.', ""Among the 13 remaining financial stocks are a handful of companies Berkshire already owns, including Bank of America, American Express, and Citigroup, as well as companies that were sold within the past few quarters or years, such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo. It's highly unlikely Buffett would reenter JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, or Wells Fargo on a confidential basis, and we'd see buying activity via the 13F if it was the former three stocks Berkshire currently owns."", 'This leaves seven possible choices:', 'Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS)', 'HSBC Holdings', 'Royal Bank of Canada', 'Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (NYSE: MUFG)', 'Toronto Dominion Bank', 'Chubb', 'UBS Group', ""Having followed Buffett's trading activity for so long, I can't recall a time when he's shown much, if any, interest in Canadian banks. Furthermore, while the Oracle of Omaha is willing to go to bat for a reclamation project in the U.S. (e.g., Bank of America in 2011), European banks aren't his cup of tea. This likely eliminates HSBC, UBS, Toronto Dominion, and Royal Bank of Canada from the discussion."", ""To go one step further, Berkshire's investment team just purged its portfolio of Markel and Globe Life, meaning there's probably not a big desire to pile into an internationally based insurer like Chubb."", 'This leaves two companies that meet what Warren Buffett is looking for: Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which is better known as ""MUFG.""', 'Morgan Stanley can\'t be ruled out as Berkshire\'s potential ""secret"" buy. It\'s valued at 12 times forward-year earnings and generates a substantial portion of its sales and profits from the company\'s wealth management division. In theory, wealth management should help insulate Morgan Stanley from inevitable downturns in the U.S. and global economy.', 'But the financial stock that makes the most sense for Buffett and his team to confidentially buy is MUFG.', 'In Warren Buffett\'s recently released annual letter to shareholders, he described the small group of companies he values as core holdings that will be held ""indefinitely."" While Coca-Cola and American Express unsurprisingly made the list, the Oracle of Omaha touted Occidental Petroleum and the five Japanese trading houses -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Sumitomo, and Marubeni -- as companies he\'d never sell. In fact, Buffett has upped his company\'s stake to around 9% in each of these Japanese trading houses. Berkshire\'s investment team have not hidden their belief that Japan\'s economy can outperform over the long run.', ""MUFG is the largest bank by assets in Japan. More importantly, it's trading at a reasonably low forward P/E ratio of less than 12, and is valued modestly below its reported book value. High-quality banks trading below their book value have often been a lure that's attracted Buffett. Comparatively, Morgan Stanley is valued about 60% above its book value."", ""Furthermore, MUFG is actually riding Morgan Stanley's coattails to massive profits since the financial crisis more than 15 years ago. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group purchased $9 billion worth of preferred stock in Morgan Stanley following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This stake in Morgan Stanley has consistently generated between 30% and 40% of MUFG's annual profits in recent years."", 'Why buy Morgan Stanley stock when Buffett can get exposure to Morgan Stanley via Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group at a fraction of the cost? I strongly believe MUFG to be the confidential stock Warren Buffett is buying at Berkshire Hathaway.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group wasn’t one of them.

Interest rates had jumped to record highs in the past two years because of rising prices as a result of post-pandemic demand pressures. According to estimates by the International Monetary Fund, global inflation is expected to drop to 5.2% in 2024, from a high of 8.7% in 2022.

Tightening policies by central banks around the world will limit money supplies. Research firm Deloitte claims that such a backdrop will create the conditions for divergent and sporadic economic growth, especially in the banking and financial sectors.\xa0', 'In the past few years, some of the best diversified banking stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co.

In 2022, banks in the US and Canada posted an 18% year-on-year increase in net interest income. Banks in Europe reported an 11% year-on-year increase in net interest income in the same year. High deposit costs are likely to remain a key area for concern in the banking world even as interest rates drop later this year.', 'In this overall environment, investors with banking stocks in their portfolios would be well-served by banking firms that have diversified sources of income. In mid-January, Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), highlighted during the fourth quarter earnings call some of the steps that her company was taking to diversify the business and keep pace with the rate of change in the finance world, stressing that realizing the synergies between the five businesses of the firm was one of the key drivers to achieving medium-term revenue targets.', '“We grew our tangible book value per share by 6% to $86.19 and we returned $6 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels. As I reflect on the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and for clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically and I’m very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times. 2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation. We expect to see growth slowing globally with the US well positioned to withstand a run-of-the-mill recession should one materialize. With a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and diligent risk management we are well positioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to path. Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths, given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures. 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our transformation. I recognize the importance of this year and I am highly confident that we will see the benefits of the actions we’ve taken through the momentum of our businesses.

This technology also helps reduce operating and fraud cost while freeing up cash flow for reinvestment in marketing to grow products (Venture X card) and build its brand. Periods of stress, like we saw in the banking sector during March, are a reminder of the underwriting acumen and high quality deposits of Capital One. We added to our position after the fallout, knowing that the company’s seasoned management team had steered capably through previous cycles. Today, as credit card delinquencies have risen to more normal levels, Capital One is already reporting a slowing in delinquency growth.

One could buy a brand-new flat-screen television, play the lottery, or keep it in a savings account. For people trying to increase their capital, though, investing in stocks easily beats out all three of those options -- provided, of course, that investors can pick the right companies to invest in.', ""For those with $1,000 to spare, let's consider two healthcare stocks worth investing in and holding onto for a long time: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) and HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA)."", ""One key to success for biotech companies is to constantly develop novel therapies that are superior to the existing standards of care. Vertex has mastered this art. The drugmaker markets the only medicines that address the underlying genetic causes of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare disease of the lungs. It isn't as though other companies haven't tried to crack this nut, but so far, all have failed."", ""That speaks volumes regarding Vertex's innovative abilities. The biotech has been rewarded for its troubles. Revenue, earnings, and free cash flow have increased rapidly."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals isn't slowing down, though. The company is still developing brand-new CF drugs. In February, the biotech reported phase 3 results from a new CF therapy, which showed non-inferiority when pitted against its current crown jewel, Trikafta. This new treatment also showed more significant reductions in sweat chloride (CF patients have higher levels of it) compared to Trikafta."", ""That was despite the newer medicine's convenient once-daily dosing -- Trikafta is taken twice a day. Besides improving its existing lineup, Vertex Pharmaceuticals also wants to treat those CF patients who aren't eligible for its current medicines. The company is working on that project, too. Elsewhere, the biotech is expanding its lineup. It earned approval for Casgevy, a gene editing therapy for a pair of blood diseases, late last year."", 'In January, it also reported positive late-stage results for its potential pain treatment, VX-548. There are several more candidates in mid and late-stage testing that should make meaningful progress in the next few years, leading to a transformed lineup and even stronger financial results in the next five to 10 years. At a price tag of about $414, $1,000 affords two shares.', ""HCA Healthcare is a leading hospital chain with facilities across much of the U.S. The company's business makes it hard for newcomers to pose a serious threat. Building dozens of medical facilities is hard enough. It involves jumping through various regulatory hoops and spending millions of dollars, but that's just step one. The next step is to build relationships with physicians, communities, and third-party payers. HCA Healthcare has already done all that."", ""That grants the company a serious advantage over new challengers. And even when pitted against existing competitors, HCA Healthcare has generally increased its market share. Between 2011 and 2022, it went from 23% to 28.5%. Naturally, HCA Healthcare's solid position has translated to strong financial results."", ""It hasn't always been smooth sailing; the pandemic disrupted occupancy levels and the number of procedures performed in its facilities, which are key components in HCA Healthcare's revenue formula. The subsequent economic issues also strained its expenses and squeezed the bottom line. However, HCA Healthcare has been able to bounce back for the most part. The headwinds it has encountered lately were highly unusual."", ""They won't substantially alter HCA Healthcare's progress over the long run. The demand for the company's services will only increase with an aging population that needs more medical care. So, HCA Healthcare's robust position in its industry should lead to solid returns over the long run. Shares are trading for just under $322 apiece -- investors can grab three of them with $1,000."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America.', 'While final figures for 2023 are still awaited, global military expenditure reached a record-high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). $961 billion of the total amount was incurred in the Americas, 94% of which was contributed by the United States and Canada.', 'In Latin America – the region comprising parts of North, South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean Islands where Romance languages are predominantly spoken – defense expenditure was measured at $57.2 billion in 2022, at a modest increase of 0.8% compared to 2021.', 'Brazil had the largest share of this expenditure, with over $20 billion spent on military expenses in 2022. The country has been leveraging its economic strength for quite some time now to upgrade its military. In 2014, Brasilia placed an order for 36 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden to enhance its aerial capabilities, for a deal valued at $5.04 billion. Four more jets were added to the contract in 2022. Six of these fighters have been received so far from Sweden, with the remaining set for delivery by 2027. A year earlier, the Brazilian Air Force provided a contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s subsidiary, Sikorsky, to provide logistics support for Brazil’s 16 UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters for a period of four years.\xa0', 'Argentina has also been investing heavily to strengthen its military. In June last year, the country ordered six Bell 407GXi helicopters from Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) to perform in critical search and rescue operations in the country’s mountainous terrains. Later in October, the United States approved the transfer of 24 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) F-16 fighter jets from Denmark to Argentina. According to Argentine newspaper La Nacion, these jets will be equipped with air-to-air missiles and paid for with a $40 million financing package.', 'The approval by Washington to provide Argentina with the F-16s is being seen by analysts as a move to counter Chinese influence in South America. Buenos Aires has been restricted from procuring western military hardware since the Falklands War with the UK in 1982. The Argentines had initially been considering replacing their Dassault Mirage III fighters, which retired back in 2015, with the JF-17 – a joint production of China and Pakistan.', 'In a similar manner, Colombia has been offered by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to upgrade and modernize its fleet of fighter jets with the F-16s to counter competing offers made by France’s Dassault Aviation and Swedish company Saab AB. The offer is reportedly backed by officials in Washington. Colombia is the fourth largest spender on defense in Latin America, having incurred over $9.9 billion on defense expenditure in 2022. The South American nation, in separate proposals, has also been offered to buy AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) for $225 million, and Harpoon anti-ship missiles from The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for $177 million.', 'We have considered various metrics to rank the most powerful militaries in Latin America. These include the size of their economy measured in terms of nominal GDP, countries’ defense spending, technological capabilities, number of active military personnel, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, military aircraft fleet, and total naval assets.', 'It was observed where countries ranked on each metric, and then accordingly, they were assigned scores. For instance, if a country ranked first on any given metric out of 25, it received a score of 1 (25/25), and if it ranked fifth, it got a score of 0.84 (21/25), and so on. Finally their individual scores for each metric were summed to get an overall score. The 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America are listed in this article in ascending order of their overall scores.', 'Data has been sourced from the 25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024, 20 Countries With Highest Military Spending In The World, 20 Largest Armed Forces in the World Ranked by Active Military Personnel, 15 Countries with the Most Battle Tanks in the World, 15 Militaries with the Most Armored Fighting Vehicles in the World, Global Firepower Index 2024 and Global Innovation Index 2023.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

It is the leading nonalcoholic ready-to-drink company on the face of the planet, with 2023 revenue of $46 billion. But that also means it's everywhere already, so where else can it go?"", ""These conflicting thoughts have some asking whether it's too late to buy Coca-Cola stock. Let's see if we can find an answer."", ""It's hard to understate Coca-Cola's dominance. With its popular product lineup that includes Coca-Cola, Sprite, Dasani, Minute Maid, Costa Coffee, Gold Peak Tea, Fanta, and Powerade, among many other brands, it has top market share. The company's products are sold at over 30 million retail locations."", ""Thanks to its long and successful history, Coca-Cola has built up a widely recognized brand. That supports its economic moat. Consumers are loyal and aren't likely to switch to products provided by competing firms. And this results in pricing power, a very attractive characteristic for a business."", ""The brand success also means Coca-Cola can execute some production actions competitors can't get away with. For instance, Much of its beverage production and distribution (including the costs) are handled by bottlers around the world it partners with. Coca-Cola just licenses the brands and provides the flavorings in many cases. This ends up being a huge cost-saving move for Coca-Cola. Consequently, it creates an extremely profitable enterprise. In the last decade, Coca-Cola's gross margin has averaged a superb 60.4%. This is better than other consumer favorites like Apple and Nike."", 'Given the mature nature of the industry, even after investing in growth initiatives, management has ample cash left over to return to shareholders. The company spent $2.3 billion on share buybacks last year. And it currently pays a dividend that yields 3.2%, which is enticing to income-seeking investors. That dividend has been raised consistently every year for more than 50 years, qualifying it as a Dividend King.', ""If you're looking for a mature and stable business to add to your portfolio, I don't think anyone would argue that Coca-Cola doesn't makes for a worthy investment candidate. But if you're someone looking to produce stronger returns over the long term, it's a different story."", ""In the last one-, three-, five-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year periods, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 on a total return basis (including dividends). That's not a great track record."", ""As of this writing, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.4. That's a slight premium to the S&P 500 at 23.1. Investors need to ask if it's worth paying an above-market valuation multiple for a business that consistently lags the large index."", ""Part of the reason Coca-Cola generates mediocre returns is that it has minimal growth potential. Revenue in 2023 was lower than it was in 2013. During this time, diluted earnings per share increased at a compound annual rate of 2.7%, respectively, in the past 10 years. It's difficult to think that these trends won't continue for the foreseeable future."", ""The executive team touts that only a small fraction of the world's population are customers. And they think that the business can get a boost by gaining a greater share in developed and emerging markets, as well as benefit from ongoing population growth."", ""However, investors shouldn't be optimistic that consumers' drinking habits are suddenly going to pick up significantly. Coca-Cola operates in a low-growth industry. It's not a high-flying tech enterprise attacking a massive and expanding market opportunity."", ""This is undoubtedly one of the world's most iconic brands.

At the same time, more than half of the 703 million people without basic drinking water resided in sub-Saharan Africa while a fifth belonged to Central and Southern Asia. 115 million people around the world still utilize surface water. Out of these, two-thirds of them lived in sub-Saharan Africa.', 'Water access in countries is influenced by income status. This is because only two-thirds of improved water sources are accessible in lower-middle-income countries. The situation in low-income nations is adverse since less than a third of these sources can be accessed on-premises.

Artificial intelligence is the story in technology now, driving the kind of growth that the company used to count on from selling its gadgets and services to eager consumers across the globe.', 'This has Apple investors in a quandary. Its revenue expansion is stagnating, and the stock is underperforming the Nasdaq 100 by about 16 percentage points, the most to start a year since 2013. The company still generates massive revenues, but whether that can keep increasing at the pace investors have come to expect is an open question. Apple executives say they have big plans for AI, which bulls hope will help revive growth. But so far it’s hard to gauge its prospects.', 'All of which has investors wondering, if Apple’s AI dreams don’t come to fruition, what is the role of the shares today?', '“It’s become more of a value stock, a bit like Coca-Cola,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management and chief market strategist at Osaic. “All the things you want that’s going to offer you a defensive profile and market rate returns for the foreseeable future until they have a new catalyst.”', 'Apple remains the reliable money machine it’s always been. It’s certainly a shareholder-friendly cash flow juggernaut, and a safe haven with a bulletproof balance sheet.', '“If you’re a long-term investor that really likes solid, stable growth, that’s very annuity like, with growing margins, improving profitability and a business that generates significant amounts of cash and still has lots of innovation runway, we think Apple is a great place to be,” said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.', 'But investors looking to buy into the next big growth market have turned their attention to AI. Nvidia Corp. is taking Apple’s place as the tech behemoth to own due to the seemingly insatiable demand for chips used to power large language models.', 'Valuation wipeout', 'Apple has fallen more than 10% this year, erasing around $330 billion in market capitalization, and ceding its position as the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft Corp., whose incorporation of ChatGPT into products like its Office software is starting to boost revenue growth. Microsoft now has a market value of almost $3.1 trillion versus Apple’s $2.7 trillion. Nvidia, whose revenue and profits have soared amid an arms race for AI computing power, isn’t far behind at $2.2 trillion.', 'Read More: Microsoft Dethrones Apple as Most Valuable Stock in the World', 'The problem isn’t so much that Apple has suddenly stopped growing, that’s been happening for a while — its revenue shrank in every quarter of its last fiscal year even as the stock was hitting records. The trouble is the company hasn’t shown anything on AI at a time when iPhones sales are sluggish and the company is facing mounting regulatory threats.', '“We’re going through an incredible wave of innovation,” said Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer at Citizens JMP Securities. “The market is telling you that Apple has a lot to prove here and to date they haven’t shown much.”', 'Notoriously secretive, Apple has divulged little about its plans to incorporate AI services into its products. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple would “break new ground” in AI this year and market professionals are anticipating big news at the company’s annual software developer’s conference in a few months. However, many investors are losing patience and turning to stocks with a clearer path in AI.', 'Read More: Apple Buys Canadian AI Startup as Part of Race to Add Features', 'At the core of Apple’s woes is the disappearance of revenue growth and it’s unclear what, if anything, will stoke it. The company’s first major new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro headset, isn’t expected to contribute significantly to growth for years. Apple recently pulled the plug on its long effort to build an electric car. At the same time iPhone revenue has stagnated and sales in China have dropped amid a weak economy and greater competition.', 'Regulatory pressures', 'On top of that Apple is facing mounting pressure from regulators. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about $2 billion by the European Union over an investigation into claims it blocked music-streaming rivals on its platforms. In the US, the Justice Department appears close to filing an antitrust lawsuit after five years of work building a case alleging Apple imposed software and hardware limitations on iPhones and iPads to impede competition from rivals.', 'Sales in fiscal 2023 fell 3% and are projected to rise just 2% in the current year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, revenue expanded at a 33% clip in 2021. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s sales are projected to jump 79% and Microsoft’s 15% in the companies’ current fiscal years.', 'For the past couple of years, Apple has commanded a premium valuation on par with Microsoft’s. Two years ago, when tech stocks got hit hard, the shares held up far better than those of its peers. But that’s no longer the case. Apple is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from about 30 times last summer. That’s similar to Walmart Inc.‘s valuation. Microsoft, meanwhile, is priced at 32 times and Nvidia at 35 times.', 'Read More: Apple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion Gift', 'That said, Microsoft trading at a record high may actually offer a good example of Apple’s long-term potential. When Satya Nadella took over the company in 2014 it was a software maker with a 20th century mindset and a languishing stock. Now it’s everywhere, from the cloud to AI, and its stock is soaring.', '“Everyone has to reinvent themselves, and it just shows you how quick the revolution in tech is,” Citizens JMP’s Lehmann said. “Microsoft finally got going, but it took them 15 years to figure it out.”', 'Despite this year’s gloomy performance, it’s easy to make the case that Apple shares are poised for a rebound and that it’s too early to count it out of the AI race. The company has more than $170 billion in cash on its balance sheet and its net income is expected to top $100 billion this year. That gives Apple unmatched resources to push into new markets and still return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.', '“It’s hard to not compare to what’s the hot thing right now,” Jensen Investment Management’s Walkush said. “If you took AI out of the picture right now, and the sensationalism, would people look at Apple differently?

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. To wit, the Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) share price has flown 126% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! Also pleasing for shareholders was the 23% gain in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.', ""After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'Valero Energy became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.', 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', 'We know that Valero Energy has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.', ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Valero Energy, it has a TSR of 154% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Valero Energy provided a TSR of 31% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 19%. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Valero Energy   you should know about."", 'But note: Valero Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

While that sort of growth rate isn't anything to write home about, it does show the business is growing."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Sherwin-Williams shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 14% to 16%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.', ""Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Sherwin-Williams' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", ""Since Sherwin-Williams has a market capitalisation of US$85b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$247m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", ""It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Sherwin-Williams, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m."", ""The Sherwin-Williams CEO received US$10m in compensation for the year ending December 2023. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making."", ""One important encouraging feature of Sherwin-Williams is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Sherwin-Williams, but the fun does not stop there. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'Although Sherwin-Williams certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

As the years pass, aging parents require care as well.', '""We\'re screwed,” Nooyi said. “We cannot have it all.""', 'At the Aspen event, Nooyi shared an unconventional tip for coping with the guilt of not being able to dedicate more time to her home life. Her daughter’s school hosted weekly Wednesday morning “class coffees” with students’ mothers. When her daughter got home, she would name all the mothers who were there: “You were not there, mom.”', '“The first few times, I would die with guilt, but I developed coping mechanisms,” Nooyi said. “I called the school and I said, give me a list of mothers who were not there.”', 'The next time her daughter brought up the class coffees, Nooyi listed off the other moms who didn’t show up. “I’m not the only bad mother,” she laughed.', 'Nooyi left PepsiCo in 2019 after 24 years with the company. Today, she serves on the boards of Amazon and the International Cricket Council. She has been celebrated for introducing design thinking and developing a culture of learning at PepsiCo—and being one of the first, and few, women of color to lead a Fortune 500 company.', '“Given my background and where I come from—crossing oceans as an immigrant, a person of color, a woman—ascending to lead this iconic company was a tough slog,” Nooyi told Fortune’s Emma Hinchliffe in 2022.', '“I’d love to see the most unusual, improbable people ascending to the top,” she continued. “Let’s give them the tools to move ahead.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Several analysts believe biotech in one area in the healthcare sector that is poised to benefit in 2024, considering the current performance of biotech stocks. However, certain areas within the biotech space may be risky as the trend of dealmaking and buyouts in the industry continues. As such, investors need to tread carefully if biotech is their preferred area of investment in 2024.', 'On February 28, Laura Chico, the Managing Director at Wedbush, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" to discuss this dealmaking trend in the biotech space and what it may mean for investors. Here are some of her comments:', '""I think this is a trend we\'ve been seeing a lot of this year, and even from the end of last year. So from December to now, we\'ve got over 11 over $35 billion in transactions. I don\'t think it\'s gonna stop anytime soon. Large-cap pharma biotechs do have exclusivity expiries that they have coming up, that they need to address.

Chico noted the following areas to keep an eye on as far as buyouts are concerned:', '""Obesity has been a really big theme in 2023, will probably continue for the foreseeable future, but across the area, at least in these recent M&A transactions, it\'s been really broad-based, and I think that\'s really a testament to the innovation in the space. We have a number of deals in oncology, immunology, inflammation, neuro, and even rare diseases. So it\'s not just within certain verticals at this point.""', ""According to Chico, investors looking to invest in biotech will surely do well by keeping up with FDA approval news, scientific and clinical risks posed by a company's products, and most importantly, what area of diseases a company is targeting with its products, as this may highlight its chances of success in terms of meeting an overlooked target population's needs alongside gaining FDA approval."", 'All things considered, biotech companies like\xa0Moderna, Inc.
