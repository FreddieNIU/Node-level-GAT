1,a1f61f97-fb05-30df-be63-23d5d5b0e7b8,SCHW,2022-11-30,Charles Schwab's (NYSE:SCHW) investors will be pleased with their notable 72% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwabs-nyse-schw-investors-120043727.html,1669809643,STORY,['SCHW'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which is up 65%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 25% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 5.0% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Charles Schwab achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Charles Schwab the TSR over the last 3 years was 72%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Charles Schwab shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 5.0% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 11% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Charles Schwab .Charles Schwab is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

2,9c5aca4c-74fb-36bb-bff9-19dcf42c2067,SCHW,2022-11-30,Is Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (FNDE) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-emerging-markets-large-112011675.html,1669807211,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (FNDE) made its debut on 08/13/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Broad Emerging Market ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $4.46 billion, this makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Broad Emerging Market ETFs. FNDE is managed by Charles Schwab. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Company Index (Net) ranks companies in the Russell Emerging Markets Index by measures of fundamental size and tracks the performance of those companies whose fundamental scores are in the top 87.5% of the Russell Emerging Markets Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.39% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.FNDE's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 5.48%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, China Construction Bank Corp H accounts for about 3.66% of the fund's total assets, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd.The top 10 holdings account for about 12.81% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF has lost about -16.90% so far, and is down about -11.91% over the last 12 months (as of 11/30/2022). FNDE has traded between $23.19 and $33.20 in this past 52-week period.FNDE has a beta of 0.73 and standard deviation of 24.11% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 381 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Emerging Market ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $63.54 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $67.90 billion. IEMG has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VWO charges 0.08%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Emerging Market ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This, in turn, will contribute well to its analog semiconductor business.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and ConsensusTexas Instruments Incorporated Price and ConsensusTexas Instruments Incorporated price-consensus-chart | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteBehind the HeadlinesThe new ADCs help maximize data communication speeds and reduce thermal resistance while developing small designs.With the launch of these ADCs, Texas Instruments positioned itself well to expand its presence in the booming analog-to-digital converters market, which is steadily benefiting from global technological advancements.Per an IMARC Group report, the global analog-to-digital converters market is expected to hit $3.3 billion by 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 5.4% between 2022 and 2027.The launch of the TPS7H5005-SEP PWM controllers remains a huge addition to TXN’s Space EP portfolio, as these support multiple power-supply topologies and field-effect transistor architectures.With TPS7H5005-SEP, Texas Instruments is well poised to capitalize on the prospects present in the growing PWM controllers’ market, which per a Future Market Insights report, is anticipated to reach $9.1 billion in 2022 and $15 billion by 2032, seeing a CAGR of 5.1% between 2022 and 2032.The growing prospects of Texas Instruments in the above-mentioned promising markets are likely to raise investor optimism on the stock in the days ahead.Shares of Texas Instruments have lost 6.1% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s decline of 38.2%.Story continuesAnalog Segment in FocusWith this latest move, Texas Instruments strengthens its analog segment offerings.The underlined segment is integral to Texas Instruments as it generates the majority of the total revenues.In the third quarter of 2022, the segment generated $3.99 billion revenues (76.2% of total revenues), up 13% from the year-ago quarter’s level.Therefore, Texas Instruments’ growing efforts toward expanding the analog segment are likely to continue driving its financial performance in the near and the long term.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Texas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Asure Software ASUR, Agilent Technologies A and AMETEK AME.

Its focus on acquisitions and solid balance-sheet strength augur well.Alexandria’s Class A properties are situated in the AAA innovation cluster locations of North America, with a significant market presence in Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. The advantageous locations of its properties have been driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.Alexandria has also been experiencing healthy leasing activity on the solid demand for its high-quality office/laboratory space. This has been aiding the company’s rental rate growth. Its total leasing activity aggregated 1.7 million RSF of space in the third quarter. For the third quarter, rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing of space was 27.1% and 22.6% (cash basis).Alexandria caters to a tenant base of more than 1,000 diversified high-quality companies ranging from multinational pharmaceutical, public and private biotechnology companies, life science products like enabling research tools and manufacturers of complex medicines to top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions. These ensure steady rental revenues for ARE.Further, to enhance its operating platform, Alexandria has been focusing on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations.In the third quarter, Alexandria completed acquisitions in its key life-science cluster submarkets totaling 1.2 million RSF of value-creation opportunities for a total price of $316.7 million. Also, ARE placed into service development and redevelopment projects totaling 332,961 RSF across multiple submarkets, which resulted in $30 million of incremental net operating income.Moreover, an encouraging development pipeline, with 5.6 million RSF of Class A properties undergoing construction as of Sep 30, 2022, bodes well for the company’s long-term growth.Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. The company had $6.4 billion of liquidity as of the end of the third quarter. It has no debt maturities prior to 2025. The weighted-average remaining term of debt as of Sep 30, 2022 was 13.2 years.ARE is known for consistently raising its dividend rates. In May 2022, the company announced a 2.6% hike in its first-quarter 2022 cash dividend to $1.18 per share. Also, Alexandria increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years.Over the last five years, the company has achieved average annual dividend per share growth of 6.5%. Based on Alexandria’s strong operating platform, robust financial position and lower payout ratio compared with the industry, the dividend rate is likely to be sustainable in the near term.However, Alexandria’s huge capital deployment for development and redevelopment activities exposes the company to the risks associated with rising construction costs and lease-up concerns.Further, rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 6.3% so far in the quarter, underperforming the industry’s growth of 7.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties Inc.

GIII and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.Story continuesBut there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 9 stocks that qualified the screening:Celestica is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services companies in the world, serving the computer and communications sectors.Celestica has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A.

(NYSE:TMO)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-thermo-fisher-120051228.html,1669809651,STORY,['TMO'],"[Let's talk about the popular Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Thermo Fisher Scientific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Worth?Thermo Fisher Scientific appears to be overvalued by 24% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$540 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $434.53. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like Thermo Fisher Scientific’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Thermo Fisher Scientific?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 28% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Thermo Fisher Scientific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in TMO’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe TMO should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TMO for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for TMO, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Thermo Fisher Scientific as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 17% year to date.But remember, Buffett also famously said to be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”Ultimately, no one is right 100% of the time.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger heavy demand for this physical asset — get in now before the super-rich swarmU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)As the parent company of U.S. Bank, U.S. Bancorp is one of the largest banking institutions in the country.As of Oct. 31, Berkshire owned 52,547,023 shares of U.S. Bancorp, or 3.5% of the bank’s total shares outstanding.While that’s still a sizable stake in a large financial institution, it’s down 56% from the 119,805,135 shares of U.S. Bancorp that Berkshire held at the end of June.U.S. Bancorp hasn’t been a hot commodity as the stock has tumbled 23% year to date.But interest rates are on the rise, and that could serve as a tailwind for banks.Banks lend money out at higher interest rates than they borrow, pocketing the difference. As interest rates increase, the spread earned by banks widens.Story continuesJPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja sees upside in U.S. Bancorp. The analyst has an ‘overweight rating’ on the bank and recently raised the price target to $47 — around 7% above the current levels.Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK)Bank of New York Mellon came into existence from the merger of The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial in 2007.Today, it stands as the world’s largest custodian bank, which safeguards clients’ financial assets.In Q3, Berkshire sold 10,146,575 shares of BNY Mellon, representing a 14% reduction. However, Buffett’s company still owned 62,210,878 shares of the custodian bank at the end of September, amounting to a 7.7% stake.Just like U.S. Bancorp, BNY Mellon hasn’t been a market darling — shares are also down 23% in 2022.But not everyone is turning bearish. Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz has a ‘buy’ rating on BNY Mellon and raised the price target from $46 to $50 after seeing the company’s Q3 results.Considering that BNY Mellon shares currently trade at around $44.90, the new price target implies a potential upside of 11%.Kroger (NYSE:KR)Berkshire also trimmed its stake in grocery giant Kroger in Q3, selling 2,168,472 shares.However, in an era where physical stores are under serious threat from online merchants, Kroger remains a brick-and-mortar beast.Shares of the supermarket chain are up 8% in 2022, in stark contrast to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s double-digit loss.The economy moves in cycles, but people always need to shop for food. As a result, Kroger can make money through our economy’s ups and downs.The company has expanded its online presence, too. Kroger’s digital sales in 2021 clocked in 113% higher compared to two years ago.You can see Kroger’s resilience in its dividend history: the company has increased its payout to shareholders for 16 consecutive years.Evercore ISI analyst Michael Montani recently upgraded Kroger from ‘in line’ to ‘outperform’ with a price target of $56 — implying a potential upside of 15% from where the stock sits today.What to read nextChances are good you're overpaying for home insurance.

Shriners Children's provides care and services regardless of the families' ability to pay or insurance status. While they can be found volunteering at any and all Shriners events - from fundraising golf tournaments to the East-West Shrine Bowl - a key component of their service is developing and facilitating leadership training for International Shriners members. The coursework they created ranges from how to develop a budget and become more active in the community to examining reputational risks.""That's really where the two things come together with the bank and our philanthropy,"" Matthew said. ""We're able to take what we do at the bank as leaders and project managers to influence a training program for Shriners.""While most people aren't on track to donate 1,000 hours of volunteer time in a year like the Sturlaugsons, U.S. Bank is encouraging everyone to give some time back on GivingTuesday - which falls on Nov. 29 this year. For the past six years, U.S. Bank has partnered with VolunteerMatch on its annual #GiveTimeSweepstakes campaign to inspire the community to share how they are giving back time during the holiday season. Throughout each year, U.S. Bank provides 16 hours of paid time off for employees.Matthew is a third-generation Shriner, joking that ""from my earliest memories I remember men in funny hats running around and having fun."" Starting in 2002, they both served in local leadership roles, including Matthew on the local board of directors in Fargo. After seven years, they turned their attention internationally on membership and leadership development.Story continuesMatthew is now serving his third of ten years as a member of the Board of Directors for Shriners International and Shriners Children's. This summer, he was elected Imperial Second Ceremonial Master, part of the 12-member body that helps govern the nearly 200,000-member Shriners fraternity.Much of their training is delivered in person to hundreds of people at a time, which means 12-hour days and weekends spent volunteering are commonplace for the Sturlaugsons. They typically catch a nighttime flight for their volunteering sessions with laptops in hand, working for the bank early in the morning and volunteering mid-day before returning to their work after. Matthew has been with the bank 26 years, and Mandii for 25 years. The two, in fact, met as colleagues in the mid-1990s at First Bank before it was purchased by U.S. Bank. They've since raised three kids.""We don't really take family vacations. Instead, we take every opportunity we can to involve our children - if we know we are travelling for a volunteer event, we take them with us,"" Mandii said. ""We want to make sure we are raising humble hearts, and it's a gift to us that we can involve them.""The Sturlaugsons unexpectedly experienced the Shriners as a patient family in 2018, when their youngest daughter, Gabriella, was diagnosed with scoliosis. She had been an avid competitive gymnast since kindergarten, and the diagnosis forced the heartbreaking decision for her to leave the sport early. She's receiving treatment at a Shriners Children's hospital, which has a world-renowned team of pediatric orthopedic providers, to help manage her scoliosis through a series of back braces.""People often ask us, ‘how can you give so much time to this philanthropy and still be employed?'"" Mandii said. ""Our response is that we are very proud of our employer for allowing us to be so flexible, and we make sure that our non-paying job never impacts our paying job. The opportunities the bank has provided for us to give back - I don't think we would've ever seen in any other organization.""Learn more about U.S. Bank hereU.S. Bank, Tuesday, November 29, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/729278/Making-Time-to-GiveTime-Back-to-the-Community]"

(CF) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-cf-industries-140002411.html,1669730402,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has lost 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, CF is expected to post earnings of $4.31 per share, indicating a change of +16.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.76 points to a change of +295.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -13.8%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.11 indicates a change of -9.9% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CF.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.86 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.5%. The $11.44 billion and $9.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +74.9% and -14.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:XYL)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-xylem-inc-103428026.html,1669804468,STORY,['XYL'],"[Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Xylem’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Xylem What Is Xylem Worth?Xylem appears to be overvalued by 20% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$110 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $91.43. This means that the opportunity to buy Xylem at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Xylem’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Xylem?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Xylem. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? XYL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology How Fast Is Microchip Technology Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In the last three years Microchip Technology's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates.

MCHP expects revenue growth despite continuing supply chain constraints still impacting the company’s operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.15 billion, representing year-over-year growth of about 22.5%.Microchip is facing severe backlogs. However, its recent growth in revenues can be attributed to the factor that Microchip is addressing certain key megatrends such as AI and ML and its strategic investments in high-growth, high-margin and high-cash-generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. In the last reported second quarter of 2022, net sales of $2.07 billion increased 25.7% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.52%.Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and ConsensusMicrochip Technology Incorporated Price and ConsensusMicrochip Technology Incorporated price-consensus-chart | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteMicrochip Addressing Megatrends for Organic GrowthThe entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to the macro-economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions. This has affected Microchip’s shares along with its peer, Analog Devices ADI.Microchip shares have fallen 14.6% in the year-to-date period (YTD) compared with the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry’s decline of 14.5%.ADI shares are down 6.7% in the YTD period even though it continues to enjoy solid demand for high-performance analog and mixed-signal solutions, which consistently impacted its revenue growth positively. Overall negative sentiment in the market made investors bearish on the stock.However, Microchip, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is one of the semiconductor sector companies, which is looking to benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act. This act supports investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduces dependence on foreign markets like China. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesMCHP’s peer, onsemi ON is already benefiting from the recent declaration of the act by the government.onsemi shares have inched up 3% in the YTD period, reflecting positive impacts from the newly-signed act and bullish investor sentiments as it provides returns in double digits in high-growth industries like automotive.The recently signed act by the Biden organization will see a boost of $52 billion in the U.S. chip industry and reduce its dependency on outside sources like China for manufacturing.This will help to reduce certain supply chain constraints faced globally and cut back on severe backlogs faced by the company and address high-margin key megatrends like AI and ML.Per Microchip, due to the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, the total port bandwidth for 400G (gigabits per second) and 800G is forecasted to grow at more than 50% annually. As a result, demand for 112G PAM4 connectivity is increasing beyond the cloud data center and telecom services to enterprise ethernet switching platforms.To meet the demand for better connectivity to address key megatrends such as AI and ML, which are at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution, Microchip is expanding its Ethernet PHY with the launch of its latest META-DX2+ Ethernet PHYs.However, as MCHP is looking to diversify its portfolio to address the growing need for increased bandwidth, other tech companies like Broadcom AVGO are also jumping at the opportunity.Broadcom also recently announced that it is launching its new Trident 4C Ethernet switch ASIC to address the growing security issues with increasing network bandwidth. Broadcom has been expanding its switch series for a while to address one of the most prevalent issues in the market currently, to accurately and securely handle growing network bandwidth.To diversify income from its microcontroller business riddled with supply-chain disturbances, Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business. These factors will enable Microchip to maintain sustainable revenue growth and expand its margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the study also found how employees viewed their pay was closely linked to how much they trust their organization.Company culture, inclusivity, work-life balance, and experiences within the organization have a bearing on employees’ trust and ultimately, their perception of how fairly they’re being paid. Those feelings also have a big impact on whether or not employees will stay at the company, or look for greener pastures, according to Gartner.Workers have always had feelings about their pay and their workplace, but the current confusing economy is bringing those to the forefront, according to the group.“Employees’ sensitivity to perceived pay gaps is being exacerbated by today’s economic conditions, including rising inflation, and the hot labor market, which is causing a shift in compensation between tenured employees and new hires,” Tony Guadagni, senior principal in the Gartner HR practice, said in a statement.The U.S. labor market has only recently started cooling down from what is commonly referred to as the Great Resignation—a period following the COVID pandemic when a huge number of people switched jobs, often for higher pay. That left employers chasing after new workers with generous pay raises, even as inflation trended upwards. That could often leave the employees who stayed at their jobs feeling left in the dust.Companies have actively been working to close some of those pay gaps, according to Gartner. One method has been by increasing compensation transparency. Greater communication and improved accountability are key to addressing the perception of pay equity, the organization says. A survey conducted by the group in May found that fewer than a third of employees know when their organization is prioritizing pay equity.“When organizations educate employees about how pay is determined, employee trust in the organization increases by 10%, and pay equity perceptions increase by 11%,” said Guadagni.The idea of pay transparency has become more popular in the U.S. over the last few years. In some states, companies are required to include salary ranges in their job postings as part of local pay transparency laws. Such regulations are already in effect in New York City and Colorado, and are on track to be implemented in the states of California and Washington in 2023. However, as soon as the New York law went into effect, companies were caught providing huge salary ranges for various jobs, making it relatively useless for job seekers.Story continuesThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraSam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each otherThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeSick with a new Omicron variant?

By the second week of June 2022, they peaked above $5 — a record high.Holiday Spending: Get Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsExplore: GOBankingRates’ Best Credit Cards for 2023It’s no secret why the price per gallon bottomed out in 2020. The pandemic turned the world’s highways into ghost roads, airports went dark and oil-thirsty factories closed their doors. The result was an unprecedented drop in demand.But what happened in 2022 that sent gas prices from $3.28 in January to $5 in June and then back to $3.65 today? Let’s check it out as part of our Year in Review.It All Started When the World Got Moving Again in 2021Gas prices are tied to oil prices, and the pandemic simultaneously disrupted the world’s oil supply chains and choked off demand. The result was a wash.“This kept gasoline and oil prices low as neither supply nor demand outpaced each other,” said Luke Williams, a finance expert with ExpertInsuranceReviews.com. “As the nation emerged from the pandemic, demand for gasoline rose as more consumers started traveling again.”That was in the early spring of 2021, and as roads, skies and factories came back to life, the price per gallon jumped from $2.41 in February to $2.90 in May to $3.17 in August to $3.35 in December.By the time the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve, the post-pandemic demand surge had already sent the price per gallon on an upward trajectory heading into 2022.Take Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?In February, a Global Energy Giant Went to WarThe U.S. produces more oil than any country on Earth. The world’s second-largest oil-producing country is Russia, and on Feb. 24, Russia upended the global status quo by invading neighboring Ukraine.The world expressed its outrage by hitting Russia where it hurt the most — in its energy exports.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted economic sanctions from all over the world,” said Williams. “Given that Russia is one of the world’s top fuel suppliers, such sanctions restricted the global supply of oil, raising prices even more as a result.”Story continuesThe impact was immediate.Russia launched its attack at the end of February when the average price per gallon was $3.61. A month later in the last week of March, it was $4.23, then $4.60 by the end of May en route to $5 in June.A String of Incidents Made High Gas Prices Feel InevitableIn 2021, President Biden put the final nail in the coffin of Keystone XL, a proposed 1,200-mile, $9 billion pipeline that would have shuttled 830,000 barrels of oil sands crude from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska. Biden revoked a key permit, canceling the project for good after 12 years of legal wrangling between TC Energy and U.S. landowners, Native American tribes and environmentalists.The outcome had no impact on gas prices, but Keystone proponents circulated misinformation to the contrary and the general public came to believe that the cost of fuel would rise because the pipeline was canceled.Around the same time, hackers temporarily shut down the Colonial Pipeline in the biggest cyberattack on critical infrastructure in American history. That, too, was accompanied by doomsday media coverage that warned consumers to brace for higher gas prices.A few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine and the public came to accept that record-high gas prices were inevitable in the near future.Consumers Expected High Gas Prices — and Big Oil Didn’t DisappointWhile there were some legitimate issues with production and supply, it’s now clear that the oil industry used the public’s pessimistic expectations and the cover of general inflation to keep prices artificially high.Shell, Exxon, Chevron, BP and TotalEnergies announced record profits of more than $50 billion in both the second and third quarters of 2022 — more than double the profits of a typical quarter. Their record haul directly coincided with the time that gas prices peaked at their highest point.Big energy wasn’t the only industry that fleeced consumers under the guise of inflation in 2022, but no other industry’s price gouging was as egregious.“Oil companies have been some of the top culprits of this practice,” said Collin Plume, a 20-year financial services industry veteran and CEO of Noble Gold Investments. “The Biden administration is threatening to impose a windfall tax on big oil if they don’t use their recent gains to increase production and lower prices at the pump. With a now divided Congress, it remains to be seen if such policies could pass.”Expect Prices To Remain in the Mid-$3 Range Next YearAfter peaking in June, the average price per gallon fell every single day for nearly two months before settling under $4 in mid-August. The decrease coincided with a global drop in the price of crude oil, which was welcome news for consumers and the economy as a whole.High gas prices can drive inflation more than any other commodity because just about everything travels by truck at one point or another, and sellers have to compensate for the increased cost of shipping. When gas prices rise, everything from laptops to lettuce gets more expensive right along with it.As of late November, the average nationwide price per gallon is $3.62, and you shouldn’t expect things to change too much in the new year. The Energy Information Administration predicts the average price per gallon will be $3.57 in 2023 compared to $4.05 in 2022.Of course, you should keep in mind that the EIA’s projections are just one war or pandemic away from becoming wishful thinking.More From GOBankingRatesTop 10 Richest People in the WorldGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings Tips5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00010 Things to Do Now If Your Credit Score Is Under 700This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Gas Prices in 2022: All the Changes That Impacted Americans’ Finances This Year]"

Two of those tankers, including the Young Yong, were designated this month by U.S. authorities for violating sanctions on Iran, one of Venezuela's closest allies.Six shipping and oil trading specialists told Reuters the use of false documents to conceal cargoes originating in sanctioned countries including Venezuela and Iran has increased compliance risks for oil and trading companies, amid a proliferation of international sanctions. ""It's now becoming clear you cannot trust certificates of origin even when they come with official government documentation,"" said Cari Stinebower, a U.S.-based partner with law firm Winston &amp; Strawn, who advises oil and trading companies how to comply with sanctions. The Young Yong was one of several tankers named by the U.S. Treasury on Nov. 3 as part of a ""smuggling network"" that has used forged documentation to ship Iranian oil to finance Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah. The Treasury designated the tanker as a frozen asset and placed its owner, Marshall Islands-registered Technology Bright, under sanctions. The U.S. Treasury declined to comment on the involvement of the Young Yong or the other vessels identified by Reuters in shipping Venezuelan crude. Stinebower, who previously worked as a legal counsel for the U.S. Treasury's sanctions enforcement arm OFAC, said the use of false documents to conceal the origin of cargoes was pioneered by Iran to avoid U.S. sanctions. Citing cases she has worked on as a commercial lawyer, Stinebower said it appeared the technique was now being adopted to transport Venezuelan oil but she declined to provide further details.Story continuesVenezuela's oil ministry and state-owned oil company PDVSA did not respond to requests for comment. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York also did not respond to Reuters questions. PDVSA documents reviewed by Reuters said a vessel named the Comuna loaded 1.98 million barrels of oil in the Venezuelan port of Jose from May 11 to 21 last year.However, independent monitoring company TankerTrackers.com, which specializes in analyzing vessel movements for insurance and shipowners' research, used satellite images and photos to identify the tanker as the Young Yong.The images show the vessel's name had been painted over but the tanker is identifiable because of the distinctive white arches flanking its bridge, the position of the cranes on its deck and the shape of its funnel, said Samir Madani, TankerTrackers.com's owner.When the Young Yong set sail from Venezuela after loading the oil, its location transmitter showed it departing from the West African port of Lome.The Young Yong then stopped near Malaysia between early July and August 2021. While there, on July 8, it obtained a quality certificate from Singapore-based laboratory Saybolt that identified its cargo as Malaysian heavy crude – which has similar characteristics to Venezuela's Merey 16 crude grade. The certificate measures aspects of oil - such as its density and its levels of sulfur and metals - that allow a buyer to be sure a cargo is within a contract's specifications.Saybolt's U.S. owner, Core Laboratories N.V., said in a statement to Reuters that it had certified the crude as Malaysian heavy oil blend based on documentation it received from the client and its analysis of the quality of the oil. The company said it had no reason to doubt this was the case. It did not identify who the client was.The quality certificate was shared with Reuters by advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which tracks shipments potentially violating sanctions.Shipping database Equasis listed contact details for the Young Yong's owner Technology Bright as care of Hong Kong-based East Wind Ship Management. A Reuters reporter could not find East Wind Ship Management at the address listed in the database nor find a contact elsewhere to seek comment. Reuters was unable to identify the buyer of the oil in China.Indonesian authorities said in early November that the Young Yong had run aground off the Riau Islands on Oct. 26. UANI said it was carrying Venezuelan fuel oil when it ran aground and was likely trying to reach Nipah, a popular ship-to-ship transfer hub near Indonesian waters, according to satellite pictures and vessel tracking, analyzed by the advocacy group.UNSUCCESSFUL SANCTIONSChristian M. Ingerslev, chief executive of Maersk Tankers, said the proliferation of sanctions had led to ""separate fleets and separate markets run in parallel"": some vessels were operating off-the-radar to service sanctioned countries, sometimes without proper insurance, he said.London-headquartered ship broker Braemar PLC estimated that the total fleet servicing Iran and Venezuela, despite U.S. sanctions, consists of more than two hundred tankers, including some 82 supertankers like the Young Yong that can carry up to two million barrels of oil each.The United States imposed oil trading sanctions on Venezuela in 2019 after calling Maduro's re-election the previous year a sham. Washington has maintained pressure on the socialist leader to hold fair elections and release political prisoners: it said last week it could relax sanctions if there is progress in talks between Maduro's government and the opposition.The use of a wide array of tactics - including false documentation, fake vessel names and ship-to-ship transfers of cargoes at sea - has enabled Venezuela to export more than 360 million barrels of crude and fuel since the imposition of U.S. sanctions, according to Reuters calculations based on PDVSA's internal documents and ship tracking data.That represents more than two-thirds of Venezuela's total oil exports from 2019 through October 2022. The remainder went either directly to its ally Cuba or to other destinations in the Caribbean and Europe under exemptions to U.S. sanctions, according to the Reuters calculations.PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment on those figures. When asked about Reuters' findings about the use of false documentation by vessels carrying Venezuelan crude, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said: ""our Venezuela sanctions remain in effect"".PDVSA documents from May 2021 listed Yunshu Maritime Ltd as the charterer of the Comuna – the name used by the Young Yong to load Venezuela crude that month. The PDVSA shipping documents and invoices for the cargo dated September 2021 did not provide contact details for Yunshu Maritime. Reuters was unable to find a website or address for the company.Yunshu Maritime was also the charterer for another supertanker that loaded Venezuelan oil in May 2021 under the name Joy, PDVSA's loading schedules showed. Using satellite images and photos, TankerTrackers.com identified that vessel as the Panamanian-flagged tanker Adisa, which was also blacklisted this month by the U.S. Treasury for transporting Iranian oil.The Treasury said the vessel is controlled by a company owned by Viktor Artemov, a Ukrainian national who oversees a network of cover companies used to sell sanctioned Iranian oil and channel the proceeds to the Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah.Artemov, who has been placed under U.S. sanctions, did not respond to requests for comment.The Treasury named the Adisa's owner as Triton Navigation Corp, which is listed on Equasis as care of Thomarose Global Ventures. Reuters was unable to locate Nigeria-based Thomarose Global Ventures for comment.The Adisa set its location signal to make it appear that it set sail from Africa in early June 2021 with Malaysia as its destination. The vessel made a stop in Malaysia between July and early September and then switched its transponder off for about a week before reappearing near Qingdao in mid-September, where it discharged, according to ship tracking data.However, a bill of lading for the Adisa dated June 3, 2021 and issued by West Atlantic Port Services in Togo said the vessel had loaded 1.89 million barrels of West African blended heavy crude oil, according to the document reviewed by Reuters. West Atlantic Port Services did not answer phone calls for comment.(Additional reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Matt Spetalnick in Washington and Michelle Nichols in New York; Editing by Daniel Flynn)]"

By the second week of June 2022, they peaked above $5 — a record high.Holiday Spending: Get Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsExplore: GOBankingRates’ Best Credit Cards for 2023It’s no secret why the price per gallon bottomed out in 2020. The pandemic turned the world’s highways into ghost roads, airports went dark and oil-thirsty factories closed their doors. The result was an unprecedented drop in demand.But what happened in 2022 that sent gas prices from $3.28 in January to $5 in June and then back to $3.65 today? Let’s check it out as part of our Year in Review.It All Started When the World Got Moving Again in 2021Gas prices are tied to oil prices, and the pandemic simultaneously disrupted the world’s oil supply chains and choked off demand. The result was a wash.“This kept gasoline and oil prices low as neither supply nor demand outpaced each other,” said Luke Williams, a finance expert with ExpertInsuranceReviews.com. “As the nation emerged from the pandemic, demand for gasoline rose as more consumers started traveling again.”That was in the early spring of 2021, and as roads, skies and factories came back to life, the price per gallon jumped from $2.41 in February to $2.90 in May to $3.17 in August to $3.35 in December.By the time the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve, the post-pandemic demand surge had already sent the price per gallon on an upward trajectory heading into 2022.Take Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?In February, a Global Energy Giant Went to WarThe U.S. produces more oil than any country on Earth. The world’s second-largest oil-producing country is Russia, and on Feb. 24, Russia upended the global status quo by invading neighboring Ukraine.The world expressed its outrage by hitting Russia where it hurt the most — in its energy exports.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted economic sanctions from all over the world,” said Williams. “Given that Russia is one of the world’s top fuel suppliers, such sanctions restricted the global supply of oil, raising prices even more as a result.”Story continuesThe impact was immediate.Russia launched its attack at the end of February when the average price per gallon was $3.61. A month later in the last week of March, it was $4.23, then $4.60 by the end of May en route to $5 in June.A String of Incidents Made High Gas Prices Feel InevitableIn 2021, President Biden put the final nail in the coffin of Keystone XL, a proposed 1,200-mile, $9 billion pipeline that would have shuttled 830,000 barrels of oil sands crude from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska. Biden revoked a key permit, canceling the project for good after 12 years of legal wrangling between TC Energy and U.S. landowners, Native American tribes and environmentalists.The outcome had no impact on gas prices, but Keystone proponents circulated misinformation to the contrary and the general public came to believe that the cost of fuel would rise because the pipeline was canceled.Around the same time, hackers temporarily shut down the Colonial Pipeline in the biggest cyberattack on critical infrastructure in American history. That, too, was accompanied by doomsday media coverage that warned consumers to brace for higher gas prices.A few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine and the public came to accept that record-high gas prices were inevitable in the near future.Consumers Expected High Gas Prices — and Big Oil Didn’t DisappointWhile there were some legitimate issues with production and supply, it’s now clear that the oil industry used the public’s pessimistic expectations and the cover of general inflation to keep prices artificially high.Shell, Exxon, Chevron, BP and TotalEnergies announced record profits of more than $50 billion in both the second and third quarters of 2022 — more than double the profits of a typical quarter. Their record haul directly coincided with the time that gas prices peaked at their highest point.Big energy wasn’t the only industry that fleeced consumers under the guise of inflation in 2022, but no other industry’s price gouging was as egregious.“Oil companies have been some of the top culprits of this practice,” said Collin Plume, a 20-year financial services industry veteran and CEO of Noble Gold Investments. “The Biden administration is threatening to impose a windfall tax on big oil if they don’t use their recent gains to increase production and lower prices at the pump. With a now divided Congress, it remains to be seen if such policies could pass.”Expect Prices To Remain in the Mid-$3 Range Next YearAfter peaking in June, the average price per gallon fell every single day for nearly two months before settling under $4 in mid-August. The decrease coincided with a global drop in the price of crude oil, which was welcome news for consumers and the economy as a whole.High gas prices can drive inflation more than any other commodity because just about everything travels by truck at one point or another, and sellers have to compensate for the increased cost of shipping. When gas prices rise, everything from laptops to lettuce gets more expensive right along with it.As of late November, the average nationwide price per gallon is $3.62, and you shouldn’t expect things to change too much in the new year. The Energy Information Administration predicts the average price per gallon will be $3.57 in 2023 compared to $4.05 in 2022.Of course, you should keep in mind that the EIA’s projections are just one war or pandemic away from becoming wishful thinking.More From GOBankingRatesTop 10 Richest People in the WorldGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings Tips5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00010 Things to Do Now If Your Credit Score Is Under 700This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Gas Prices in 2022: All the Changes That Impacted Americans’ Finances This Year]"

This will make it possible for newly acquired gold to be behind user investments.The project is technically sound thanks to its advanced infrastructure and a clear vision for the future, enabling good returns for investors who believe in the project. The firm overseeing the undertaking is a syndicate with interests in diverse industries in countries across the globe.

Its numerous applications are poised to elevate gold-backed digital currencies to the next level. They have already started their exploration effort and expect to find somewhere in the range of 100 and 500 tons of gold. With token holders being rewarded with half of the resources.

The donation will focus on the area where its exploration project is located to benefit the locals and surrounding ecological diversity.

(NYSE:CRM) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 79% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-favoured-130013257.html,1669813213,STORY,['CRM'],"[Every investor in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Salesforce, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Salesforce. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Salesforce. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.9% and 4.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Marc Benioff directly holds 2.8% of the total shares outstanding.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$4.8b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Salesforce. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

Wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph are possible on Thursday. Another weather system may move into the state over the weekend with more unsettled weather.Ahead of storms, PG&amp;E stockpiles power poles, powerlines, transformers and other electric equipment at yards throughout our service territory in preparation to restore power to affected areas safely and as quickly as possible.If needed, local PG&amp;E operations emergency centers will activate in impacted regions to more efficiently allocate crews, materials and other resources to restoration efforts. PG&amp;E routinely practices its preparedness and response to storms and other emergencies through company exercises and drills with local first responders.""As with any wintry weather event, there is the potential of power outages due to rain, gusty winds and mountain snow. Our meteorology team has been tracking this weather system and is coordinating with our Electric Operations to ensure the company is prepared to respond to outages. It’s always important for our customers to have an emergency plan in place for themselves and their families, too,"" said Evan Duffey, a PG&amp;E meteorologist.Wet and windy conditions could cause trees, limbs and other debris to fall into powerlines, damage equipment and interrupt electric service. PG&amp;E vegetation management crews work year-round to keep trees away from powerlines.Story continuesPG&amp;E’s meteorology team utilizes a Storm Outage Prediction Model that incorporates real-time weather forecasts, historical data and system knowledge to accurately show where and when storm impacts will be most severe. This model enables the company to pre-stage crews and equipment as storms approach to enable rapid response to outages.Keeping Customers InformedPG&amp;E knows how important it is to keep its customers informed. Customers can view real-time outage information on its website outage center and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email or phone. PG&amp;E will let customers know the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power has been restored.Storm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer during an outage to prevent foods from spoiling.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns. Turn your appliances back on one at a time when conditions return to normal.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: Safety and Preparedness, Storm Safety, and Safety Action CenterAbout PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Instead, with the housing market beginning a gradual adjustment that could last through 2025, what next year will offer buyers is less competition for a growing number of for-sale homes.Homebuying Costs Aren't Coming Down in 2023Overall in 2023,1 Realtor.com® forecasts that buyers and sellers can expect:Average mortgage rates of 7.4%, with early 2023 hikes followed by a slight retreat to 7.1% by year-end.Home sales prices won't come down, but growth will moderate to a single-digit yearly pace (+5.4%) for the first time since 2020.Rents (+6.3% year-over-year) will outpace home prices and likely hit new highs, further adding to budget pressures – especially for first-time buyers.An increase in existing homes for sale (+22.8% year-over-year), as the inventory refresh that began last summer accelerates.Home sales will decline 14.1% year-over-year to 4.53 million, the lowest level since 2012 (see table below).""Compared to the wild ride of the past two years, 2023 will be a slower-paced housing market, which means drastic shifts like price declines may not happen as quickly as some have anticipated. It will be a challenging year for both buyers and sellers, but an important one in setting the stage for home sales to return to a sustainable pace over the next two to three years,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""With mortgage rates continuing to climb as the Fed navigates the economy to a soft-ish landing, higher costs will lead to fewer closings, but that doesn't mean homebuying will stop entirely in 2023. Americans who are determined to make a move will find that staying up-to-date on the market, flexibility, creativity and a healthy dose of patience will go a long way toward success in the year ahead.""Story continuesKey 2023 housing trends and wildcards A second wind in the second half. Although home sales are expected to slow overall in 2023, Realtor.com®'s forecast points to the possibility of a second wind in buying activity in the second half of the year. With mortgage rate hikes projected to continue through March, the Spring season will likely be less busy than in a typical year as buyers and sellers recalibrate their expectations around smaller budgets. This break could provide space for demand to renew as mortgage rates dip later in the year, when home shoppers will also have more options and bargaining power.A trifecta of budget barriers awaits buyers. In 2023, incomes are expected to grow (+3.9%), but not enough to offset higher mortgage rates (7.4%) and home prices (+5.4%), creating a trifecta of budget barriers. The typical monthly mortgage payment will be $2,430, 28% higher than in 2022, which will likely price many home shoppers out of the market. This will especially be a concern for first-time buyers. As rents will likely reach new highs, it will leave less room for saving towards a down payment. At the same time, some home shoppers may consider exploring new financial options like adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), a trend that has already begun to take shape in 2022.It isn't '08. During the mid-2000s housing boom, home sales were elevated for more than five years, and it took another five years for home sales to recover from the economic aftermath. Comparatively, mortgage rate hikes have brought a quicker but less dramatic end to the recent frenzy, during which buyers have been better qualified than in '08. Moving forward, home price growth will slow and may even decline periodically as prices largely stabilize over the next two-to-three years. The homeownership rate is predicted to hold in 2023.Some homeowners could still make bank. In 2023, the typical homeowner is projected to gain $25,650 in equity as prices keep rising. With real estate wealth already much higher than pre-COVID, these trends offer a positive reality check for sellers who have been increasingly pessimistic about entering the market as listing prices have pulled back from last year's peak. While bidding wars won't be the norm in 2023, sellers who have owned their home for a longer period of time are still likely to make a profit. And those living in relatively affordable areas may still command offers above asking, driven by continued home shopper interest in relocating to lower-priced markets.2023 puts the ""wild"" in wildcards: Political and economic events can always shake up the housing outlook, as was the case with major financial shifts in 2022. Along with factors including supply chain disruptions and the conflict in Ukraine, markets have largely begun to adjust for these changes, such as with the Fed's efforts to combat inflation with rate hikes. As such, forecasted 2023 housing trends don't anticipate a major shakeup like a recession, but it's still a possibility. Buyers and sellers should keep an eye out for risk signs like a substantial weakening in the jobs market, beyond the mild uptick in unemployment that is projected, as businesses are potentially disrupted by shifting geopolitical, financial and economic conditions. Although a potential recession may lead to lower mortgage rates, ultimately buyers' purchasing power would suffer. And for sellers, this would likely mean less demand and potential price drops.""Of the many factors that are expected to affect the housing market in 2023, affordability tops the list of issues most likely to make or break buyers' plans. Still, our forecast does offer promise for home shoppers who are well-prepared.

63,4bb9e536-44ba-3080-bcbb-f2ed9ca950d2,MRO,2022-11-30,Estimating The Fair Value Of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-marathon-oil-191550613.html,1669749350,STORY,['MRO'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Marathon Oil Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.45bUS$2.83bUS$1.85bUS$1.48bUS$1.28bUS$1.17bUS$1.11bUS$1.07bUS$1.05bUS$1.04bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ -19.98%Est @ -13.39%Est @ -8.78%Est @ -5.55%Est @ -3.29%Est @ -1.71%Est @ -0.6% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$3.2kUS$2.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.1kUS$837US$701US$608US$540US$487US$445(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.0%) = US$15bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$15b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$6.5bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$18b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$29.8, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Oil as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.352. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Marathon Oil, we've put together three essential factors you should further examine:Risks: Be aware that  Marathon Oil is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored...Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for MRO's future outlook?

From our perspective, the two investor concerns go hand in hand.""The Microsoft logo on the screen prior to games in BIG3 Week Three at Comerica Center on July 03, 2022 in Frisco, Texas. (Photo by Tim Heitman/Getty Images for BIG3)However, Weiss's research found that demand for Microsoft remains solid.""Digging deeper, there are multiple factors leading us to believe the commercial business should be more durable than feared for Microsoft, despite the near term macro pressures,"" the analyst said.He listed these as:""Demand signals remain positive, with management conversations, earnings commentary, channel work, and our CIO survey supporting 20% commercial growth.""Operating expenses should normalize into the back half of fiscal year 2023: ""Although operating expenses continued to rise into 2QFY23, this is largely due to prior hiring, M&amp;A and rising compensation expenses exiting FY22. With a pause in hiring, operating expense growth should moderate significantly in the back half as we anniversary the more aggressive hiring – we model 15% year over year operating expense growth in 1HFY23 dropping to 8% year over year in 2HFY23.""""Several revenue tailwinds heading into 2HFY23. Less onerous incremental foreign exchange impacts so far this quarter, which should fade further into the back half, ramping O365 pricing benefits, as well as, easier comparisons for Windows OEM, Office Commercial, LinkedIn and Dynamics heading into 2HFY23 should all support more robust top line growth.""""Valuation remains favorable. At ~20x2024 EPS, or ~1.2x 2 years price-to-earnings growth, Microsoft trades at a discount to its historical trading range, other large cap software peers, as well as other mega-cap tech names.""Story continuesThis chart from Weiss underscores that the demand backdrop for a leader such as Microsoft is still solid.Not all tech investments are being cut back.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

More importantly, all three have garnered substantial support from Wall Street with a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Let’s see what the analysts like about them.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Hardly any companies come bigger than Microsoft, the first Dow stock we’ll look at. It is the second biggest company in the world by market cap, the tech giant being a home and office computing pioneer, having built its empire on the ubiquitous MS Windows operating system and its business apps suite for PCs, MS Office.But the company has branched out from there and now encompasses everything from cloud computing (Azure) to gaming (Xbox) and along the way there have been some huge acquisitions that have widened its remit, the biggest of which have been gaming giant Activision Blizzard ($69 billion - expected to close next year), networking site Linkedin ($26 billion), and cloud and AI software company Nuance ($19.7 billion), with plenty of others trailing behind.Story continuesThe tough economic backdrop has weighed on all and sundry this year, but despite the ongoing headwinds, Microsoft still managed to deliver a positive set of financial metrics in its latest quarterly report – for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (September quarter). Revenue climbed by 10.6% year-over-year to $50.1 billion while the company delivered EPS of $2.35, marking a modest y/y increase of 3.5%. Both results bettered Street expectations.However, the company warned of trouble ahead due to the precarious state of the global economy. For the December quarter, Microsoft guided for revenue between $52.4 billion and $53.4 billion, some distance below the Street’s expectation of $56.1 billion.Investors might have shown their disappointment and the shares might be down by 27% year-to-date, but Argus analyst Joseph Bonner sees plenty of reasons to keep on backing a company he believes “may just hold the premiere position in business technology.”“Although obviously not immune from macroeconomic factors, Microsoft has about as diversified and strong a set of assets as any company in the Technology industry -- and may even be looked at as a haven by investors looking for a flight to quality in uncertain times and market conditions,” Bonner explained. “The company is one of a few with a complete and integrated product set aimed at enterprise efficiency, cloud transformation, collaboration, and business intelligence. It also has a large and loyal customer base, a large cash cushion, and a rock-solid balance sheet.”Accordingly, Bonner rates MSFT shares a Buy, while his $371 price target implies ~53% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Bonner’s track record, click here)Overall, there’s no doubts on Wall Street that the bulls are running with MSFT; the stock’s 29 recent analyst reviews break down 26 to 3 in favor of Buys over Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $242.02 and have an average target of $295.38, which indicates room for ~22% growth in the year ahead. (See MSFT stock forecast on TipRanks)The Walt Disney Company (DIS)Does Walt Disney really need an introduction? The entertainment behemoth’s reputation precedes it, and the company is not known as the Content King for nothing. Disney’s offerings span everything from its world-famous theme parks to its film studio division Walt Disney Studios (which counts amongst its roster the Walt Disney Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Searchlight Pictures), cable television networks including the Disney Channel, ESPN, and National Geographic, and the Disney+ streaming service.Despite all the above, Disney has been going through some tough times. The company took a big hit during the pandemic, what with shuttered theme parks, closed movie theaters, and halts to live action productions. And recently, the global economic woes have made their presence felt. In fact, the troubles have been so acute, they have ushered in the recent and unexpected return of former CEO Bob Iger, called upon to turn Disney’s fortunes around.Iger took hold of the reins following a woeful fiscal fourth quarter report (October quarter). While revenue increased by 8.7% year-over-year to $20.15 billion, that figure fell short of Street expectations by $1.29 billion. Likewise on the bottom-line, the company delivered adj. EPS of $0.30, some distance below the $0.56 anticipated by the analysts.On a bright note, the company did add 12.1 million Disney+ subscribers, way above the 9.3 million additions anticipated on Wall Street. Disney+ is part of the company’s DTC (direct to consumer) business, a segment which Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth believes can propel the company forward.“DTC remains a key growth opportunity, with DIS’s DTC services adding nearly 57 million subscriptions this year for a total of over 235 million,” the 5-star analyst said. “Content is King, and DIS is the King of Content, which continues to drive its flywheel of growth. DIS’s strong brand equity, innovative entertainment development capabilities, and ongoing investments in new digital media development initiatives will drive greater Return on Capital, increasing Economic Profit, and long-term gains in shareholder value creation.”To this end, Feinseth rates DIS a Buy while his Street-high $177 price target suggests the shares will climb 85% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Feinseth’s track record, click here)Most analysts agree with Feinseth’s thesis; the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 17 Buys vs. 3 Holds. The average target stands at $122.25, making room for 12-month growth of ~28%. (See Disney stock forecast on TipRanks)Visa Inc. (V)The last Dow stock we’ll look at is a giant of a different kind. Visa is a global payments leader and amongst the world's most valuable companies. Instead of issuing cards, extending credit, or establishing rates and fees for consumers, what Visa actually does is give financial institutions access to payment products bearing the Visa brand, which they can use to offer credit, debit, prepaid, and cash access services to their clients. Its network enables digital payments in more than 200 countries and territories and has facilitated 255.4 billion transactions with a total volume of $14 trillion in the 12 months leading up to June 2022.While Visa volumes and revenues went through a lull during the pandemic, they have been rising steadily since, as was the case again in the recently reported fiscal fourth quarter statement (September quarter). Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, amounting to a 19% increase on the same period last year, while beating the Street’s forecast by $250 million. Likewise, adj. EPS of $1.93 trumped the $1.86 anticipated by the analysts. At the same time, the board raised Visa's quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.45 a share and gave the go ahead for a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program.That is the sort of performance and activities which have shielded the stock from much of 2022’s carnage (the shares are down by only 2.5% in 2022).Assessing Visa’s prospects, Morgan Stanley’s James Faucette believes that even in the event of a recession, the company should be “well protected.”Explaining his bullish stance, Faucette writes: “V is one of our preferred stocks, as it is a key beneficiary of resilient global consumer spend growth, the ongoing shift from cash to electronic payments, and broadening merchant acceptance… We see upside opportunity from faster-than expected recovery of travel and the sustained strength of cross-border ecommerce. Continued investment in longer term initiatives (faster payments, P2P, B2B) and partnerships continue to increase its TAM and offer an opportunity for compounding double digit earnings growth for the foreseeable future.”It's no wonder, then, that the 5-star analyst rates V shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy) while his $284 price target could deliver returns of 34% over the course of the next year. (To watch Faucette’s track record, click here)That bullish sentiment is mirrored by the rest of the Street’s take; while one analyst remains on the sidelines, all 17 other recent analyst reviews are positive, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month gains of ~17%, considering the average target stands at $246.33.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Starbucks Is Starbucks Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.62bUS$3.87bUS$4.84bUS$5.94bUS$6.55bUS$7.00bUS$7.37bUS$7.70bUS$7.98bUS$8.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.88%Est @ 5.41%Est @ 4.38%Est @ 3.66%Est @ 3.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.9kUS$4.4kUS$4.5kUS$4.5kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$4.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$149bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$149b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$72bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$113b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$98.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Starbucks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.096. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Assuming the Federal Reserve can manage a soft landing, Wall Street analysts forecast that earnings per share in the S&amp;P 500 would be flat at $224 in 2023, and the index would drop by 2% to 3,900 over the next six months. However, a hard economic landing is entirely possible, with analysts expecting that earnings per share would decline 11% to $200 in that scenario, and the S&amp;P 500 would plummet 21% to 3150. In an economic backdrop consisting of slow growth, reduced inflation, and new monetary policies, Morgan Stanley predicts that 2023 will bring upside for bonds, defensive equities, and emerging markets. Andrew Sheets, Chief Cross-Asset Strategist for Morgan Stanley Research, said on November 22: “For markets, this presents a very different backdrop than 2022, which was marked by resilient growth, high inflation and hawkish policy. Overall, 2023 will be a good year for income investing.”People who are just starting out their investment journeys are often unsure where to put their money in such a volatile environment.

On November 2, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 7, to shareholders of record on November 16. Baird analyst Ben Kallo on October 26 raised the price target on Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) to $98 from $94 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he remains a buyer as underlying demand continues to be resilient while Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) navigates a mixed supply chain and exchange rate environment. He also said management continues to add value to shareholders through share repurchases and strategic M&amp;A, setting up a robust long-term outlook.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 37 hedge funds were bullish on Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.4 million shares worth $117.7 million. Like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the best stocks for a beginner investment portfolio. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”13. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), the British energy and petrochemical company, is one of the best beginner stocks to invest in. On November 28, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced that it has agreed to acquire Danish biogas producer Nature Energy Biogas from Davidson Kempner Capital Management for approximately $2 billion. After acquiring Europe's biggest producer of renewable natural gas, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) will expand its established customer base across several sectors and boost its transition to net-zero emissions.On November 11, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd raised the price target on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) to $71 from $65 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The Q3 results were incrementally bullish for the integrated oil 2023 macro outlook, the analyst wrote in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was part of 39 public stock portfolios at the end of September 2022, and Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 20.7 million shares worth $1 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a New York-based financial holding company that provides financial products and services to enterprises, governments, financial institutions, and individuals in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. On November 9, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ventured back into the global exchange traded fund marketplace with the launch of the Innovator Equity Managed Floor ETF (NYSE:SFLR). SFLR is a new fund that offers a 0.89% expense ratio, 256 portfolio holdings, and seeks to provide actively managed floors that attempt to limit losses to 10% each year.On October 17, Citi analyst Keith Horowitz maintained a Buy recommendation on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $97. The bank had a ""slight miss"" in Q3 2022 as the business model works best in upward trending markets, but posting a 15% ROTCE in tight market conditions ""speaks to the durability of the revenue stream,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 52 hedge funds were bullish on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 58 funds in the last quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 12.6 million shares worth $996.4 million. Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)11. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), the American coffee giant, is one of the best stocks for beginners to invest in.

Same Store sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the most stable and resilient dividend stocks to monitor, with a history of consistently increasing payouts for 60 years. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the top stocks for beginners to consider for a safe portfolio. On October 20, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also posted market-beating Q3 results. UBS analyst Peter Grom raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $68 from $63 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on October 26.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $22.40 billion. Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) sold off with consumer staples even as the company reported strong pricing for the second quarter. On average, product prices rose with management hinting at further momentum.”9. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based financial institution that operates through four segments – Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer &amp; Wealth Management. On October 18, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) reported a Q3 GAAP EPS of $8.25 and a revenue of $11.98 billion, topping analysts’ estimates by $0.57 and $450 million, respectively. On October 19, BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham maintained an Outperform rating on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $469 from $470 after its Q3 results. The company should be able to maintain a mid-teens RoTCE in the medium term on the back of ongoing tailwinds from share gains in core Global Banking and Markets, along with improved profitability from higher growth adjacencies of Transaction Banking and Consumer businesses, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 69 hedge funds held bullish positions in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), with combined stakes worth $4.5 billion. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is one of the largest stakeholders of the company, with 2.20 million shares valued at $647.3 million. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)8. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Next on our list of the best beginner stocks is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), an American general merchandise retailer. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an appropriate investment for beginners given its defensive nature, strong financials, and robust dividend. On November 28, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $578 from $581. The analyst told investors to stick with the ""winners"" in retail.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 69 hedge funds were bullish on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 64 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.10 million shares worth $521.7 million. Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”7.

(NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”6. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), an American holding company engaged in the insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses, is one of the best stocks that beginners should closely monitor.

(NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the top stocks favored by elite hedge funds. Here is what Black Bear Value Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Gas Stocks To Buy10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 14 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

It reduces procedure setup time and improves patient throughput by removing extensive preparation steps while simultaneously optimizing patient dosing.According to a statement released by General Electric, recent research shows that CT motion can enable six additional patient CT exams each day compared to a regular dual-syringe-based injector using single or multi-dose vials. The research also shows that the GE Healthcare branded injector reduces cost from consumables and saves 30ml of contrast per procedure, on average.General Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company price | General Electric Company QuoteThe statement released by GE reveals that the U.S. contrast media injector market is estimated to grow at 4.3% annually between 2022 and 2030. This should drive demand for the Healthcare unit’s latest offering.General Electric expects global demand for iodinated contrast media to double in the next 10 years, owing to the prevalence of chronic disorders and growth in CT procedures. To meet this anticipated surge in demand, the company recently invested $80 million at its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients site in Lindesnes, Norway, to increase contrast media manufacturing capacity by 30%.In order to meet the growing demand for iodinated contrast media, GE has also invested $30 million to open an additional manufacturing line at its facility in Cork, Ireland. The company has also entered into a multi-year agreement with Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile to increase the iodine supply.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now. As per Goldman Sachs, the stock market will experience relatively less pain next year compared to 2022 but there will be no gains, as enterprises post slow earnings growth through the rest of 2023. Assuming the Federal Reserve can manage a soft landing, Wall Street analysts forecast that earnings per share in the S&amp;P 500 would be flat at $224 in 2023, and the index would drop by 2% to 3,900 over the next six months. However, a hard economic landing is entirely possible, with analysts expecting that earnings per share would decline 11% to $200 in that scenario, and the S&amp;P 500 would plummet 21% to 3150. In an economic backdrop consisting of slow growth, reduced inflation, and new monetary policies, Morgan Stanley predicts that 2023 will bring upside for bonds, defensive equities, and emerging markets. Andrew Sheets, Chief Cross-Asset Strategist for Morgan Stanley Research, said on November 22: “For markets, this presents a very different backdrop than 2022, which was marked by resilient growth, high inflation and hawkish policy. Overall, 2023 will be a good year for income investing.”People who are just starting out their investment journeys are often unsure where to put their money in such a volatile environment. Some of the best beginner stocks to monitor include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Our Methodology The best stocks for beginner investors are usually safer stocks that pay dividends so that these investors aren't discouraged by large losses that are experienced more frequently by smaller-cap risky stocks that also offer potentially higher returns. Every investor's dream is to uncover safe stocks that can deliver large returns. At Insider Monkey we focus on the stocks that are favored by hedge funds and our monthly newsletter's stock picks managed to outperform the S&amp;P 500 Index funds by 74 percentage points over the last 5.5 years. Beginner investors can subscribe to our free daily newsletter to read about some of the stocks hedge funds are piling into.Story continuesFor this article we selected stocks which are defensive in nature, offer strong market visibility, can thrive in the rising rates environment, have resilient dividend profiles, and display a longstanding history of surviving turbulent market environments. We have also considered some stocks priced under $100 for beginner investors with limited money. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. 14 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashBest Beginner Stocks to Buy Now 14. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is an Illinois-based company that procures, transports, processes, and commercializes agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. On November 2, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 7, to shareholders of record on November 16. Baird analyst Ben Kallo on October 26 raised the price target on Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) to $98 from $94 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he remains a buyer as underlying demand continues to be resilient while Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) navigates a mixed supply chain and exchange rate environment. He also said management continues to add value to shareholders through share repurchases and strategic M&amp;A, setting up a robust long-term outlook.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 37 hedge funds were bullish on Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.4 million shares worth $117.7 million. Like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the best stocks for a beginner investment portfolio. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”13. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), the British energy and petrochemical company, is one of the best beginner stocks to invest in. On November 28, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced that it has agreed to acquire Danish biogas producer Nature Energy Biogas from Davidson Kempner Capital Management for approximately $2 billion. After acquiring Europe's biggest producer of renewable natural gas, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) will expand its established customer base across several sectors and boost its transition to net-zero emissions.On November 11, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd raised the price target on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) to $71 from $65 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The Q3 results were incrementally bullish for the integrated oil 2023 macro outlook, the analyst wrote in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was part of 39 public stock portfolios at the end of September 2022, and Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 20.7 million shares worth $1 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a New York-based financial holding company that provides financial products and services to enterprises, governments, financial institutions, and individuals in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. On November 9, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ventured back into the global exchange traded fund marketplace with the launch of the Innovator Equity Managed Floor ETF (NYSE:SFLR). SFLR is a new fund that offers a 0.89% expense ratio, 256 portfolio holdings, and seeks to provide actively managed floors that attempt to limit losses to 10% each year.On October 17, Citi analyst Keith Horowitz maintained a Buy recommendation on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $97. The bank had a ""slight miss"" in Q3 2022 as the business model works best in upward trending markets, but posting a 15% ROTCE in tight market conditions ""speaks to the durability of the revenue stream,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 52 hedge funds were bullish on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 58 funds in the last quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 12.6 million shares worth $996.4 million. Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)11. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), the American coffee giant, is one of the best stocks for beginners to invest in. On November 4, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported a FQ4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 and a revenue of $8.41 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $90 million, respectively. Comparable store sales climbed 7% globally, with sales increasing 11% in the U.S. and double digits internationally, excluding China.On November 4, Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer raised the price target on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) to $97 from $95 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares, telling investors that he is ""less worried"" about FY23 sales and earnings after the company's FQ4 results. He lifted his FY23 EPS estimate to $3.39 from $3.25, which now reflects U.S. same-store sales growth of 8.5%, up from 7.5%.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 54 funds reported owning stakes worth $2.26 billion in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 55 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.4 billion. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the leading stakeholders of the company, with approximately 3 million shares valued at $252.5 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Same Store sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the most stable and resilient dividend stocks to monitor, with a history of consistently increasing payouts for 60 years. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the top stocks for beginners to consider for a safe portfolio. On October 20, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also posted market-beating Q3 results. UBS analyst Peter Grom raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $68 from $63 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on October 26. The company's Q3 earnings beat was ""impressive"" as its organic growth sufficiently offset the currency headwinds, the analyst told investors. According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 59 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 60 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $22.40 billion. Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) sold off with consumer staples even as the company reported strong pricing for the second quarter. On average, product prices rose with management hinting at further momentum.”9. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based financial institution that operates through four segments – Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer &amp; Wealth Management. On October 18, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) reported a Q3 GAAP EPS of $8.25 and a revenue of $11.98 billion, topping analysts’ estimates by $0.57 and $450 million, respectively. On October 19, BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham maintained an Outperform rating on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $469 from $470 after its Q3 results. The company should be able to maintain a mid-teens RoTCE in the medium term on the back of ongoing tailwinds from share gains in core Global Banking and Markets, along with improved profitability from higher growth adjacencies of Transaction Banking and Consumer businesses, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 69 hedge funds held bullish positions in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), with combined stakes worth $4.5 billion. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is one of the largest stakeholders of the company, with 2.20 million shares valued at $647.3 million. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)8. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Next on our list of the best beginner stocks is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), an American general merchandise retailer. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an appropriate investment for beginners given its defensive nature, strong financials, and robust dividend. On November 28, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $578 from $581. The analyst told investors to stick with the ""winners"" in retail.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 69 hedge funds were bullish on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 64 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.10 million shares worth $521.7 million. Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”7. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $99 from $108. The analyst updated select estimates ahead of Q3 earnings season from the Power and Utilities group to reflect ""known and measurable year-over-year items,"" to adjust for seasonality, and to re-mark to the latest commodity curves. According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 73 hedge funds were long NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), up from 59 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2 million shares worth $157 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”6. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), an American holding company engaged in the insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses, is one of the best stocks that beginners should closely monitor.

(NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the top stocks favored by elite hedge funds. Here is what Black Bear Value Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Gas Stocks To Buy10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 14 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Successive acquisitions are driving the company’s top line. Strong cash flow generation capacity is supporting the company’s shareholder-friendly activities.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that might make investing in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a smart choice now.Business Strength: Roper’s Application Software segment is benefiting from strength across its Deltek, Vertafore, Aderant, CliniSys and Data Innovations businesses. The segment’s growth is supported by strength in its recurring revenue stream, led by strong customer retention and continued migration to SaaS delivery models. The company expects organic growth of 6-8% for the segment in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Network Software segment is benefiting from strong performance of the U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses. Strength across the Foundry business owing to solid innovation capability is driving the segment’s performance. Solid customer additions are aiding the iTradeNetwork business within the Network Software segment.For the fourth quarter, the company expects organic growth of 8-10%. With record orders and backlog levels, Roper’s Neptune business is fueling growth of the Technology Enabled Products segment. Strong ordering activity in the medical product business, including Verathon and Northern Digital, is a key growth driver for the segment. For the fourth quarter, the company expects organic growth of 5-7% for the segment.Roper Technologies, Inc. Price and ConsensusRoper Technologies, Inc. Price and ConsensusRoper Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Roper Technologies, Inc. QuoteInorganic Growth Initiatives: Roper is carrying out successive acquisitions to expand its operations. In October 2022, the company acquired Frontline Education for $3.7 billion. The acquisition builds on Roper’s Horizon software business (which it acquired in 2008), expanding its presence in the K-12 education market. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $370 million to Roper’s revenues and $175 million to its EBITDA in 2023. In January 2022, the company acquired American LegalNet, which strengthened its Aderant business to provide comprehensive software solutions to its customers in the legal industry.Story continuesPortfolio Restructuring: Roper has been divesting non-profitable/non-core assets or businesses to focus on its core areas of growth. In June 2022, the company entered into a deal with CD&amp;R to sell its Process Technologies segment and industrial units of the Measurement &amp; Analytical Solutions segment. The company expects after-tax proceeds from the transaction to enhance its capital-deployment ability by over 7 billion to acquire lucrative businesses. Subject to customary conditions, the transaction is expected to be completed by 2022-end. In March, the company sold its TransCore business. In fourth-quarter 2021, it completed the divestitures of Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses.Improved Outlook: Following a strong third-quarter performance and to include the effect of Frontline acquisition, Roper raised its full-year outlook. For 2022, the company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $14.09-$14.13 (previous view: $13.46-$13.62). Organic growth from continuing operations is expected to be 9% in 2022. For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates earnings per share of $3.72-$3.76. The company’s focus on investing in long term, sustainable organic growth along with product innovations should drive its growth going forward.Shareholder-Friendly Activities: Strong cash flow generation capacity supports Roper’s shareholder-friendly activities. In the third quarter, the company generated an adjusted free cash flow of $353 million, up 9.3% year over year. In the first nine months of 2022, ROP rewarded its shareholders with a dividend payment of $196.2 million, up 10.9% year over year. In November 2022, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.Northbound Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Roper’s 2022 earnings estimate has been revised upward by 3.9% in the past 60 days.

SPG, Kimco Realty Corp. KIM and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. SKT.Industry: Retail REITLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2022723/3-top-reits-to-buy-from-the-rebound-in-retail-reit-industryThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry constituents are poised to benefit from the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime. Efforts to support omni-channel retailing, adaptive reuse capabilities and opportunities emanating from consolidations, and focus on e-commerce resistant sectors have poised Simon Property Group, Inc., Kimco Realty Corp. and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. well for growth.However, inflationary pressure and economic slowdown might cast a pall on recovery. Rising borrowing costs and labor market pessimism are likely to weigh down on consumers' willingness to spend to some extent. Also, higher e-commerce adoption might continue to affect retail landlords' cash flows.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry embodies a group of REITs engaged in owning, developing, managing and renting space in a variety of retail real estates. Among these are regional malls, outlet centers, grocery-anchored shopping centers and power centers, including big-box retailers. Also, net lease REITs enjoy the ownership of freestanding properties, wherein both rent and the majority of operating expenses for the properties are borne by the tenants.The overall health of the economy, job market and consumer spending are the main drivers of retail REITs while property locations and trade area demographics play key roles in demand determination. Although dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering this asset category in the past, it is on its recovery on shoppers' renewed enthusiasm for an in-person shopping experience.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry?Renewed Enthusiasm for In-Store Shopping Experience to Fuel Recovery: This industry is poised to benefit from the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers as they look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime. As such, the landlords remain upbeat about the ongoing holiday shopping season. Also, the optimistic view of retailers for long-term growth is likely to act as a tailwind.Amid this, retailers' focus has now shifted from the closing of stores to the revival of their growth plans, resulting in more demand for physical store spaces and paving the way for the retail REITs to experience gains in leasing activity, pricing power and flourish. Moreover, retailers are focusing on investments in their stores because apart from serving as showrooms, physical stores offer a convenient location for pick-up or exchange of goods, helping retailers counter the increasing costs associated with last-mile delivery.Limited New Supply and Rapid Formation of New Businesses to Drive Leasing: Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, the construction of new retail space remains dreary. Moreover, lease signings, rent and occupancies in retail real estates are likely to get a boost from limited new supply, the waning of pandemic concerns and the rapid formation of new businesses in the retail sector.Omni-Channel Strategy, Structural Changes in Focus: Omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This is quite evident from the recent foot traffic at retail destinations.Digitally-native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy since the opening of stores helps them to improve their connection with customers and drive expansion. In fact, for retailers, the focus now is not only on increasing their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations. Also, with the waning impact of the pandemic, entertainment and dining concepts are seeing a revival, boosting retail REITs' growth opportunities.Repurposing and Conversions Pick Up Pace: Retail REITs are now focusing on adaptive reuse, which includes multifamily, hotel, office and medical components, resulting in the construction of mixed-use real estate destinations. In fact, the mixed-use development option has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps to catch the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.Moreover, the open-air format and pick-up concepts have been helping landlords to lure tenants. Also, the conversion of malls into distribution hubs has accelerated as these distribution centers, being situated close to consumers of retailers, facilitate faster delivery of products and aid retailers in improving services, lower costs and make optimum asset utilization.Inflationary Pressure, Economic Slowdown Cast a Pall on Recovery: Higher material and operating costs remain a concern for the retailers and this, in turn, might cast a pall on their landlords' cash flows. Moreover, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings, rising borrowing costs and labor market pessimism is likely to weigh down on consumers' willingness to spend to some extent.Higher E-commerce Adoption to Remain a Concern: Consumers' habits have transformed at a rapid pace over the past years and traffic at retail real estates has suffered, with e-commerce capturing market share from brick-and-mortar stores. With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. Yet, given the convenience it offers, online shopping is likely to remain a popular choice among customers. This might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's growth potential. Since April, the industry's FFO per share estimate for 2022 has moved 1.1% north.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Performance Mix With Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector over the past year but outperformed the S&amp;P 500 composite.The industry has declined 13.2% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 15.1% and the broader Finance sector's decline of 9.2%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Retail REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 14.57X compared with the S&amp;P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 17.89X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector's forward 12-month P/E of 13.90X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.49X, as low as 10.20X, with a median of 15.39X.3 Retail REIT Stocks to ConsiderSimon Property Group: This retail REIT is a behemoth in its industry and enjoys a portfolio of premium retail assets in the United States and abroad. The adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers have been aiding the company. It is also tapping growth opportunities by assisting digital brands to enhance their brick-and-mortar presence, as well as capitalizing on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy.Additionally, Simon Property is exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years among those who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.Moreover, with solid balance-sheet strength and available capital resources, Simon Property Group looks poised to ride this growth curve and bank on opportunities emanating from market dislocations.Its third-quarter results reflected healthy operating performance, solid leasing activity and a rise in occupancy levels. Simon Property also announced a 2.9% sequential hike and a 9.1% year-over-year increase in its fourth-quarter 2022 dividend.Simon Property Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share witnessed marginal upward revision to $11.68, reflecting analysts' bullish outlook. The stock has appreciated 34.5% so far in the quarter. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kimco Realty Corporation: Jericho, NY-based Kimco Realty is a leading publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets in the United States.Kimco is well-poised to benefit from its properties, which are predominantly grocery-anchored, and in the drivable first-ring suburbs of its top major metropolitan Sunbelt and coastal markets, having several growth levers. Its focus on last-mile assets, capital-recycling efforts and a strong balance-sheet position act as tailwinds.Currently, Kimco carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year's FFO per share has been revised marginally upward to $1.58 over the past month, indicating a year-on-year improvement of 14.5%. The stock has appreciated 23.4% so far in the quarter.Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.: This Greensboro, NC-based retail REIT is a well-known operator of upscale, open-air outlet centers. SKT owns or has an ownership interest in, and manages a portfolio of 37 centers, with an additional center presently under development.With more than 41 years of experience in the outlet industry and a well-located portfolio, Tanger is poised to benefit from the upbeat retail environment in this holiday shopping season.Its strategic efforts, leasing acceleration operation revamp are aiding in NOI growth, rent spreads, longer lease terms and higher occupancy. With its open-air shopping destinations grabbing digitally native brands, iconic food and beverage, and entertainment uses, SKT is poised for growth in the upcoming period.Currently, SKT carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term growth rate of 8.90%, which is ahead of the industry average of 6.2%. Moreover, for 2022, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share being revised 1.7% upward to $1.8 over the past month. This also suggests an increase of 2.3% year over year. This upward trend in estimate revisions is also visible for 2023. The stock has also gained 42.7% quarter to date.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations.

(NYSE:HCA) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At HCA HealthcareThe Founder &amp; Chairman Emeritus Thomas Frist made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$215 each. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$236 per share to be enticing. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the HCA Healthcare insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 91.70k shares for US$19m. But insiders sold 59.56k shares worth US$14m. Overall, HCA Healthcare insiders were net buyers during the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).HCA Healthcare Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at HCA Healthcare. In total, insiders dumped US$5.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of HCA HealthcareI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. HCA Healthcare insiders own 1.3% of the company, currently worth about US$871m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The HCA Healthcare Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought HCA Healthcare stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. But we take heart from prior transactions. And insider ownership remains quite considerable. So we're happy to look past recent trading. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

For the latest on those, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova. Alexandra.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, guys, it's that time of year again, when Wall Street's big banks are looking at their magic eight balls to tell investors what they expect for the year ahead. And if you're an equity investor, there is not much to look forward to. The S&amp;P 500 will trade just 1% higher than yesterday's close. That's according to the price target of strategists at both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.And the culprit for that is weak corporate earnings growth. That has been a theme for the new year on Wall Street. On Goldman's side, strategists led by David Kostin said that there will be less pain but not gain for US stocks. They estimate earnings per share on S&amp;P 500 companies to be unchanged at roughly $224, attributing this lack of growth to sustained higher rates. And this is, of course, based on their base case scenario that the economy will not enter recession. If it does, that, of course, could be much worse.And then on Bank of America's side, they see earnings per share falling 9% to $200. They attributed this to two things. The first is the erosion of margins across companies. Their near-term bearishness is based on wage growth outpacing the ability of companies to raise prices, which will really weigh on their earnings. According to their research, only half of the S&amp;P 500 companies are posting real sales growth.And the second is really quite interesting. They call this the wealth effect on steroids. So basically, the wealth effect is a behavioral economic phenomenon that suggests that consumers spend more as they see the value of their assets rise.And in this case, they think because of the democratization of finance that we saw, because so many more people were making Robinhood accounts, participating in SPAC deals and other areas of the market, more people will be participating in the erosion of $22 trillion in wealth that we have seen last year. That is going to weigh on consumer spending power in the new year.Story continuesThey are still bullish in the long-term. They see the S&amp;P 500 returning 8% annually over the next 10 years. They put out a really interesting stat. They said if you own the S&amp;P 500 Index for a day, the chances of making money are just more than a coin flip, about 54%. But if you own it for 10 years, there's a 94% chance of making money. So it pays off to be a long-term investor.BRAD SMITH: Wow, all right, two-sided coin there-- well, at least in the near term. We'll see what the perspective is for the long-term. That's their outlook actually for stocks. So what about for the economic picture as well?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, so they see the economy, two very different pictures there. Bank of America sees the US heading into mild recession in the first half of the year. They see unemployment rising to 5.5%. Their target for the federal funds rate is 5% to 5.25%. But they did say that it could reach as high as 6% because of the continued momentum that we have seen in the economy and in the labor market. They don't see the Fed cutting rates until December.And then Goldman Sachs sees the unemployment rate at 4.2%, just half a percentage point higher than it is right now. The federal funds rate also at 5% to 5.25%. And they don't expect a rate cut next year because they don't think that the US economy will head into a recession, and they don't think that a slowdown in inflation will be enough for the Fed to cut rates.BRAD SMITH: Thanks for tracking this all. Alexandra Semenova, Yahoo Finance's own, breaking this down for us. Appreciate it.]"

(NYSE:GS) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 15x and even P/E's higher than 29x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.Goldman Sachs Group hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Goldman Sachs Group will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?Goldman Sachs Group's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 38% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 67% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 0.07% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 9.0% per annum, which paints a poor picture.In light of this, it's understandable that Goldman Sachs Group's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Goldman Sachs Group's P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Goldman Sachs Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Goldman Sachs Group.

If you want to see more such rating downgrades, go directly to Analysts are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Stock markets are under pressure ahead of Jerome Powell’s speech on Wednesday and Beijing’s renewed mobility restrictions. Meanwhile, protests broke out across several big cities in China against the government’s zero-Covid strategy. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also in the red following reports which suggested the company would likely miss the production target for iPhone 14 Pro by 6 million. The shortfall is attributed to production delays at its biggest iPhone manufacturing facility in China.Meanwhile, First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) and Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) are also down after receiving downgrades from analysts.Moreover, analysts also recently lowered their ratings for Chinese EV maker XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) and sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG). Check out the remaining article to see the details of these downgrades.Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash10. Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Shares of Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) slid over three percent yesterday after Barclays cut its ratings for the  plant-based meat company from “Equal-Weight” to “Underweight.”Analyst Benjamin Theurer pointed towards a difficult outlook for protein-focused companies, including Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND). He reduced his price target for BYND stock from $13 per share to $10 per share.Theurer believes price-conscious customers are switching to cheaper protein options and avoiding expensive alternative meat products from companies like Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND). He also predicted a tougher operating environment for the industry over the next few years.9. Lufax Holding Ltd (NYSE:LU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Shares of Lufax Holding Ltd (NYSE:LU) plunged to a new low on Friday, November 25, after Credit Suisse downgraded the Chinese personal financial services platform from “Neutral” to “Underperform.”Story continuesAnalyst Frank Zheng was primarily moved by the company’s lower-than-expected results for Q3 and a weak outlook for the full year. Zheng also trimmed his price target for Lufax Holding Ltd (NYSE:LU) from $1.70 per share to $1.40 per share.Lufax Holding Ltd (NYSE:LU) recently reported earnings of 16 cents per share for Q3, marginally below the consensus of 17 cents. Total net income of $1.86 billion also fell short of $1.99 billion estimated by analysts.For the full year, Lufax Holding Ltd (NYSE:LU) expects its net profit to drop in the range of 47 - 48 percent on a year-over-year basis.8. XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) came into the spotlight recently after Jefferies turned bearish on the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker. The research firm downgraded XPeng stock from “Hold” to “Sell,” citing intense competition and increasing lithium prices.Lithium is one of the key elements used in EV batteries. Its prices are currently up nearly 200 percent when compared to the same period of 2021. Jefferies analyst Johnson Wan thinks increasing lithium prices and removal of subsidies for EV manufacturers in China would likely hurt the margins of XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV).Wan also pointed towards the higher prices of XPeng cars. Moreover, he reduced his price target for XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) from $18.60 per share to $4.20 per share.7. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Shares of DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) dropped nearly four percent in pre-market trading Monday after JPMorgan cut its ratings for the sports betting company from “Neural” to “Sell.”JPMorgan analyst Joseph Greff expects DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) shares to move down after their post-earnings rally earlier this month. Greff pointed towards the company’s adjusted EBITDA loss outlook of $575 - $475 million for 2023, which is wider than his estimate of around $350 million. Greff also believes DraftKings will take longer than its competitors to achieve profitability.Like DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), analysts also cut their ratings for First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) and Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV).6. Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Argus downgraded Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) from “Buy” to “Hold” on Friday, November 25, citing supply chain hurdles.Analyst John Eade thinks supply-chain challenges will impact the company’s margins and revenue in the coming quarters. Nevertheless, Eade expressed optimism about the long-term growth prospects of Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC).Separately, investment management Artisan Partners also discussed Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We pared our exposures to Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), Azenta and Burlington Stores in Q3. Generac is a provider of residential backup generators in the US with a dominant market position. Our thesis is based on climate change causing more frequent and severe storms and power grid failures, both of which should bolster demand for Generac’s generators. In addition, the company’s residential solar backup battery business—which benefits from Generac’s scale, distribution network and differentiated go-to-market strategy—could also enhance its overall profit cycle potential over time. That said, we believe generator demand may be entering a cyclical downturn as homeowners face inflation and rising interest rates. While our longer term thesis remains intact, we believe a smaller position is warranted.” Click to continue reading and see Analysts are Downgrading These 5 Stocks. Suggested articles:Ken Griffin Stock Portfolio15 Biggest Fintech Companies in the World12 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure: None.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Aptiv Is Aptiv Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.19bUS$1.76bUS$2.28bUS$3.01bUS$3.56bUS$4.03bUS$4.44bUS$4.77bUS$5.05bUS$5.29bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 18.3%Est @ 13.4%Est @ 9.97%Est @ 7.58%Est @ 5.9%Est @ 4.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$1.1kUS$1.4kUS$1.7kUS$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (10%– 2.0%) = US$64bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$64b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$43b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$102, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Aptiv as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.388. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Aptiv, there are three further items you should consider:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Aptiv   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does APTV's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

This year, in September, Spade took over from interim CEO Matt Blank. (Blank had, in turn, temporarily replaced Josh Sapan, who held the position for 26 years before becoming executive vice chairman at the company.) Spade was tasked with helping shift the company’s priorities from its cable business to streaming.Like Disney, AMC Networks wants to make more money from streamingAMC Networks has been amping up focus on its AMC+ streaming platform, as well as its niche streaming services like Shudder (horror), Acorn TV (British and international shows), Sundance Now (prestige drama, international thrillers, true crime, and more), ALLBLK (“inclusively, but unapologetically” black), and HIDIVE (anime).“This kind of focused approach might give the business model an edge over the existing players, as the company has very trendy and attractive content which might bring considerable subscribers to the AMC streaming platform,” the Enthusiastic Investors Club wrote for Seeking Alpha.But these efforts are yet to bear fruit. Streaming subscription numbers are exhibiting double-digit growth, but revenues are falling. As AMC faces industry-related pressures and economic headwinds, the C-suite ousting is only the start. Trims to its overall workforce are in the offing.AMC Networks is not the movie chain, it’s a cable TV companyAMC Networks is unrelated to the movie theater chain—and meme-stock darling—AMC Entertainment. It is a cable TV company that’s home to channels like AMC, BBC America (a joint venture with BBC Studios), and more. The maker of popular series like “Mad Men,” “Breaking Bad,” and “The Walking Dead,” AMC Networks has a $3 billion market cap—way smaller than the $30 billion market cap of AMC Entertainment.Story continuesAs legacy cable channels are dying out for myriad reasons—high costs, competition from streaming, consumers consuming content on the go—AMC Networks has struggled to adjust.The company has tried to join forces with bigger firms to help its business. In June, AMC signed a distribution agreement allowing Amazon Prime Video to show AMC series to subscribers across 28 countries and territories.

This is primarily due to “cord cutting.” At the same time we have seen the rise of direct to consumer streaming apps including our own AMC+. It was our belief that cord cutting losses would be offset by gains in streaming. This has not been the case. We are primarily a content company and the mechanisms for the monetization of content are in disarray.“It is for that reason that myself and the Board of Directors of AMC Networks have concluded that we as a company need to conserve our resources at this time. We have directed the executive leadership of AMC Networks to undergo significant cutbacks in operations. These will include a large-scale layoff as well as cuts to every operating area of AMC Networks.”- Excerpt from a memo that James Dolan, CEO of AMC’s parent company MSG Entertainment, sent to the staff, as obtained by IndieWireAMC Networks is not the only one feeling the streaming pressureAfter the pandemic-fuelled boom subsided, the entertainment industry has not been able to sustain the same monumental growth. Companies have had to shuffle management, reduce headcounts, and temper the expectations of shareholders.Warner Bros and DiscoverySince the Warner Bros-Discovery merger was completed in April, costcutting has been a top agenda item—and employees are bearing the brunt. There have been several layoffs across various departments including Warner Bros television, the HBO and HBO Max teams, ad sales operations staff, and IT personnel.Separately, content is also on the chopping table. By the summer of 2023, Warner Bros’ HBO Max and Discovery+ will merge into a single streaming service, likely to cut back on original programming and the expenses that come with it. Since the April merger, the company has reportedly cut back on $825 million worth of content, including shelving the $90 million Batgirl after it was shot.DisneyAfter Disney brought back former CEO Bob Iger to pull its loss-making Disney+ streaming service out of the doldrums, he doubled down on the hiring freeze at the company. Layoffs are reportedly on the table, too.NetflixNetflix laid off 150 staffers in May, and another 300 in June. In the first two quarters of the year, it was bleeding subscribers because of stiff competition and password sharing. It rebounded in the second half of the year, and started an ad-supported tier of subscriptions to boost revenues. It also has plans to turn one weakness into a strength: Starting in early 2023, Netflix will start charging for password sharing.CriterionIn October, Criterion—an industry leader in manufacturing laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-ray editions of prestige movies, which launched a streaming service in 2019—dismissed 16 of its 80 employees.Nexstar and the CWIn November, a month after Nexstar closed its acquisition of the CW, it laid off between 30 and 40 people. The CW’s CEO, Mark Pedowitz, who had been leading the channel since 2011, was among the first to leave on the day of the acquisition.Related stories👁️ The one thing keeping streaming TV from completely taking over🔔 How did Netflix lose subscribers in 2022?↩️ In a plot twist, Disney is bringing back CEO Bob Iger🪢 Is it time for television to get rebundled?More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

""Stranger Things 4"" has been dominant, but a show that I actually hadn't heard of-- and it's called ""Wednesday,"" right?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.DAVE BRIGGS: A significant accomplishment. What did it do, and what's the show about?ALEXANDRA CANAL: And I thought Wednesday would do well. This is a remake of ""The Addams Family,"" starring Jenna Ortega. She is an up and coming rising star. And people that I've spoken with-- I haven't gotten the chance to watch this yet, but people have that I've talked to have really enjoyed it. Tim Burton is directing it. So you got some star power there. And it now holds the record for the most hours viewed for an English-speaking show, securing 341.2 million hours viewed in its first week, compared to ""Stranger Things,"" 335 million. That was the previous record holder, so a huge beat there.Of course, it still lags ""Squid Game"" that has the all-time record. I think it's going to be very hard for any original show to beat that. Squid Game hit 571.8 million hours viewed in its peak week. But overall, I think ""Wednesday"" is a big nod to nostalgia. And it's a good thing for Netflix because a lot of the analysts on Wall Street have been debating whether or not Netflix was able to create another ""Stranger Thing"" success story. Could their content match up with some of the other competitors out there? But their original programming has been doing really well.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, they need one more from Shonda Rhimes maybe to--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Mm-hmm, yes. Ryan Murphy held up his end of the bargain. So now maybe Shonda.DAVE BRIGGS: Ryan Murphy is doing OK. All right, Allie Canal, thank you so much. Appreciate that.]"
107,56011def-abb3-326e-8b9a-b93381dc412b,NFLX,2022-11-30,Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Shareholders Will Want The ROCE Trajectory To Continue,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-nasdaq-nflx-shareholders-want-140057009.html,1669730457,STORY,['NFLX'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Netflix:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$48b - US$7.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Netflix has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.7% generated by the Entertainment industry. View our latest analysis for Netflix roceIn the above chart we have measured Netflix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Netflix.So How Is Netflix's ROCE Trending?Netflix is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 14%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 241%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.In another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 16%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. So this improvement in ROCE has come from the business' underlying economics, which is great to see.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, it's great to see that Netflix can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a solid 53% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

108,b54d72af-b4d8-38b8-bf30-e45be438247d,NFLX,2022-11-30,Bob Iger quotes Hamilton to boost Disney staff morale as he paves the way for job cuts and Disney+ price hikes,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bob-iger-quotes-hamilton-boost-132209819.html,1669728129,STORY,"['DIS', 'NFLX']","[A lot has changed at [hotlink]Disney[/hotlink] during the two years since returning CEO Bob Iger stepped down—but he reassured staff at the company on Monday that “our Disney world is still spinning.”Speaking at a town hall event for Disney employees, Iger said the company would shift gears when it came to its streaming business—which includes Disney+, ESPN+, and [hotlink]Hulu[/hotlink]—and make profitability the top priority.“Instead of chasing subscriptions with aggressive marketing and aggressive spending on content, we have to start chasing profitability,” he said, in comments reported by Reuters. “In order to achieve that we have to take a very, very hard look at our cost structure across our businesses.”Iger’s return to the helm of the entertainment giant, which saw former CEO Bob Chapek ousted, came days after Disney revealed a $1.5 billion loss in its streaming division for its fourth quarter—more than double the loss recorded a year earlier.On the back of the disappointing fiscal results earlier this month, Chapek announced cost-cutting measures that included plans for job cuts and a hiring freeze.Asked about the hiring freeze, Iger said it “felt like it was a wise thing to do.”“At the moment, I don’t have any plans to change it,” he said.Under Chapek, Disney invested billions into its streaming platforms, drastically increasing spending on original content as part of its growth strategy. That strategy helped the company build up a subscriber base to rival Netflix, but Disney warned when it published its fourth-quarter earnings that streaming growth could soon begin to fade, and streaming losses have been on shareholders’ radar over the past year.The company will launch a cheaper, ad-supported Disney+ subscription in the U.S. in December in a bid to boost subscriber numbers and revenue through advertising—which it hopes will help put the company’s streaming business on the path to profitability.Analyst Brendan Brady told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that the “three ways to chase profitability here are to cut costs, raise prices, and add subscribers.”Story continuesEarlier this year, former CEO Chapek said that even considering Disney’s plans to hike subscription prices on its flagship streaming platform, Disney+ was “way underpriced.” The service is typically cheaper than what it costs for a subscription at rival platforms like [hotlink]HBO[/hotlink] Max and [hotlink]Netflix[/hotlink].In a nod to the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, Iger told Disney staffers on Monday: “The status quo is gone, a lot has changed, but the sun is still shining and our world, our Disney world, is still spinning”—a paraphrase of lyrics from the song “What’d I Miss?”Disney shares closed around 3% lower on Monday but edged slightly higher in premarket trade on Tuesday morning.

If you want to read about some more consumer stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider.Consumer stocks are generally considered one of the safest investments at the stock market because of their predictable business models and relatively lower price volatility as compared to other sectors of the economy. Some examples of consumer industries include food and beverage producers, household item manufacturers, personal care product manufacturers, and tobacco companies. The consumer industry is also highly consolidated in nature, a key driver of demand for the sector in a volatile macro environment. Some of the top firms in this space are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). In the past few months, even as inflation impacts the short-term spending trends, there is a belief among experts that this sentiment might weigh on manufacturing stocks longer than expected. However, the long-term growth indicators for the industry remain overwhelmingly positive, making the sector a top retirement stock portfolio pick.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the consumer sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Consumer Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider11. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35  Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) operates as a food company worldwide. It is one of the best safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. It operates through four segments: Beef, Pork, Chicken, and Prepared Foods. On October 5, Tyson Foods noted that it is bringing all corporate teams to its headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. On November 3, Tyson Foods announced a partnership agreement with Tanmiah Food Co., producer and supplier of poultry and other meat products, to invest in the poultry capacity of Supreme Foods Processing Co. Story continuesThe firm has paid a dividend to shareholders for more than three decades. In the past ten years, this payout has registered consistent growth. On October 27, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery maintained a Neutral rating on Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stock and lowered the price target to $68 from $79, noting that the consumer demand in an inflationary environment remains at risk and falling prices will affect the firm’s chicken and beef segments.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 35 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.1 billion in Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), compared to 37 in the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion. Just like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is one of the safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. 10. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52  Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates as a general merchandise retailer in the United States. It is one of the top safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 26, Target Corporation revealed an expanded collaboration with Apple which includes a threefold increase in Apple at Target locations. The company said that it is offering the members of its loyalty program access to a four-month free trial of Apple Fitness+ with no purchase required. Target Corp has a dividend history stretching back more than fifty years. On August 18, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli maintained a Hold rating on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock and raised the price target to $165 from $150, noting that the company’s second quarter sales were in-line, but its earnings were still below the twice-revised forecast amid heavily marked down inventory clearing activity.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 52 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2 billion in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $1.3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat-footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters (…read more)9. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55      The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) operates as an off-price apparel and home fashion retailer.

The firm is slowly trying to build a dividend profile.On October 25, Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger maintained an Overweight rating on The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) stock and raised the price target to $80 from $77, noting that the off-price retailers’ operating margins are below pre-Covid levels because of the volatile retail operating environment. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm BlueSpruce Investments is a leading shareholder in The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) with 5.4 million shares worth more than $332.3 million.  In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the U.S. and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes.”8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide.

Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Lowe’s Companies, Inc.

Copper price saw its peak in April at about $10,000 per tonne and has since lost a third of its price.

Additionally, the macroeconomic pressures forced a mass sell-off on London Metal Exchange.Copper Demand and SupplyThe annual copper demand is expected to increase by 53% by 2040, mainly due to the electrification of vehicles. Global EV sales are expected to account for 40% of the total car sales by 2030. However, the world is looking at copper shortages in the near future.The copper inventories are near historical lows. On top of that, copper giants are expected to face production shortages in the future. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) recently halted its $2 billion copper and gold project in Peru.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this gold and copper miner have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, which Newmont falls in, has gained 14.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share, indicating a change of -37.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.8%. This estimate has changed -9.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.33 indicates a change of +22.9% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Newmont is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Newmont, the consensus sales estimate of $2.92 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.8%. The $11.81 billion and $12.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.4% and +2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.59%. The EPS surprise was -6.9%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Markets are also awaiting key U.S. payrolls data later in the week.While the minutes of the Fed’s November meeting showed that a growing number of Fed members support smaller rate hikes in the coming months, Fed speakers have warned that stubborn inflation will likely keep U.S. rates elevated until well into 2024.This did little to curb a month-long rally in metal markets, as the prospect of a smaller rate hike in December offered much relief to non-yielding assets such as gold.Spot gold prices steadied around $1,748.99 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,747.30 an ounce. Both instruments jumped nearly 1% on Tuesday, and were set to rise around 7% for November- their strongest monthly gain since May 2021.But the outlook for gold still remains muted, given that U.S. inflation is trending well above the Fed’s annual target. Stubborn inflation could see the central bank tighten monetary policy further to bring down prices- a scenario that is negative for gold.The yellow metal fell sharply this year as rising interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell slightly on Wednesday, but were also set for their best month in 2022.Copper futures fell 0.1% to $3.6405 a pound, after rising 0.7% in the prior session. But they were set to rise nearly 8% in November- their best month since early-2021.Copper prices were largely boosted by speculation over the scaling back of COVID-related restrictions in major importer China.Story continuesThe world’s largest copper importer is facing increased public ire over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has driven speculation that the government will be forced to suspend restrictive measures.But Beijing has given no such indication so far, as the country grapples with a record-high daily increase in COVID-19 infections. This saw the reintroduction of strict movement curbs in several major cities over the past two months, which weighed heavily on China's economy.Related ArticlesGold, copper set for best month in 2022 on dovish Fed, China hopesU.S. senators introduce bill to expand E15 gasoline sales, with support from oil groupOil extends rebound on hopes of China reopening, OPEC cut speculation]"

Parent General Dynamics has seen its aerospace unit backlog swell to $19.1 billion during the third quarter.Gulfstream said it did not anticipate any restrictions on the use of the APU, which generates energy for functions like starting power for the main engines.Gulfstream said it has ""notified the FAA and are working collaboratively with them on this issue.""(Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal.

This performance momentum has been underpinned by a history of outperformance, with the recent strong Q3 report the 10th straight quarter of better-than-expected top and bottom line results. Sales improved year over year driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.However, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins.

Assuming the Federal Reserve can manage a soft landing, Wall Street analysts forecast that earnings per share in the S&amp;P 500 would be flat at $224 in 2023, and the index would drop by 2% to 3,900 over the next six months. However, a hard economic landing is entirely possible, with analysts expecting that earnings per share would decline 11% to $200 in that scenario, and the S&amp;P 500 would plummet 21% to 3150. In an economic backdrop consisting of slow growth, reduced inflation, and new monetary policies, Morgan Stanley predicts that 2023 will bring upside for bonds, defensive equities, and emerging markets. Andrew Sheets, Chief Cross-Asset Strategist for Morgan Stanley Research, said on November 22: “For markets, this presents a very different backdrop than 2022, which was marked by resilient growth, high inflation and hawkish policy. Overall, 2023 will be a good year for income investing.”People who are just starting out their investment journeys are often unsure where to put their money in such a volatile environment. Some of the best beginner stocks to monitor include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc.

Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), the British energy and petrochemical company, is one of the best beginner stocks to invest in. On November 28, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced that it has agreed to acquire Danish biogas producer Nature Energy Biogas from Davidson Kempner Capital Management for approximately $2 billion.

We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a New York-based financial holding company that provides financial products and services to enterprises, governments, financial institutions, and individuals in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

The bank had a ""slight miss"" in Q3 2022 as the business model works best in upward trending markets, but posting a 15% ROTCE in tight market conditions ""speaks to the durability of the revenue stream,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 52 hedge funds were bullish on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 58 funds in the last quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 12.6 million shares worth $996.4 million. Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)11.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)8. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Next on our list of the best beginner stocks is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), an American general merchandise retailer.

Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”7.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Gas Stocks To Buy10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 14 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To skip our detailed analysis on climate change stocks and more, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Climate Change Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.If there's one global crisis everyone is likely to have heard of by now, it's climate change. The problem posed by this phenomenon is extremely complex, and its resolution requires significant changes in the way we go about our daily lives. With rising emissions of greenhouse gases trapping heat in the atmosphere, global temperatures have been on the climb, contributing to a range of geological problems. As a result, many economic and market implications have also begun to be contemplated. According to a report published by the CFA Institute in 2020, economic losses caused by climate change could be between $4 trillion and $20 trillion.As a result, climate change stocks, or stocks promoting the use of clean energy, have become the newest popular commodity on the market. Stocks like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN) are a few of the more renowned names on this list of stocks. These are also the stocks set to benefit immensely from the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act which aims to combat the climate crisis. The Act laid down that it aimed to build 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery plants by 2030 to promote the use of clean energy. Embarking on such large-scale projects over the coming few years is expected to greatly increase the business and revenues of major clean energy companies on the rise.Another report published by the International Energy Agency in March 2021 went over the total returns from global markets portfolios over the preceding 10 years and five years, showing a comparison between returns from portfolios containing fossil fuel companies and renewable power companies. The total return for the former over the past 10 years came in at 59%, while for the latter, it came in at 422.7%. Over the preceding five years, the returns came in at 59.3% and 186.6%, respectively. This shows the relative profitability of climate change stocks in comparison to traditional energy stocks, especially in light of growing concerns relating to the climate crisis.Story continues12 Best Climate Change Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 12 best climate change stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Our MethodologyWe scanned the database of 920 hedge fund holdings maintained by Insider Monkey and picked the top 12 stocks (in terms of hedge fund popularity) that are engaged in the clean energy sector in various forms.

Much of Tesla's share loss is to EVs available in a more accessible MSRP range – below $50,000, where Tesla does not yet truly compete.New EV entries nibbling away at Tesla EV share, according to S&amp;P Global MobilityRegardless of brand or price point, early S&amp;P Global Mobility data suggests consumers moving to electric vehicles in 2022 are largely doing so from Toyota and Honda – brands which have been unable to keep their internal combustion owners loyal until their own brands begin to participate more significantly in the EV transition.While both Japanese companies built a US legacy with phenomenal fuel economy and powertrain technologies – including electrification through hybrids, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell electric vehicles – both have been caught flat-footed in the context of 2022. S&amp;P Global Mobility conquest data for Tesla's Model 3 and Y, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq5, and Chevrolet Bolt show strong captures of buyers from the two leading Japanese brands.Tesla's challengeSo far, most EVs continue to be acquired for higher MSRPs and by buyers with higher incomes than the demographic profile for total light vehicle registrations--in part because most EVs are Teslas.Of more than 525,000 EVs registered over the first nine months of 2022, nearly 340,000 were Teslas. The remaining volume is divided, very unevenly, among 46 other nameplates. However, the trends may change as the number of EV buyers becomes more robust.EV registrations shareTesla's position is changing as new, more affordable options arrive, offering equal or better technology and production build. Given that consumer choice and consumer interest in EVs are growing, Tesla's ability to retain a dominant market share will be challenged going forward.Story continuesS&amp;P Global Mobility predicts the number of battery-electric nameplates will grow from 48 at present to 159 by the end of 2025, at a pace faster than Tesla will be able to add factories. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk confirmed (again) during a recent earnings call that the company is working on a vehicle priced lower than the Model 3, though market launch timing is unclear.Tesla's model range is expected to grow to include Cybertruck in 2023 and eventually a Roadster, but largely the Tesla model lineup in 2025 will be the same models it offers today. (Tesla is also planning to deliver a commercial semi-truck by the end of 2022, but it would not be factored into light-vehicle registrations.)""Before you feel too badly for Tesla, however, remember that the brand will continue to see unit sales grow, even as share declines,"" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence for S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""The EV market in 2022 is a Tesla market, and it will continue to be, so long as its competitors are bound by production capacity.""Tesla has opened two new assembly plants in 2022 and is looking for the site of its next North American plant. Tesla today is the brand best equipped for taking advantage of the immediate surge in EV demand, though manufacturing investments from other automakers will erode this advantage sooner than later.The competitionThroughout 2022, EVs have gained market share and consumer attention. In an environment where vehicle sales are limited by inventory and availability, EVs have gained 2.4 points of market share year over year in registration data compiled through September – reaching 5.2% of all light vehicle registrations – according to S&amp;P Global Mobility data.The nascent stage of market growth leaves others competing for volume at the lower end of the price spectrum. New EVs from Hyundai, Kia and Volkswagen have joined Ford's Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Bolt (EV and EUV) and Nissan Leaf in the mainstream brand space. Meanwhile, luxury EVs from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Polestar, Lucid, and Rivian – as well as big-ticket items like the Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Hummer, and Chevrolet Silverado EV – will plague Tesla at the high end of the market.With the Model Y and Model 3 combined taking 56% of EV registrations, the other 46 vehicles are competing for scraps until EVs cross the chasm into mainstream appeal. (A recent S&amp;P Global Mobility analysis showed the Heartland states have yet to embrace electric vehicles.)""Evaluating EV market performance requires looking through a lower-volume lens than with traditional ICE products,"" Brinley said. ""But growth prospects for EV products are strong, investment is massive and the regulatory environment in the US and globally suggests that these are the solution for the future.""Production volumes today are restricted by factory capacity, the semiconductor shortage and other supply chain challenges, as well as consumer demand. But the issue of production capacity is being addressed, as automakers, battery manufacturers and suppliers pour billions into that side of the equation. Though there are many signals suggesting consumer demand is high and that more buyers may be willing to make the transition – and to do so faster than anticipated even a year ago.But consumer willingness to evolve to electrification remains the largest wildcard. Looking past Model Y and Model 3, no single model has achieved registrations above 30,000 units through the first three quarters of 2022. The second-best-selling EV brand in the US is Ford. However, Mach-E registrations of about 27,800 units are about 8% of the volume Tesla has captured, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility data.Tesla ConquestsTesla has four of the top five EV models by registration; in the sixth through 10th positions are the Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV, Hyundai Ioniq5, Kia EV6, Volkswagen ID.4 and Nissan Leaf. Through September, the Bolt has seen about 21,600 vehicles registered, Hyundai and Kia are in the 17,000-18,000-unit range, and VW approached 11,000 units. Including the tenth-place Leaf, no other EV has had registrations above 10,000 units over the first nine months of 2022.That said, there are caveats. Volkswagen's low volumes are affected by supply chain snarls and market allocations to more EV-friendly regions – issues Hyundai and Kia also face. However, VW's new ID.4 assembly line in Tennessee went live in October; the automaker said at the plant opening that it had 20,000 unfilled reservations and a plant capacity of 7,000 units per month.That should change the EV volume picture significantly. A look at the roughly 525,000 EVs registered over the first nine months of 2022 shows the EV market today remains in the hands of affluent buyers, who are spending more on their vehicles than ICE buyers.While logic dictates that further growth will require more EVs being offered in the $25,000-$40,000 price range, the willingness of buyers to spend more today reflects an aspirational nature to the choice.Tesla's EV-only strategy gives it a retention advantage – as few EV owners have returned to ICE powertrains. But as new EVs arrive, loyalty will be tested. Currently, the Model Y has a 60.5% -brand loyalty and had nearly 74% of buyers come from outside the brand (the conquest rate) – tops in the industry. Who is Tesla conquesting from? Toyota, Honda, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.  Toyota and Honda are only beginning to get into the EV market, though have yet to enter the fray in earnest.Future EV marketThe race to marketHonda owners in particular are showing an interest in electric vehicles. Unfortunately for Honda, its first EV (a midsize SUV shared with GM) isn't expected until 2024, whereupon the second half of this decade sees a flurry of activity. That still presents the challenge of reconnecting with owners who have defected from the Honda brand.In its meteoric growth, Tesla has conquested Japanese icons: The top five Model Y conquests are the Lexus RX, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Honda Odyssey, and Honda Accord. Meanwhile, the top five Model 3 conquests are the Honda Civic, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. So even though the overall market has ditched sedans for SUVs, there remain some who prefer a sedan in electrified form.But it's not just Tesla winning over consumers of the big two Japanese brands. Early data of the 27,800 registrations of the Ford Mustang Mach-E through September, shows similar conquest patterns: The top Mach-E conquest model has been the Toyota RAV4 (regardless of powertrain), followed by the Honda CR-V and Jeep Wrangler. The Mach-E is also experiencing registrations at a lower MSRP range – 43% of registrations had an MSRP below $50,000. For Ford, more than 63% of registrations from January through September 2022 were conquests from other brands.After the Mustang Mach-E, the next top EV is the Chevrolet Bolt (EUV and EV). The Bolt is likely to continue to gain ground, as it spent most of the fall and winter of 2021-22 in production hiatus as Chevrolet resolved a warranty issue, and then saw a price reduction soon after production re-started. With production back online, a more attractive price, and GM's plans to increase Bolt capacity in 2023, the vehicle has potential to keep growing. The Bolt also sees RAV4, CR-V and Prius as its top three conquest models.And while the Hyundai Ioniq5 is limited in its geographic distribution (and faces similar capacity and global demand issues as VW ID.4), S&amp;P Global Mobility conquest data show most Ioniq5 buyers previously owned a Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 or Subaru Forester. Of the top 10 Ioniq5 conquests, only two are from the traditional Detroit Three brands, with the Chevrolet Bolt at seventh and Jeep Wrangler at tenth.Of course, the high conquest rates from Toyota and Honda come from the historical sales success of those models overall. The RAV4 is the best-selling non-pickup truck in the US, which means there are more RAV4 buyers to conquest. The Camry, Accord, and CR-V follow close behind.Along this path, however, these EVs are seeing little conquest of the F-Series or Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. In the S&amp;P Global Mobility garage mate data, however, we see a strong F-Series representation. It shows up as a top garage mate for the Mustang Mach-E; the Bolt does see the Silverado as its top garage mate, the F-Series is next. F-Series is also the top garage mate for the Ioniq5, EV6 and ID.4.""Though today's EV buyers are not giving up their pickups in favor of going electric, it also suggests that there is a pool of EV owners, who are also full-size pickup owners, being created,"" Brinley said. ""We know that EV owners tend to be loyal to EV propulsion. This intersection can provide support for EV pickup adoption.""An existing pool of current EV owners who also have pickups can be a benefit for the efforts in the full-size EV pick-up space, particularly for the Ford F-150 Lightning, Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, each of which is aimed at a traditional pick-up use case and owner. The Rivian S1T, GMC Hummer EV and Tesla Cybertruck each occupy a lifestyle pickup space, geared toward innovator buyers and statement-makers, and could be more likely to conquest buyers to the pickup segment as well as to an EV purchase. But for now, electric vehicles remain the provenance of sedans and small SUVs.NOTE: All loyalty data is based on the S&amp;P Global Mobility household loyalty methodology, which may indicate an addition to the garage and not necessarily a disposal.  Please contact automotive@spglobal.com to find out more information around our insights to help you make data-driven decisions with conviction.Editor's Note: This report is from S&amp;P Global Mobility, and not S&amp;P Global Ratings, which is a separately managed division of S&amp;P Global.  About S&amp;P Global Mobility (www.spglobal.com/mobility)At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

If you want to read about some more consumer stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider.Consumer stocks are generally considered one of the safest investments at the stock market because of their predictable business models and relatively lower price volatility as compared to other sectors of the economy. Some examples of consumer industries include food and beverage producers, household item manufacturers, personal care product manufacturers, and tobacco companies. The consumer industry is also highly consolidated in nature, a key driver of demand for the sector in a volatile macro environment. Some of the top firms in this space are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). In the past few months, even as inflation impacts the short-term spending trends, there is a belief among experts that this sentiment might weigh on manufacturing stocks longer than expected. However, the long-term growth indicators for the industry remain overwhelmingly positive, making the sector a top retirement stock portfolio pick.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the consumer sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Consumer Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider11. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35  Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) operates as a food company worldwide. It is one of the best safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. It operates through four segments: Beef, Pork, Chicken, and Prepared Foods. On October 5, Tyson Foods noted that it is bringing all corporate teams to its headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. On November 3, Tyson Foods announced a partnership agreement with Tanmiah Food Co., producer and supplier of poultry and other meat products, to invest in the poultry capacity of Supreme Foods Processing Co. Story continuesThe firm has paid a dividend to shareholders for more than three decades. In the past ten years, this payout has registered consistent growth. On October 27, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery maintained a Neutral rating on Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stock and lowered the price target to $68 from $79, noting that the consumer demand in an inflationary environment remains at risk and falling prices will affect the firm’s chicken and beef segments.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 35 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.1 billion in Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), compared to 37 in the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion. Just like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is one of the safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. 10. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52  Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates as a general merchandise retailer in the United States. It is one of the top safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 26, Target Corporation revealed an expanded collaboration with Apple which includes a threefold increase in Apple at Target locations. The company said that it is offering the members of its loyalty program access to a four-month free trial of Apple Fitness+ with no purchase required. Target Corp has a dividend history stretching back more than fifty years. On August 18, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli maintained a Hold rating on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock and raised the price target to $165 from $150, noting that the company’s second quarter sales were in-line, but its earnings were still below the twice-revised forecast amid heavily marked down inventory clearing activity.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 52 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2 billion in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $1.3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Copper Companies in the World.Copper is the third most used metal in the world with Chile as its biggest producer and China as its biggest importer. Copper price saw its peak in April at about $10,000 per tonne and has since lost a third of its price. The main culprits in declining copper prices are the fear of global recession along with China’s zero COVID policy, leading to weaker demand from the country. Additionally, the macroeconomic pressures forced a mass sell-off on London Metal Exchange.Copper Demand and SupplyThe annual copper demand is expected to increase by 53% by 2040, mainly due to the electrification of vehicles. Global EV sales are expected to account for 40% of the total car sales by 2030. However, the world is looking at copper shortages in the near future.The copper inventories are near historical lows. On top of that, copper giants are expected to face production shortages in the future. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) recently halted its $2 billion copper and gold project in Peru. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) management says that the latest copper prices are not enough to put forward new investments. According to S&amp;P Global’s worst-case projection, the copper shortfall could reach around 20% of consumption by 2035. In 2021, the copper deficit was only 2% of the consumption, and it lead copper prices to increase by 25%. According to Goldman Sachs, the copper prices on the benchmark London Metal Exchange are expected to reach $15,000 by 2025.Among the top copper-producing companies are BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Vale S.A.

The partnership aims to promote the widespread adoption of virtual cards, easing business-to-business (B2B) travel payments.Mastercard gave a nod to make a minority investment in Conferma Pay as part of the recent tie-up. This decision seems a prudent move on MA’s part. The reason can be attributed to the extensive reach of Conferma Pay — purchased by Sabre in August 2022 — in the travel industry, enabling hassle-free connection between Conferma Pay-generated virtual card issuers and travel management companies, travel agencies, corporations, issuers and technology partners.Backed by Mastercard’s technology prowess, Conferma Pay can integrate new features into the virtual cards and upgrade the existing capabilities of the same. The virtual cards coming with great security and a single-use card number can be utilized for seamless booking and connected payments to third-party suppliers. Additionally, the buyers and suppliers operating in the travel space can keep an eye on payments, and enjoy benefits from flexible pricing and varied financing options.The latest alliance reflects Mastercard’s sincere efforts to leverage the collective experience, technology and capabilities of Sabre and Conferma Pay along with its own resources in infusing advanced digital solutions into the travel payment ecosystem. As travelers remain inclined toward using smart devices and electronic payments amid their journeys owing to the widespread adoption of digital means across every sphere of life, partnerships similar to the latest one seems aptly timed. Another factor that underlines the timeliness of the latest move is the significant surge in travel that might occur this year, thanks to the relaxation of border restrictions, pent-up demand for travel and the gradual resurgence of business or vocational trips.Mastercard frequently resorted to collaborations to upgrade the travel economy. In August 2022, MA teamed up with LMK Resources Pakistan (Private) Limited (LMKR) to execute the first open-loop payment solution, powered by MA’s advanced technology, across the transit system of Pakistan.Story continuesShares of Mastercard have gained 9.4% in a year against the industry’s decline of 10.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Markets are also awaiting key U.S. payrolls data later in the week.While the minutes of the Fed’s November meeting showed that a growing number of Fed members support smaller rate hikes in the coming months, Fed speakers have warned that stubborn inflation will likely keep U.S. rates elevated until well into 2024.This did little to curb a month-long rally in metal markets, as the prospect of a smaller rate hike in December offered much relief to non-yielding assets such as gold.Spot gold prices steadied around $1,748.99 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,747.30 an ounce. Both instruments jumped nearly 1% on Tuesday, and were set to rise around 7% for November- their strongest monthly gain since May 2021.But the outlook for gold still remains muted, given that U.S. inflation is trending well above the Fed’s annual target. Stubborn inflation could see the central bank tighten monetary policy further to bring down prices- a scenario that is negative for gold.The yellow metal fell sharply this year as rising interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell slightly on Wednesday, but were also set for their best month in 2022.Copper futures fell 0.1% to $3.6405 a pound, after rising 0.7% in the prior session. But they were set to rise nearly 8% in November- their best month since early-2021.Copper prices were largely boosted by speculation over the scaling back of COVID-related restrictions in major importer China.Story continuesThe world’s largest copper importer is facing increased public ire over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has driven speculation that the government will be forced to suspend restrictive measures.But Beijing has given no such indication so far, as the country grapples with a record-high daily increase in COVID-19 infections. This saw the reintroduction of strict movement curbs in several major cities over the past two months, which weighed heavily on China's economy.Related ArticlesGold, copper set for best month in 2022 on dovish Fed, China hopesU.S. senators introduce bill to expand E15 gasoline sales, with support from oil groupOil extends rebound on hopes of China reopening, OPEC cut speculation]"

Without government support, that could drop to 36% by the end of this decade, according to the analysis released by U.S. industry body Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting Group.The United States has already lost its lead in chip manufacturing, prompting the Biden administration to pass the CHIPS and Science Act this year. An earlier report by SIA and BCG in 2020 showed the U.S. share of modern global chip manufacturing capacity had fallen to 12% by that year, down from 37% in 1990.While companies like Intel Corp both design and manufacture chips, so-called fabless chipmakers like Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc design chips that are made by the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co..The report also said government support is helping companies in countries like China and South Korea to gain market share in chip designing as well.It said federal investment in semiconductor design and R&amp;D of $20 billion-$30 billion through 2030, including a $15 billion-$20 billion investment tax credit for chip design, would be needed to maintain U.S. leadership in the long-run.While the CHIPS and Science Act included $39 billion in manufacturing grants for chip production and $13 billion for R&amp;D, nothing was tagged for chip designing specifically, according to a spokesperson for SIA.The report also said the U.S. chip industry will face a shortage of 23,000 design workers by 2030, but funding from the federal government could help support training up a workforce.

But behind this simple-seeming fact are thousands of hours of inventing, testing, and problem-solving by some of the world's smartest people. Dr. Yeliz Tokgoz, Principal Engineer in the Wireless R&amp;D Division at Qualcomm, is one such bright mind who has dedicated her career to solving these fundamental cellular technology problems - and she can tell you exactly how much effort has gone into making sure your phone can connect smoothly and quickly to the cell network.The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.Thanks to your work in 5G, we benefit from all kinds of network enhancements. Can you tell us a little about what your 5G inventions enable for everyday users?Each new cellular generation is about solving problems and growing capabilities. These days, there are a lot more devices that need to be connected to the same cell network - and not just phones, but smartwatches, cameras, computers, security systems, and now even cars.With 5G, we've greatly enhanced mobile broadband network efficiency, coverage and data rates, but we also optimized support for diverse new devices and use cases to bring connectivity to every aspect of our lives. My work focused on providing that high-speed, reliable, and consistent wireless coverage, wherever you are - whether you're outside, close to a cell tower, in a busy city center or a rural area. This is the kind of fundamental end-to-end system-level approach we take, and have been since even my 3G days.Can you tell us a little about how coverage works in cellular technologies?Coverage is a complicated concept, but it generally revolves around the foundation of what your phone does: sending and receiving signals to a cell tower. It starts with network planning and deployment by the operator, where they want to place towers. If it's a very high-demand area, for example, operators must densify to be able to provide service to a large user base. We try to make their jobs easier with innovations that increase the efficiency of the networks and extend the coverage of each cell tower. Coverage is not just a matter of improving your signal, but also managing interference from other undesired signals- they work hand in hand. We want to make sure that operators can achieve good data rates even where the users are farthest from the cell tower and might experience interference from other towers in the vicinity.Story continuesThese cell towers often use highly directional transmissions based on massive MIMO technology. For example, one of the inventions I worked on involves determining the interference profile experienced by a device at different locations from the tower. This is done through identifying neighbor base stations and their directional transmit beams that might create interference. When a device wants to send and receive data at one of those vulnerable locations, coordination between base stations can be initiated to ensure that while that device is being served, neighbor base stations can avoid concentrating transmit power along the device's direction.The other side of the story is about spectrum. When you have a low-frequency spectrum, the propagation conditions are better, and you can get extended coverage. But low-frequency spectrum is very scarce - it's almost fully utilized - so there's not much available to address the increasing demand. With each generation, we're moving to higher and higher spectrum bands. Some of our innovations are related to making sure that we get comparable wide-area coverage at these high frequencies as we do with the low frequencies. We also work on how we can make best use of a range of different bands to optimize coverage and meet the requirements of the end-user. This is really hard to do - but at Qualcomm, hard problems always seem to have a way of getting solved.How would you describe the culture of innovation at Qualcomm?It's crucial to understand that we don't just sit around and come up with ideas, then say, ""Okay, let's do it this way."" Qualcomm is always at the forefront. A huge part of what we do is to simulate, analyze, enhance, prototype, and test our ideas. We have sophisticated analysis tools which allow us to test things in simulated environments - helping to refine our ideas faster. Often, we want to test these ideas in real-life environments. Because our ideas are quite cutting-edge, there aren't existing prototypes or test devices, so we just develop our own and try them out in our campus over-the-air network. These capabilities provide us with great insights into the problems of real systems, and how our ideas improve performance. It's not just an innovation for innovation's sake, but innovation to solve real-life problems in a practical manner.Do you have any unique perspectives or insights from your personal experience about being a woman inventor?Unfortunately, the gender gap is there. I see fewer females in my field and that naturally leads to having fewer female inventors. I personally have always considered myself fortunate to work at Qualcomm, because I've never felt any negative gender bias in my group. But the gender bias certainly exists in many places, and I think we should encourage women to be more confident and realize that they can be creative, effective problem solvers. Gender doesn't play a role in the invention process, right? I have two daughters and I'm encouraging them to go into STEM. Hopefully, with newfound awareness, this issue continues to improve and more girls will seek STEM careers.Learn more about the culture of innovation at QualcommRead more about other inventors at QualcommQualcomm, Tuesday, November 29, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.qualcomm.com/company/sustainabilityEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/729294/How-Qualcomm-Inventor-Dr-Yeliz-Tokgozs-Ideas-Improve-Coverage-and-Capacity-in-5G]"

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for QUALCOMM as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on QUALCOMM will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, QUALCOMM would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 45% gain to the company's bottom line. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 220% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 4.5% each year over the next three years. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 9.0% per annum.With this information, we are not surprised that QUALCOMM is trading at a P/E lower than the market. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.The Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of QUALCOMM's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with QUALCOMM (at least 2 which are a bit unpleasant), and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed defense analysis and go directly to 5 Biggest Militaries in the World. Military size has played a critical role throughout human history. However, as technology evolved, starting from the early modern period, it changed the landscape of warfare forever. The British were able to colonize much of the world with ease, despite being few in numbers relative to their subjects, because of advanced military technology. The Defense Industry: An AnalysisIn the present day, technological advantage has replaced the size advantage to a fairly large degree in most military doctrines. These doctrines are executed through investments in military R&amp;D. The global military spending grew by 0.7% in 2021, surpassing the $2 trillion figure. The US alone accounted for 38% of this global spending, with a 2021 military budget of a little over $800 billion. Most of these funds go into defense contract obligations. According to a report released by the US Department of Defense, 71% from the 'contract-obligations-and-payroll-spending' budget went to defense contractors. The report showed that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were the government’s top three defense contractors in 2021, respectively. This goes to show that technology matters much more than military size.There’s many technologies being developed but the ones that have the most to offer in terms of strategic advantages as of late are hypersonic scramjet missiles and glide vehicles, 5G, autonomous systems and AI. The US is already strategically matched by Russia and China in stealth, autonomous systems and air-defense technologies. However, Russia and China have a lead over it in hypersonics. In fact, the top DoD contracts are an effort to develop hypersonic technology. According to a DoD report, hypersonics R&amp;D cost the highest amount of money, at $3.2 billion, in US defense contracts for military technology in 2021. It was followed by autonomous systems &amp; AI, at $2.5 billion and 5G at $1.5 billion. Story continuesMost of the contracts for these novel technologies have been awarded to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Photo by Michael Afonso on UnsplashInsofar as autonomous weapon systems are concerned, even some mid-tier military powers have made significant strides. Turkish Baykar-Bayraktar-TB2 drones supplied to Ukrainian forces have been highly effective in their counter-offensives against Russia. On the other hand, Iranian Shahed-136 drones, which Iran has admitted to exporting to Russia, have been wreaking havoc in Ukrainian cities. When deployed autonomously, these drones can pick and choose their own targets within the mission parameters and so their low cost, autonomy  and group coordination makes them operationally scalable and highly effective.Now that we’re caught up with major global military developments, let’s head over to the list of 12 biggest militaries in the world. Our MethodologyFor our list of the 12 biggest militaries in the world, we’ve ranked them on a 2021-2022 quantitative basis but one that relates primarily to military equipment. We’ve focused on the number of aircraft (in the air force), naval ships (we’ve considered only strategic warships like frigates, cruisers, destroyers and corvettes). We’ve mentioned aircraft carriers and submarines separately for emphasis, tanks and secondarily, personnel (active and reserve).We’ve mentioned the number of strategic assets like nuclear weapons, submarines and aircraft carriers (if any) as well. We’ve also discussed their defense spending. With that said, here’s the 12 biggest militaries in the world: 12. IranStrategic Ballistic Missiles: 3000 Aircraft: 343 Tanks: 1513 Strategic Warships: 10 Submarines: 19Iran is located in West Asia and is the twelfth biggest military power in the world, going by their military arsenal. The country possesses 3,000 strategic missiles with varying range and payload capacity. It tops the range limit at 2,000 kilometers. While Iran currently doesn’t possess nuclear weapons, it has missiles in its arsenal capable of carrying nuclear payload.It has over 1,500 main-battle tanks, 7 frigates, 3 corvettes and 19 submarines. Iran’s aircraft inventory has 343 units in total as of 2021. These include fighters, bombers, multirole, attack aircraft, as well as tankers, transporters, patrol and electronics-warfare aircraft. Its top jets include Sukhoi 27, Mig-29 and F-14 Tomcat. Lastly, the country has close to 1 million personnel that includes both active and reserve military members. Iran is primarily engaged in a cold war in the Middle East against the US and Saudi Arabia, with theaters being Syria and Yemen and to some extent, Iraq.Most of the western military equipment in Iran made by companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is from the pre-Islamic-Revolution era. For instance, the F-14 Tomcat in Iran’s air fleet was made by Grumman Corporation. 11. North KoreaAircraft: 545 Tanks: 3500  Strategic Warships: 11 Submarines: 20 Nuclear Weapons: 50 (estimate figure)North Korea is located in East Asia. It is geopolitically isolated for the most part and has developed a huge military arsenal to counter what it claims are US and South Korean military threats to its sovereignty. It has roughly 3,500 main-battle tanks, 11 strategic warships, which include 3 frigates and 8 corvettes, 545 aircraft, Mig-29 being the premier fighter, and 71 submarines. Its Hwasong-17 missile has a range of over 15,000 kilometers.Its nuclear-weapon estimates, based on the amount of fissile material it possesses, put the number between 45 to 55. It is also one of the biggest militaries in terms of personnel, with its military being 1.9-million-strong as of 2021, including both active and reserve personnel. 10. IsraelAircraft: 334 Tanks: 1370  Strategic Warships: 17 Submarines: 5 Nuclear Weapons: 90 (estimate figure)Israel is a powerful military force in the Middle East. Israel and its neighboring countries have historically had a hostile relationship due to its UN-recognized occupation of Palestine. Its geography, coupled with its lack of strategic depth, makes it enormously vulnerable in the face of a large-scale attack. This has led Israel to develop an aggressive military doctrine based around preemptive measures and technological advantage, and as a result, it has had success in military conflicts against multiple countries. For instance, it was able to defeat the coalition of Jordan, Syria and Egypt in the Six Day War. Israel is perhaps the best example of the fact that size doesn’t matter anymore. Regardless, its military has become sizable over the past 20 or so years. The country spent 2.8% of its 2021 GDP for its military capability. It operates 17 strategic warships, including frigates, corvettes and missile boats, 1,370 tanks and 334 aircraft as of 2022. Its aircraft inventory includes jets like F-16, different variants of F-15 and the fifth generation stealth aircraft F-35 Lightning-II.It has opted for strategic ambiguity on the possession of nuclear weapons but effectively has an estimated 90 nuclear weapons as of 2022. It has close to 0.6 million military personnel, with 73% of it being the reserve personnel. 9. PakistanAircraft: 431 Tanks: 4148 Strategic Warships: 18 Submarines: 8 Nuclear Weapons: 165Pakistan is one of the strongest military powers in Asia. The country has historically had a rocky relationship with neighboring India over Kashmir, leading to three wars. This has led Pakistan to develop a powerful military arsenal. Its military doctrine was based on conventional war with India, but instability in the neighboring Afghanistan and the resulting insurgency in Pakistan’s FATA during War on Terror led the country to develop counter-insurgency capability as well. Pakistan maintains 165 nuclear warheads as of 2021, a vast array of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, nearly 4,200 tanks, 97 attack helicopters, 8 submarines and 18 strategic warships including 10 frigates, 2 destroyers and 6 corvettes. Its aircraft inventory consists of 431 aircraft and spans attack, multirole, bomber and utility airplanes. Its notable fighters include the F-16 Falcon and JF-17 Thunder. Pakistan has 1.2 million military personnel, with more than half being on active duty. 8. FranceAircraft Carriers: 1 Aircraft: 333 Tanks: 222 Strategic Warships: 27 Submarines: 10 Nuclear Weapons: 290 Military Satellites: 7France is one of the two most capable military powers in Europe, the other being the UK. France has invested extensively in its military arsenal under the leadership of Macron, in order to realize 'strategic autonomy' from the US-led NATO. The country maintains an operational aircraft carrier, a total of 290 nuclear warheads, 27 warships including 3 destroyers, 18 frigates and 6 corvettes, 333 aircraft and 67 attack helicopters.

This will take the annual payment to 2.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Lockheed Martin's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 30.5% over the next year.

The annual payment during the last 10 years was $4.00 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $12.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Lockheed Martin has been growing its earnings per share at 12% a year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.Lockheed Martin Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash.

However, around December 2021, the focus shifted more to treatments that patients can take after contracting the disease to prevent severe sickness and hospitalization.Merck &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was the first to apply for emergency use authorization for a Covid pill called molnupiravir under the brand name Lagevrio. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) subsequently applied for approval for a pill-based treatment under brand name Paxlovid.MRK 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MRKPeter Lynch Chart of MRKMerck is one of the largest and oldest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The pharma segment provides drugs in the areas of oncology, hospital acute care, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular and diabetes. The company also has an animal health segment which develops and markets veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines and other health management solutions and services.The company was founded in 1891 and currently has a market capitalization of $275 billion, putting it at all-time highs. However, total revenues could approach $59 billion in 2022, and the company's earnings growth means it is trading roughly in line with historical average valuation levels. Thus, could the stock still be fairly valued?Covid drug operating resultsEarly reports showed the Merck Covid pill cut the risk of hospitalization and death from Covid by 50% in patients who had mild-to-moderate Covid-19 symtoms, but a final analysis of the trial reported in November, before the FDA and EU authorization, showed a reduction in that benefit to 30%.Nonethelesss, molnupiravir became a big seller and is expected to bring in between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion in revenues in 2022. The next year should see a sharp drop-off in molnupiravir sales as more people will have already caught Covid, causing new cases continue to decline. Competition from Pfizers Paxlovid also remains a factor.Story continuesFinancial summaryThe company reports financial operating results both including molnupiravir and excluding the drug. Revenues increased 14% when including the Covid-19 treatment drug and increased 10% without it in its most recent quarterly earnings report. The companys leading anti-cancer drug Keytruda, in comparison, showed a constant-currency sales increase of 26%.Merck reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.28 for the quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.85. The non-GAAP EPS was an increase of 7.0% compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP EPS excludes non-recurring charges, primarily in the areas of merger and acquisition charges and restructuring expenses.The company typically generates very strong levels of free cash flow. For the first nine months of 2022, operating cash flow was $14.7 billion and capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, which created free cash flow of approximately $11.5 billion. During the first period, the company paid down debt in the amount of $2.2 billion and bought back $5.2 billion in common shares.The company maintains a safe balance sheet with $11.1 billion in cash and $30.4 billion in total debt. With $27 billion in Ebitda, the companys debt ratings are strongly investment grade.CEO Robert Davis stated on the recent earnings report:We continue to execute on our strategy, invest in leading-edge science and drive innovation as our colleagues deliver meaningful value for patients which in turn provides value for our shareholders. Our third quarter results demonstrate exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth and sustained performance across our key growth drivers. Inspired by our purpose of saving and improving lives around the world, I am confident we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong operational performance.ValuationThe company recently raised it full-year 2022 guidance and now expects revenue between $58.5 billion and $59.0 billion, which represents approximately 12% growth excluding molnupiravir. Earnings per share guidance was raised slightly to the range of $7.32 to $7.37 (non-GAAP). Analyst consensus calls for 2022 earnings per share of $7.38, which puts Merck's stock price at 14.7 times this year's earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to increase again in 2023 in the $7.55 to $7.60 range according to analysts. The company's enterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratio is approximately 11 based on 2022 Ebitda estimates.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator gives a fair value close to the current stock price when using $7.38 as the starting point, a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.0% and a discount rate of 10%.The company currently pays an annualized dividend of $2.76 which equates to a 2.57% dividend yield. The payout ratio is well below 50% based on current earnings estimates. Merck has been paying dividends for well over 30 years.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased Merck stock or added to their positions recently include Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio) and Private Capital (Trades, Portfolio). Gurus who have reduced their Merck holdings include Dodge &amp; Cox and Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio).Growth drives could disappearMerck stock is trading near all-highs but still maintains reasonable valuation levels. However, most major long-term catalysts have either occurred or are well known to the investor community.For long-term investors, its important to note that the key growth driver for the company, Keytruda, has a patent expiration in 2028. This cliff will be hard to overcome without a major acquisition, and earnings will likely decline at the point.Investors should wait for a lower entry point as the stock will likely not continue to make new all-time highs for any extended period going forward.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

In 2021 alone, an estimated 1.5 million people worldwide were newly diagnosed with HIV.Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Tuesday, November 29, 2022, Press release pictureMerck has been committed to advancing science for the treatment and prevention of HIV for more than 35 years, but we know it takes more - it takes all of us to make a difference for the HIV community.And that's just what these International AIDS Society (IAS) Young Leaders are doing. In 2022, Merck was proud to sponsor 11 Young Leaders to co-create the Youth Hub - a youth-led networking platform that empowers young change makers living with and affected by HIV to lead in the HIV response. Merck was privileged to meet this class of leaders at the AIDS 2022 conference in Montreal. They are an inspiring group of advocates with different backgrounds and experiences in the response to HIV, each striving to empower and educate others from their respective corners of the globe.Let's meet a few of these young change makers.Ashley Rose Murphy | CanadaAshley was 7 years old when her adoptive parents told her she was living with HIV. But Ashley didn't hide from her diagnosis. Even at a young age, she knew she was destined for more. By the age of 10, she began to speak publicly about living with HIV, talking to young people around the world about the stigma around HIV and how to protect and advocate for themselves. She's been a key voice for youth activists engaged in the HIV response in Canada ever since, presenting on stages like the UN General Assembly and the Global Fund and even hosting a TED Talk.Today Ashley, now 24, is an ambassador for Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research (CANFAR), and UNAIDS, which are committed to ending the AIDS epidemic either locally or globally through research, government-funded programs, global advocacy, prevention, testing and treatment options. Ashley remains an inspiration for all young Canadians living with or affected by HIV.Story continues""I want everyone to know that an HIV diagnosis does not have to be the end of the world. We can all continue to live healthy and fulfilling lives, but it starts with educating yourself about your diagnosis and, most importantly, being your own advocate."" - Ashley Rose MurphyPaul Mavesere Ndhlovu | ZimbabwePaul has been using his voice - in more than one way - to help young people living with and at risk of HIV in his native Zimbabwe for years. Over the past several years, Paul has produced a peer-led radio show as the creative radio champion for Zvandiri, an organization that ""connects children and young people living with HIV with peer counsellors to assure health, happiness and hope.""In his role, Paul - together with other adolescents and young people - has created a youth-friendly environment for people living with HIV to freely discuss challenges and issues in their own lives. The show explains to young people the importance of HIV prevention behaviors, the need for increased HIV testing, their sexual and reproductive rights, and available resources to help with mental health and wellbeing needs. In fact, at the International AIDS 2022 conference, Paul was selected to represent the voices and experiences of young people living with HIV and showcase the power of youth within the HIV response. He presented in 6 sessions. Paul has also been chosen from over 5000 applicants to be one of 17 United Nations Young Leaders for the Sustainable Development Goals, a flagship initiative of the Office of the Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth.""The Zvandiri Radio Show is such an important platform. I've seen firsthand how difficult it can be for young people to talk about their status due to fear of being looked at or treated differently by their peers. We are providing an open forum for people living with HIV to freely come as themselves and talk about any challenges they may face."" - Paul Mavesere NdhlovuStefano Regner | PhilippinesStefano's schedule is always busy, and as a ""friendly next-door"" physiotherapist and sexual health advocate, his work revolves around helping others.As a trained HIV screener, counselor, and speaker with LoveYourself Inc., Stefano is constantly on the move - traveling across the Philippines to help link people living with HIV to immediate care and empowering individuals when it comes to understanding safe sex. He has also previously worked as a research assistant for one of the Philippines' largest grassroots HIV test-and-treat centers.And today, as both a medical student and a social media influencer, Stefano invests time and effort into providing educational resources for people living with HIV using health campaigns and videos.""Social media provides a new platform and method to translate and communicate important topics about health and increasing health literacy. I enjoy sharing key information with my followers, especially as it relates to sexual and reproductive health among at-risk populations in the Philippines."" - Stefano RegnerKalisito Biaukula | FijiKalisito's motivation to help give a voice to the voiceless and speak up for those in need is evidenced by their work across their island nation of Fiji and the surrounding regions.As an intersectional, queer, feminist activist and human rights defender, Kalisito has worked with various civil society organizations working with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC+) in Asia and the Pacific, primarily focused on addressing intersecting human rights issues.Kalisito has dedicated most of their time to volunteering for various feminist-led civil society organizations, especially those working with key populations in the HIV response. They are a major advocate for people living with and impacted by HIV, fighting to ensure that they are receiving the proper care and government assistance that is needed and calling for comprehensive sexuality education at all levels.""It's important for young people, especially those living in the Asia-Pacific region, to take a leading role in decisions that affect our bodies. We must all use our voices to stand up for human rights and ensure all populations are receiving equal opportunities to access care and programs in this ongoing response to HIV."" - Kalisito BiaukulaSara Thapa Magar | NepalFrom a young age, Sara developed an interest in social issues related to women and children living with HIV. This passion eventually led her to begin advocating on both national and international platforms for the needs and rights of affected populations living in the Asia-Pacific region.Throughout her years as a gender and HIV advocate, Sara has been a board member of the International Community of Women Living with HIV Asia &amp; Pacific (ICWAP) and has also spoken publicly about the need to support women-led organizations in their frontline role. In her current role as president of National Federation of Women Living with HIV and AIDS (NFWLHA) in Nepal, Sara works to tackle gender inequalities and end gender-based violence, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.""In Nepal, we continue to see gender-based violence against women living with HIV. As youth leaders, we need to continue bringing these issues to the forefront and work to partner with the government and advocacy groups to address the challenges of women and children living with HIV."" - Sara Thapa MagarThe future is in good hands with these young leaders, advocates and activists, and we are excited to continue to watch the impact they make on their local and global communities.

168,df617f55-fe55-33e2-b0bc-cfbc3f119af8,MRK,2022-11-30,FOCUS-Rare success for Alzheimer's research unlocks hope for future therapies,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-rare-success-alzheimers-research-153850871.html,1669736330,STORY,"['BIIB', 'MRK']","[(Adds report of patient deaths)By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The first big breakthrough in 30 years of Alzheimer’s research is providing momentum for clinical trials of “cocktail” treatments targeting the two hallmark proteins associated with the mind-robbing disease, according to interviews with researchers and pharmaceutical executives.Drugmakers Eisai Co Ltd and Biogenreported in September that their therapy lecanemab could slow progress of the disease by 27% over 18 months compared with a placebo [.The finding validates the theory that clearing the amyloid protein that forms clumps in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients could slow or halt the disease and has strengthened the support from some scientists for simultaneously targeting another notorious protein linked to Alzheimer's: tau.Eisai and Biogen are scheduled to present full data from their lecanemab study on Tuesday at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference in San Francisco. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision by early January on the companies’ application for accelerated approval.If approved on an accelerated basis, the companies said they would immediately apply for full U.S. regulatory approval which could help secure Medicare coverage. To date, two deaths have been reported among patients who received lecanemab in conjunction with medicine to prevent or clear blood clots, though industry analysts do not expect those developments alone to prevent approval.""I think lecanemab has reinvigorated the idea that now you could do a combination of amyloid (and) tau,” Dr. Reisa Sperling, a neurologist and Alzheimer’s researcher at Harvard Medical School, said in an interview.Tau naturally accumulates in a memory center of the brain called the medial temporal lobe as people age. A growing body of research suggests that rising levels of amyloid in Alzheimer’s patients act as an accelerant, causing an explosive spread of tau that forms toxic tangles inside brain cells, eventually killing them.Story continues“We've been trying to do combination trials for years,” Sperling said. Nearly a decade ago, Alzheimer’s experts met in Washington to discuss testing combined therapies. At the time, “no one would listen,” she said.Now, however, Sperling and other researchers in the Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC), a research network backed by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), say drugmakers are increasingly interested in participating in a study to test tau drugs alone and in combination with anti-amyloid drugs such as lecanemab.“We've been talking to multiple companies about working with us on our proposed platform, which can evaluate multiple drugs, and everybody's interested,” said Dr. Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, and a leader with Sperling of the ACTC.The scientists said they expect an answer on funding by year-end. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, which oversees NIA, said it does not discuss grants under review.BILLIONS SPENTMore than 6 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, costing the U.S. economy nearly $6 billion a year in direct spending and unpaid caregiving expenses, according to congressional briefing documents. By 2050, Alzheimer’s cases are expected to double to 12.7 million, bringing the total yearly cost to nearly $1 trillion, according to the documents.Last year, the FDA gave Biogen and Eisai’s drug aducanumab conditional approval even though it failed one of its two late-stage trials. The approval was based on the drug’s ability to remove amyloid from the brain.Biogen initially priced the drug at $56,000 a year, but the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it needed more compelling evidence, and that Medicare would only cover the drug for use in clinical trials.Lecanemab’s success rests on years of research into the causes of Alzheimer’s as well as advances in measuring amyloid deposits through brain scans and spinal fluids. Trials of tau drugs will aim to build on that progress, using brain scans, spinal fluids and blood tests to better assess the stage of disease, when to intervene and whether the drug is hitting its target. That would allow companies to test drugs even before symptoms emerge.Nearly a dozen drugmakers, including Roche, Merck &amp; Co, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Eli Lilly and Co, are working on therapies that target tau. At least 16 treatments are being tested in clinical trials, with results expected over the next three years, according to a Reuters review of the clinicaltrials.gov registry.Merck is testing its MK-2214 therapy aimed at clearing tau in patients in very early stages of the disease in several small trials.""The understanding of the disease is getting much, much better,"" said Jason Uslaner, Merck’s head of discovery neuroscience. The drugmaker has been largely absent from the Alzheimer's space after the high-profile failure of its drug verubecestat five years ago.So far, only a few trials combine an amyloid-lowering therapy with a drug that targets tau in a “cocktail” approach, similar to those used against cancers and HIV.Such combinations may improve on the benefit of lowering amyloid alone in people who have symptoms, researchers told Reuters. And when used earlier in the disease, the hope is that they might prevent dementia altogether.“It may be that you need both - the removal of amyloid that's driving that biological cascade - and you need to clean up any tau that's already spreading from one cell to another,” said Dr. Adam Boxer, a tau expert at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center.But several antibody therapies from Lilly, Biogen and AbbVie that were designed to slow the rate of tau accumulations failed outright last year. A drug from Roche, semorinemab, showed limited effectiveness.""It took maybe 20 or 30 years before we found a drug that really targeted the right form of amyloid to make a difference,” Boxer said. “It’s still early days.” (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Suzanne Goldenberg)]"

(MRK) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-merck-co-140002489.html,1669730402,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +7.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.38 points to a change of +22.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 indicates a change of -0.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.4%. The $59.16 billion and $58.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.9% and -1.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.43%. The EPS surprise was +10.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

174,be563b00-58b5-3997-94d1-29858351f7cd,BA,2022-11-30,12 Biggest Militaries in the World: Does Size Matter?,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-biggest-militaries-world-does-195236601.html,1669751556,STORY,"['BA', 'RTX', 'LMT', 'NOC']","[In this article, we take a look at 12 biggest militaries in the world and whether or not military size is still a strategic edge. You can skip our detailed defense analysis and go directly to 5 Biggest Militaries in the World. Military size has played a critical role throughout human history. However, as technology evolved, starting from the early modern period, it changed the landscape of warfare forever. The British were able to colonize much of the world with ease, despite being few in numbers relative to their subjects, because of advanced military technology. The Defense Industry: An AnalysisIn the present day, technological advantage has replaced the size advantage to a fairly large degree in most military doctrines. These doctrines are executed through investments in military R&amp;D. The global military spending grew by 0.7% in 2021, surpassing the $2 trillion figure. The US alone accounted for 38% of this global spending, with a 2021 military budget of a little over $800 billion. Most of these funds go into defense contract obligations. According to a report released by the US Department of Defense, 71% from the 'contract-obligations-and-payroll-spending' budget went to defense contractors. The report showed that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were the government’s top three defense contractors in 2021, respectively. This goes to show that technology matters much more than military size.There’s many technologies being developed but the ones that have the most to offer in terms of strategic advantages as of late are hypersonic scramjet missiles and glide vehicles, 5G, autonomous systems and AI. The US is already strategically matched by Russia and China in stealth, autonomous systems and air-defense technologies. However, Russia and China have a lead over it in hypersonics. In fact, the top DoD contracts are an effort to develop hypersonic technology. According to a DoD report, hypersonics R&amp;D cost the highest amount of money, at $3.2 billion, in US defense contracts for military technology in 2021. It was followed by autonomous systems &amp; AI, at $2.5 billion and 5G at $1.5 billion. Story continuesMost of the contracts for these novel technologies have been awarded to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Photo by Michael Afonso on UnsplashInsofar as autonomous weapon systems are concerned, even some mid-tier military powers have made significant strides. Turkish Baykar-Bayraktar-TB2 drones supplied to Ukrainian forces have been highly effective in their counter-offensives against Russia. On the other hand, Iranian Shahed-136 drones, which Iran has admitted to exporting to Russia, have been wreaking havoc in Ukrainian cities. When deployed autonomously, these drones can pick and choose their own targets within the mission parameters and so their low cost, autonomy  and group coordination makes them operationally scalable and highly effective.Now that we’re caught up with major global military developments, let’s head over to the list of 12 biggest militaries in the world. Our MethodologyFor our list of the 12 biggest militaries in the world, we’ve ranked them on a 2021-2022 quantitative basis but one that relates primarily to military equipment. We’ve focused on the number of aircraft (in the air force), naval ships (we’ve considered only strategic warships like frigates, cruisers, destroyers and corvettes). We’ve mentioned aircraft carriers and submarines separately for emphasis, tanks and secondarily, personnel (active and reserve).We’ve mentioned the number of strategic assets like nuclear weapons, submarines and aircraft carriers (if any) as well. We’ve also discussed their defense spending. With that said, here’s the 12 biggest militaries in the world: 12. IranStrategic Ballistic Missiles: 3000 Aircraft: 343 Tanks: 1513 Strategic Warships: 10 Submarines: 19Iran is located in West Asia and is the twelfth biggest military power in the world, going by their military arsenal. The country possesses 3,000 strategic missiles with varying range and payload capacity. It tops the range limit at 2,000 kilometers. While Iran currently doesn’t possess nuclear weapons, it has missiles in its arsenal capable of carrying nuclear payload.It has over 1,500 main-battle tanks, 7 frigates, 3 corvettes and 19 submarines. Iran’s aircraft inventory has 343 units in total as of 2021. These include fighters, bombers, multirole, attack aircraft, as well as tankers, transporters, patrol and electronics-warfare aircraft. Its top jets include Sukhoi 27, Mig-29 and F-14 Tomcat. Lastly, the country has close to 1 million personnel that includes both active and reserve military members. Iran is primarily engaged in a cold war in the Middle East against the US and Saudi Arabia, with theaters being Syria and Yemen and to some extent, Iraq.Most of the western military equipment in Iran made by companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is from the pre-Islamic-Revolution era. For instance, the F-14 Tomcat in Iran’s air fleet was made by Grumman Corporation. 11. North KoreaAircraft: 545 Tanks: 3500  Strategic Warships: 11 Submarines: 20 Nuclear Weapons: 50 (estimate figure)North Korea is located in East Asia. It is geopolitically isolated for the most part and has developed a huge military arsenal to counter what it claims are US and South Korean military threats to its sovereignty. It has roughly 3,500 main-battle tanks, 11 strategic warships, which include 3 frigates and 8 corvettes, 545 aircraft, Mig-29 being the premier fighter, and 71 submarines. Its Hwasong-17 missile has a range of over 15,000 kilometers.Its nuclear-weapon estimates, based on the amount of fissile material it possesses, put the number between 45 to 55. It is also one of the biggest militaries in terms of personnel, with its military being 1.9-million-strong as of 2021, including both active and reserve personnel. 10. IsraelAircraft: 334 Tanks: 1370  Strategic Warships: 17 Submarines: 5 Nuclear Weapons: 90 (estimate figure)Israel is a powerful military force in the Middle East. Israel and its neighboring countries have historically had a hostile relationship due to its UN-recognized occupation of Palestine. Its geography, coupled with its lack of strategic depth, makes it enormously vulnerable in the face of a large-scale attack. This has led Israel to develop an aggressive military doctrine based around preemptive measures and technological advantage, and as a result, it has had success in military conflicts against multiple countries. For instance, it was able to defeat the coalition of Jordan, Syria and Egypt in the Six Day War. Israel is perhaps the best example of the fact that size doesn’t matter anymore. Regardless, its military has become sizable over the past 20 or so years. The country spent 2.8% of its 2021 GDP for its military capability. It operates 17 strategic warships, including frigates, corvettes and missile boats, 1,370 tanks and 334 aircraft as of 2022. Its aircraft inventory includes jets like F-16, different variants of F-15 and the fifth generation stealth aircraft F-35 Lightning-II.It has opted for strategic ambiguity on the possession of nuclear weapons but effectively has an estimated 90 nuclear weapons as of 2022. It has close to 0.6 million military personnel, with 73% of it being the reserve personnel. 9. PakistanAircraft: 431 Tanks: 4148 Strategic Warships: 18 Submarines: 8 Nuclear Weapons: 165Pakistan is one of the strongest military powers in Asia. The country has historically had a rocky relationship with neighboring India over Kashmir, leading to three wars. This has led Pakistan to develop a powerful military arsenal. Its military doctrine was based on conventional war with India, but instability in the neighboring Afghanistan and the resulting insurgency in Pakistan’s FATA during War on Terror led the country to develop counter-insurgency capability as well. Pakistan maintains 165 nuclear warheads as of 2021, a vast array of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, nearly 4,200 tanks, 97 attack helicopters, 8 submarines and 18 strategic warships including 10 frigates, 2 destroyers and 6 corvettes. Its aircraft inventory consists of 431 aircraft and spans attack, multirole, bomber and utility airplanes. Its notable fighters include the F-16 Falcon and JF-17 Thunder. Pakistan has 1.2 million military personnel, with more than half being on active duty. 8. FranceAircraft Carriers: 1 Aircraft: 333 Tanks: 222 Strategic Warships: 27 Submarines: 10 Nuclear Weapons: 290 Military Satellites: 7France is one of the two most capable military powers in Europe, the other being the UK.

South KoreaAircraft: 595 Tanks: 2321 Strategic Warships: 35 Submarines: 17South Korea borders North Korea and has historically had a tense relationship with its northern counterpart. This is why the country has invested heavily into its military to keep North Korean ambitions in check. In 2021, it dedicated 2.8% of its GDP to defense spending. South Korea boasts an air fleet of 595 aircraft as of 2021. Its notable fighting aircraft include F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon and the fifth generation stealth aircraft F-35 Lightning II. In terms of strategic warships, South Korea’s naval fleet consists of 3 cruisers, 6 destroyers, 14 frigates and 12 corvettes.Its military power on land is primarily bolstered by over 2,000 main-battle tanks. South Korea’s military is manned by 5,50,000 personnel. Its reserve force is one of the biggest in the world, with 2.75 million personnel as of 2020.6. JapanAircraft Carriers: 2 Aircraft: 606 Tanks: 580 Strategic Warships: 44 Submarines: 22Japan’s huge economy, coupled with regional threats, has allowed it to become one of the biggest militaries in the world. The country projects power in the Pacific using two Izumo-class aircraft carriers, with a third one under construction. The aircraft carriers are designed with helicopters in mind but Japan has repurposed them for the fifth generation F-35B Lightning-II Joint Strike Fighters as well. In addition to carriers, Japan’s other strategic ships include 38 destroyers and 6 frigates. Its air fleet has 606 aircraft as of 2022. Notable fighters in Japan’s air force include the F15 Eagle, and the F-2, jointly made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (OTCMKTS:MHVYF).

(GTS), together with the anticipated acquisition of Central Valley Gas Storage (CVGS), from Southern Company (NYSE: SO) affiliates, targets two regions with increasing demand for storage to support variable power loads, natural gas liquefaction, and high penetrations of renewable resources.  Acquisition amounts funded and/or anticipated to be funded by OIC, GCM Grosvenor, and Caliche management collectively total $186 million, which represents the aggregate purchase price of both GTS and CVGS, plus working capital and other adjustments. Caliche expects, with support from OIC and GCM Grosvenor, to explore and assess additional growth related to these assets and in these regions.  The GTS transaction closed on November 18, 2022, and the CVGS purchase, which requires state regulatory approvals, is expected to close in 2023.""We are thrilled to partner with the Caliche team again and with GCM Grosvenor to build off the success of Caliche I,"" said Ethan Shoemaker, Investment Partner and Head of Infra Credit at OIC.  ""GTS and CVGS are both premier storage assets and provide critical infrastructure for reliability in their respective markets.  We look forward to supporting Caliche II's continued growth as we expand the platform for other customers and into new products.""Story continues""We believe the investment opportunity for underground storage is robust in light of market dynamics and ongoing energy transition initiatives across the globe,"" said Matthew Rinklin, Managing Director at GCM Grosvenor.

While it’s no guarantee, the festive holiday spirit seems to have lifted moods. As an example, the technology-centric Nasdaq Composite posted a gain of 3% in the trailing month. True, that’s not a performance to write home about. At the same time, it demonstrates that the sharp losses that tech stocks incurred have been at least temporarily arrested. Now, the sector needs to pull off some key victories, which may lift broader investor sentiment. From there, who knows what can happen?For this list, I’m going to focus on generally underappreciated tech stocks. Fundamentally flying under the radar, these market ideas own the necessary ingredients for huge moves: relevant businesses, relatively strong financials, and a dose of underdog energy.KLICKulicke and Soffa$47.09SIMOSilicon Motion Technology$61.25CCRDCoreCard$29.90SWKSSkyworks Solutions$92.91LRCXLam Research$453.25CRUSCirrus Logic$75.11SPNSSapiens International$19.24InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTech Stocks to Buy: Kulicke &amp; Soffa (KLIC)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in Singapore, Kulicke &amp; Soffa Industries (NASDAQ:KLIC) doesn’t get much attention from stateside investors. However, that could change quickly. While KLIC represents one of the hard-hit tech stocks – suffering a 27% loss on a year-to-date basis – it also received near-term momentum. In the trailing five days, shares gained almost 9% while over the trailing month, they’re up over 14%.Fundamentally, KLIC should prove incredibly relevant. Per its public profile, the company is a leading provider of semiconductor, LED, and electronic assembly solutions serving the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing, and industrial markets. Unless you anticipate that these sectors will suffer a substantial loss of demand, KLIC should be able to keep on running. On a financial level, KLIC draws intrigue because of its business profile. Currently, the market prices KLIC at 6.65 times trailing 12-month earnings. In contrast, the industry’s median price-earnings ratio pings at 17.4 times.Story continuesTech Stocks to Buy: Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO)a close up image of a semiconductorSource: ShutterstockBased out of Taiwan, Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) naturally suffered from both the malaise impacting tech stocks and geopolitical pressures. With tensions sky-high between China and Taiwan, SIMO doesn’t provide much confidence. As a result, shares gave up over 35% of equity value since the start of the year. At the same time, SIMO gained almost 16% in the trailing month, reflecting rising near-term momentum heading into Dec.Fundamentally, Silicon Motion draws attention because it specializes in developing NAND flash controller integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. According to experts in the field, the global solid-state drive market might reach $175.9 billion by 2030 from $40.7 billion in 2021. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.6%. On a financial level, SIMO represents one of the top tech stocks that could make big moves in Dec. because of resilience. Per Gurufocus.com, the company carries zero debt, affording it incredible flexibility during these uncertain times.Tech Stocks to Buy: CoreCard (CCRD)APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Norcross, Georgia, CoreCard (NYSE:CCRD) absorbed a sizable hit similar to other tech stocks. Currently, shares fell over 22% since the January opener. However, CCRD features a market capitalization of only $254.5 million. As one of the smaller firms, it capitalizes on broader positive sentiment. Sure enough, in the trailing month, CCRD gained nearly 33%.That’s hefty momentum heading into Dec. As well, the fundamentals could serve the company well. Specifically, CoreCard focuses on the card management system, delivering powerful and integrated solutions for any type of card-issuing program. According to one research paper, the card management system market could hit $39.77 billion in 2027. Another reason to keep tabs on CCRD as one of the tech stocks to buy centers on its income statement. Presently, CoreCard’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 34.6%, beating out 88% of its peers. As well, its net margin is 23.2%, above 93% of the industry.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)Here's How Broadcom Stock Fell Back into Favor with InvestorsSource: ©iStock.com/lef2481Perhaps one of the more attractive tech stocks poised for big moves in Dec., Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) nevertheless represents a contrarian argument. At the moment, prospective investors are staring at a loss nearing 41%. However, in the trailing half-year period, SKWS cut this loss to only 6.6%. Part of the recovery stems from significant near-term momentum. In the trailing month, shares are up 9.6%.A semiconductor firm, Skyworks manufactures chips for use in radio frequency and mobile communications systems. Obviously, these segments command serious relevance, affording a long upside pathway for SWKS. For example, just the 5G Internet of Things market could reach a valuation of over $297 billion by 2030. While many reasons to bet on SWKS exist for contrarians, a top consideration focuses on an excellent value. Currently, the market prices SKWS at 9.2 times forward earnings. In contrast, the underlying industry’s forward PE ratio pings at 18 times.Lam Research (LRCX)silicon wafer in die attach machine in semiconductor manufacturingSource: ShutterstockArguably one of the more overlooked tech stocks, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) so far is getting a raw deal from Wall Street. As I write this, LRCX stock gave up over 36% of its equity value. However, in the trailing six months, LRCX managed to cut this loss to only 5.4% down. Further, in the trailing month, shares gained more than 21%. Again, that’s plenty of momentum to carry into Dec. Fundamentally, Lam Research supplies wafer fabrication equipment and related services to the semiconductor industry. As you might suspect, the company commands serious relevance. Per Allied Market Research, experts project that the global semiconductor wafer market will reach a valuation of $27.13 billion by 2030.Financially, Lam brings excellent income statement metrics. Its three-year revenue growth rate (26.6%) and net margin (27%) both rank among the sector’s upper echelons. Also, the market prices LRCX at 13.3 times forward earnings. For context, the median forward PE for the industry is 18 times.Cirrus Logic (CRUS)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Austin, Texas, Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) might not represent a household name among tech stocks. However, it deserves closer inspection for those seeking a smart but overlooked market idea. While shares slipped over 18% of equity value since the start of the year, they’ve gained over 12% in the trailing month. Also, in the past five sessions, CRUS jumped 6%.Therefore, the momentum looks enticing just ahead of the Dec. sessions. Fundamentally, Cirrus focuses on supplying low-power, high-precision mixed-signal processing solutions for mobile and consumer applications including smartphones, tablets, truly wireless headsets, wearables, laptops and augmented reality/virtual reality headsets. The latter could be intriguing for Cirrus because sales for the combined segment could reach over $52 billion by 2027. This compares favorably to the $10.5 billion the sector may hit by the end of this year.For investors, CRUS represents an all-around solid play among tech stocks to buy. Backed by a stable balance sheet, the company offers solid revenue trends and profit margins. Additionally, the company’s undervalued, priced at less than 15 times forward earnings.Sapiens International (SPNS)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockFor those that want to dial up the risk-reward factor in their prospective tech stocks, Sapiens International (NASDAQ:SPNS) may draw intrigue. Based in Israel, SPNS features a market cap of $1.1 billion, right on the cusp of a small and medium-sized enterprise. Since the start of the year, SPNS dropped over 45% in equity value. In the trailing half-year period, it cut this loss down to 18%.Of course, that’s not a positive figure. And in the trailing month, shares are actually down 2.6%. Therefore, you’re taking a heavier risk here. Nevertheless, the fundamentals entice, with Sapiens specializing in computer software for the insurance industry. After the horrors of the coronavirus pandemic, people are much more attuned to insurance products to protect their financial well-being.Financially, investors may point to Sapiens’ three-year revenue growth of 12.8% as an attractive attribute. Also, the company’s undervalued against the price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio, which stands at 0.72 times as opposed to the sector’s median stat of 1.52 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, as technology evolved, starting from the early modern period, it changed the landscape of warfare forever. The British were able to colonize much of the world with ease, despite being few in numbers relative to their subjects, because of advanced military technology. The Defense Industry: An AnalysisIn the present day, technological advantage has replaced the size advantage to a fairly large degree in most military doctrines. These doctrines are executed through investments in military R&amp;D. The global military spending grew by 0.7% in 2021, surpassing the $2 trillion figure. The US alone accounted for 38% of this global spending, with a 2021 military budget of a little over $800 billion. Most of these funds go into defense contract obligations. According to a report released by the US Department of Defense, 71% from the 'contract-obligations-and-payroll-spending' budget went to defense contractors. The report showed that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were the government’s top three defense contractors in 2021, respectively. This goes to show that technology matters much more than military size.There’s many technologies being developed but the ones that have the most to offer in terms of strategic advantages as of late are hypersonic scramjet missiles and glide vehicles, 5G, autonomous systems and AI. The US is already strategically matched by Russia and China in stealth, autonomous systems and air-defense technologies. However, Russia and China have a lead over it in hypersonics. In fact, the top DoD contracts are an effort to develop hypersonic technology. According to a DoD report, hypersonics R&amp;D cost the highest amount of money, at $3.2 billion, in US defense contracts for military technology in 2021. It was followed by autonomous systems &amp; AI, at $2.5 billion and 5G at $1.5 billion. Story continuesMost of the contracts for these novel technologies have been awarded to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Photo by Michael Afonso on UnsplashInsofar as autonomous weapon systems are concerned, even some mid-tier military powers have made significant strides. Turkish Baykar-Bayraktar-TB2 drones supplied to Ukrainian forces have been highly effective in their counter-offensives against Russia. On the other hand, Iranian Shahed-136 drones, which Iran has admitted to exporting to Russia, have been wreaking havoc in Ukrainian cities. When deployed autonomously, these drones can pick and choose their own targets within the mission parameters and so their low cost, autonomy  and group coordination makes them operationally scalable and highly effective.Now that we’re caught up with major global military developments, let’s head over to the list of 12 biggest militaries in the world. Our MethodologyFor our list of the 12 biggest militaries in the world, we’ve ranked them on a 2021-2022 quantitative basis but one that relates primarily to military equipment. We’ve focused on the number of aircraft (in the air force), naval ships (we’ve considered only strategic warships like frigates, cruisers, destroyers and corvettes). We’ve mentioned aircraft carriers and submarines separately for emphasis, tanks and secondarily, personnel (active and reserve).We’ve mentioned the number of strategic assets like nuclear weapons, submarines and aircraft carriers (if any) as well. We’ve also discussed their defense spending. With that said, here’s the 12 biggest militaries in the world: 12. IranStrategic Ballistic Missiles: 3000 Aircraft: 343 Tanks: 1513 Strategic Warships: 10 Submarines: 19Iran is located in West Asia and is the twelfth biggest military power in the world, going by their military arsenal. The country possesses 3,000 strategic missiles with varying range and payload capacity. It tops the range limit at 2,000 kilometers. While Iran currently doesn’t possess nuclear weapons, it has missiles in its arsenal capable of carrying nuclear payload.It has over 1,500 main-battle tanks, 7 frigates, 3 corvettes and 19 submarines. Iran’s aircraft inventory has 343 units in total as of 2021. These include fighters, bombers, multirole, attack aircraft, as well as tankers, transporters, patrol and electronics-warfare aircraft. Its top jets include Sukhoi 27, Mig-29 and F-14 Tomcat. Lastly, the country has close to 1 million personnel that includes both active and reserve military members. Iran is primarily engaged in a cold war in the Middle East against the US and Saudi Arabia, with theaters being Syria and Yemen and to some extent, Iraq.Most of the western military equipment in Iran made by companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is from the pre-Islamic-Revolution era. For instance, the F-14 Tomcat in Iran’s air fleet was made by Grumman Corporation. 11. North KoreaAircraft: 545 Tanks: 3500  Strategic Warships: 11 Submarines: 20 Nuclear Weapons: 50 (estimate figure)North Korea is located in East Asia. It is geopolitically isolated for the most part and has developed a huge military arsenal to counter what it claims are US and South Korean military threats to its sovereignty. It has roughly 3,500 main-battle tanks, 11 strategic warships, which include 3 frigates and 8 corvettes, 545 aircraft, Mig-29 being the premier fighter, and 71 submarines. Its Hwasong-17 missile has a range of over 15,000 kilometers.Its nuclear-weapon estimates, based on the amount of fissile material it possesses, put the number between 45 to 55. It is also one of the biggest militaries in terms of personnel, with its military being 1.9-million-strong as of 2021, including both active and reserve personnel. 10. IsraelAircraft: 334 Tanks: 1370  Strategic Warships: 17 Submarines: 5 Nuclear Weapons: 90 (estimate figure)Israel is a powerful military force in the Middle East. Israel and its neighboring countries have historically had a hostile relationship due to its UN-recognized occupation of Palestine. Its geography, coupled with its lack of strategic depth, makes it enormously vulnerable in the face of a large-scale attack. This has led Israel to develop an aggressive military doctrine based around preemptive measures and technological advantage, and as a result, it has had success in military conflicts against multiple countries. For instance, it was able to defeat the coalition of Jordan, Syria and Egypt in the Six Day War. Israel is perhaps the best example of the fact that size doesn’t matter anymore. Regardless, its military has become sizable over the past 20 or so years. The country spent 2.8% of its 2021 GDP for its military capability. It operates 17 strategic warships, including frigates, corvettes and missile boats, 1,370 tanks and 334 aircraft as of 2022. Its aircraft inventory includes jets like F-16, different variants of F-15 and the fifth generation stealth aircraft F-35 Lightning-II.It has opted for strategic ambiguity on the possession of nuclear weapons but effectively has an estimated 90 nuclear weapons as of 2022. It has close to 0.6 million military personnel, with 73% of it being the reserve personnel. 9. PakistanAircraft: 431 Tanks: 4148 Strategic Warships: 18 Submarines: 8 Nuclear Weapons: 165Pakistan is one of the strongest military powers in Asia. The country has historically had a rocky relationship with neighboring India over Kashmir, leading to three wars. This has led Pakistan to develop a powerful military arsenal. Its military doctrine was based on conventional war with India, but instability in the neighboring Afghanistan and the resulting insurgency in Pakistan’s FATA during War on Terror led the country to develop counter-insurgency capability as well. Pakistan maintains 165 nuclear warheads as of 2021, a vast array of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, nearly 4,200 tanks, 97 attack helicopters, 8 submarines and 18 strategic warships including 10 frigates, 2 destroyers and 6 corvettes. Its aircraft inventory consists of 431 aircraft and spans attack, multirole, bomber and utility airplanes. Its notable fighters include the F-16 Falcon and JF-17 Thunder. Pakistan has 1.2 million military personnel, with more than half being on active duty. 8. FranceAircraft Carriers: 1 Aircraft: 333 Tanks: 222 Strategic Warships: 27 Submarines: 10 Nuclear Weapons: 290 Military Satellites: 7France is one of the two most capable military powers in Europe, the other being the UK. France has invested extensively in its military arsenal under the leadership of Macron, in order to realize 'strategic autonomy' from the US-led NATO. The country maintains an operational aircraft carrier, a total of 290 nuclear warheads, 27 warships including 3 destroyers, 18 frigates and 6 corvettes, 333 aircraft and 67 attack helicopters. France also has 7 operational military satellites. As far as its aircraft fleet goes, Rafale, made by Dassault Aviation Société anonyme (OTCMKTS:DUAVF), is its most prominent multirole fighter, with 102 units in service. France has over 200,000 active military personnel, with 35,000 in reserve. 7. South KoreaAircraft: 595 Tanks: 2321 Strategic Warships: 35 Submarines: 17South Korea borders North Korea and has historically had a tense relationship with its northern counterpart. This is why the country has invested heavily into its military to keep North Korean ambitions in check. In 2021, it dedicated 2.8% of its GDP to defense spending. South Korea boasts an air fleet of 595 aircraft as of 2021. Its notable fighting aircraft include F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon and the fifth generation stealth aircraft F-35 Lightning II. In terms of strategic warships, South Korea’s naval fleet consists of 3 cruisers, 6 destroyers, 14 frigates and 12 corvettes.Its military power on land is primarily bolstered by over 2,000 main-battle tanks. South Korea’s military is manned by 5,50,000 personnel. Its reserve force is one of the biggest in the world, with 2.75 million personnel as of 2020.6. JapanAircraft Carriers: 2 Aircraft: 606 Tanks: 580 Strategic Warships: 44 Submarines: 22Japan’s huge economy, coupled with regional threats, has allowed it to become one of the biggest militaries in the world. The country projects power in the Pacific using two Izumo-class aircraft carriers, with a third one under construction. The aircraft carriers are designed with helicopters in mind but Japan has repurposed them for the fifth generation F-35B Lightning-II Joint Strike Fighters as well. In addition to carriers, Japan’s other strategic ships include 38 destroyers and 6 frigates. Its air fleet has 606 aircraft as of 2022. Notable fighters in Japan’s air force include the F15 Eagle, and the F-2, jointly made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (OTCMKTS:MHVYF). Japan has been building up its forces to counter the rising military vulnerability it faces from China.American defense companies like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) also work with US allies like Japan.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Militaries in the World.   Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks to Buy That Are Too Cheap to Ignore12 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now12 Best ESG Companies in 2022Disclosure: none. 12 Biggest Militaries in the World: Does Size Matter? is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Long-term operations and sustainment affordability has been a B-21 program priority from the start. In partnership with the Air Force, our team has made maintainability an equally important requirement to stealth performance to ensure we’re driving more affordable, predictable operations and sustainment outcomes.9. Global Reach. The B-21 Raider will be the backbone of the U.S. bomber fleet and pivotal to supporting our nation’s strategic deterrence strategy. In addition to its advanced long-range precision strike capabilities that will afford Combatant Commanders the ability to hold any target, anywhere in the world at risk, it has also been designed as the lead component of a larger family of systems that will deliver intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic attack and multi-domain networking capabilities. In a dynamic global security environment, the B-21 will provide the flexibility and deterrence critical to the security of the U.S. and our allies.10. Raider. The B-21 Raider is named in honor of the Doolittle Raid of World War II when 80 airmen, led by Lt. Col. James “Jimmy” Doolittle, and 16 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers set off on a mission that changed the course of World War II. The actions of these 80 volunteers were instrumental in shifting momentum in the Pacific theater. This marked the raid as a catalyst to a multitude of future progress in U.S. air superiority from land or sea. The courageous spirit of the Doolittle Raiders is the inspiration behind the name of the B-21 Raider.Credit: Northrop GrummanCredit: Northrop GrummanContact: Vic Beck 703-280-4456vic.beck@ngc.comA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8794abe2-df41-4cf6-8621-cd493d2fb6a5]"

RTX recently clinched a modification contract involving the Evolved Seasparrow (“ESSM”) Missile Block 2. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. awarded the deal.Details of the DealValued at $397.7 million, this contract includes missile assemblies, shipping containers and spare parts in support of ESSM Block 2 full-rate production requirements. The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States and is scheduled to be completed by March 2027.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Nations are strengthening their defense capabilities amid rising geopolitical tensions. The recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has fueled the demand for military weaponry and arsenals as nations prepare themselves for any sudden assault. In such a scenario, missiles, which play an integral role in any defense structure, may witness a northward trend in demand.Per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.9% over the 2022-2027 period. This bodes well for Raytheon as the company enjoys an established position in manufacturing military missiles.Apart from ESSM, Raytheon enjoys strong demand for a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems. These include the Patriot missile, Standard Missile-6, Standard Missile-3, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more.Consequently, RTX’s backlog for its Missiles &amp; Defense segment came in at $32 billion as of Sep 30, 2022, which signifies an increase from $29 billion as of Dec 31, 2021. Such a strong backlog tends to boost its revenue generation prospects from the Missiles and Defense business unit.Peer GrowthConsidering the aforementioned growth prospects, defense majors who have carved out a position in the military missile market and are poised to enjoy the perks of the expanding market are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC designs and produces missile products, including advanced high-speed propulsion systems, fuses, warheads and controls for air, sea and land-based systems.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 2.9%.

Nike is one of the most recognizable athletic brands in the world, but in recent months, the stock has been under pressure due to inflation, soaring interest rates and supply chain issues.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKENike is in the midst of a tough time, and there's not really anything it can do when the macroeconomic cards are stacked against it. To try and drive further growth, Nike has launched a Web3 platform to bring in more revenue from the metaverse, but this has yet to spark much interest from customers or investors. The company's financial outlook for fiscal 2023 is underwhelming as well. Overall, I think it will take a while for Nike to make a turnaround.Nike's outlook for the next few quarters is underwhelmingNike's management team said it is pleased with the company's first-quarter fiscal 2023 financial results and believes they represent a strong start. The company has gone to great lengths to return profits to shareholders in this tough time through $1.5 billion in dividends and share repurchases.Quarterly revenue of $12.7 billion was up by 4% year over year, lower than inflation but still ekeing out an increase due to its stacked product pipeline, constant innovation and consumer loyalty. However, sales in China decreased by 16% versus the year-ago period due to the country's strict Covid lockdowns.In particular, Nike Direct was responsible for the bulk of the revenue growth as its sales were $5.1 billion. The 14% increase on a reported basis of Nike Direct was attributed to the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy through which the company creates a unique one-on-one consumer experience.Story continuesThe Covid-19 pandemic created a long-term trend towards online shopping, as it caused a shift in consumers' purchase mentality. According to a survey by Prosper Analytics and Insights, 54% of the responses indicated buyers purchased apparel and accessories online, and 26% of people reported purchasing shoes online. Nike Brand Digital has been driving huge growth for the company, which reported a 16% increase in sales thanks to moments of high demand in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.However, a few points in the earnings report had investors worried. The gross profit margin fell by 220 basis points, which led to a 20% decrease in earnings per share. Among other points, Nike has an inventory glut, with the inventory up 44% yearly at $9.7 billion.Furthermore, the sports apparel giant outlined that its gross profit margin is expected to decrease by 350 to 400 basis points compared to the previous year due to excess inventory liquidation, foreign exchange pressure and increased logistics and shipping costs.Macroeconomic headwinds are not helpingNike's investors are unsure how to feel about the company's high inventory. Many possible factors could affect Nike in the future. In August, Nike ended its $15 billion share repurchase program with approximately $5.6 billion worth of shares left behind in order to preserve cash.Due to the inventory glut, Nike has had to liquidate the excess and will still need to offer its products at discounted prices to make profits. Ultimately, this will affect margins and earnings in the coming quarters.Moreover, the ongoing inflation has reduced consumer spending ability as the cost of essential items rises. Investors are rightly worried about consumers spending less on discretionary items, even during the ongoing holiday season, as 43% of consumers feel that they own more things than they require, and 64% do not feel the need to keep up with fashion trends as per EY's Future Consumer Index.Inflation slowed down slightly in October, but it is still considerably higher than most of the past four decades. Under this environment, it does not seem likely that the company's Web3 lauch selling digital goods will have much of a near-term benefit.The launch of Web3 platform is a step in the right directionAs we come closer to calendar 2023, Nike consumers interested in Web3 are getting excited about .Swoosh, Nike's Web3 platform.On the platform, customers will be able to purchase digital apparel and accessories for their metaverse avatars, access one-of-a-kind non-fungible tokens (NFTs), purchase real-world apparel and set up meetings with world-famous athletes.While near-term growth in this segment will likely be lackluster as consumer spending power is being eroded, the long-term outlook seems good, so Nike can get in early. Once the economy is running hot again, consumers will likely spend big bucks on their avatars, virtual events and other digital assets. Swoosh will utilize Polygon, which offers fast speed, minimal fees and compatibility with Ethereum.TakeawayNike is a leading brand in its industry and has a strong digital presence, but the company is facing some headwinds that should not be ignored at the moment. I believe it will take a while for Nike's stock to have a chance of recovering.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$46.98, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's stake.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Wells Fargo insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$105m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

However, around December 2021, the focus shifted more to treatments that patients can take after contracting the disease to prevent severe sickness and hospitalization.Merck &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was the first to apply for emergency use authorization for a Covid pill called molnupiravir under the brand name Lagevrio. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) subsequently applied for approval for a pill-based treatment under brand name Paxlovid.MRK 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MRKPeter Lynch Chart of MRKMerck is one of the largest and oldest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The pharma segment provides drugs in the areas of oncology, hospital acute care, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular and diabetes. The company also has an animal health segment which develops and markets veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines and other health management solutions and services.The company was founded in 1891 and currently has a market capitalization of $275 billion, putting it at all-time highs. However, total revenues could approach $59 billion in 2022, and the company's earnings growth means it is trading roughly in line with historical average valuation levels. Thus, could the stock still be fairly valued?Covid drug operating resultsEarly reports showed the Merck Covid pill cut the risk of hospitalization and death from Covid by 50% in patients who had mild-to-moderate Covid-19 symtoms, but a final analysis of the trial reported in November, before the FDA and EU authorization, showed a reduction in that benefit to 30%.Nonethelesss, molnupiravir became a big seller and is expected to bring in between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion in revenues in 2022. The next year should see a sharp drop-off in molnupiravir sales as more people will have already caught Covid, causing new cases continue to decline. Competition from Pfizers Paxlovid also remains a factor.Story continuesFinancial summaryThe company reports financial operating results both including molnupiravir and excluding the drug. Revenues increased 14% when including the Covid-19 treatment drug and increased 10% without it in its most recent quarterly earnings report. The companys leading anti-cancer drug Keytruda, in comparison, showed a constant-currency sales increase of 26%.Merck reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.28 for the quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.85. The non-GAAP EPS was an increase of 7.0% compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP EPS excludes non-recurring charges, primarily in the areas of merger and acquisition charges and restructuring expenses.The company typically generates very strong levels of free cash flow. For the first nine months of 2022, operating cash flow was $14.7 billion and capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, which created free cash flow of approximately $11.5 billion. During the first period, the company paid down debt in the amount of $2.2 billion and bought back $5.2 billion in common shares.The company maintains a safe balance sheet with $11.1 billion in cash and $30.4 billion in total debt. With $27 billion in Ebitda, the companys debt ratings are strongly investment grade.CEO Robert Davis stated on the recent earnings report:We continue to execute on our strategy, invest in leading-edge science and drive innovation as our colleagues deliver meaningful value for patients which in turn provides value for our shareholders. Our third quarter results demonstrate exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth and sustained performance across our key growth drivers. Inspired by our purpose of saving and improving lives around the world, I am confident we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong operational performance.ValuationThe company recently raised it full-year 2022 guidance and now expects revenue between $58.5 billion and $59.0 billion, which represents approximately 12% growth excluding molnupiravir. Earnings per share guidance was raised slightly to the range of $7.32 to $7.37 (non-GAAP). Analyst consensus calls for 2022 earnings per share of $7.38, which puts Merck's stock price at 14.7 times this year's earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to increase again in 2023 in the $7.55 to $7.60 range according to analysts. The company's enterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratio is approximately 11 based on 2022 Ebitda estimates.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator gives a fair value close to the current stock price when using $7.38 as the starting point, a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.0% and a discount rate of 10%.The company currently pays an annualized dividend of $2.76 which equates to a 2.57% dividend yield. The payout ratio is well below 50% based on current earnings estimates. Merck has been paying dividends for well over 30 years.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased Merck stock or added to their positions recently include Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio) and Private Capital (Trades, Portfolio). Gurus who have reduced their Merck holdings include Dodge &amp; Cox and Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio).Growth drives could disappearMerck stock is trading near all-highs but still maintains reasonable valuation levels. However, most major long-term catalysts have either occurred or are well known to the investor community.For long-term investors, its important to note that the key growth driver for the company, Keytruda, has a patent expiration in 2028. This cliff will be hard to overcome without a major acquisition, and earnings will likely decline at the point.Investors should wait for a lower entry point as the stock will likely not continue to make new all-time highs for any extended period going forward.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on PayPal Holdings'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PayPal Holdings is:11% = US$2.3b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.PayPal Holdings' Earnings Growth And 11% ROEAt first glance, PayPal Holdings seems to have a decent ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 15% does temper our expectations. Although, we can see that PayPal Holdings saw a modest net income growth of 16% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable level of ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between PayPal Holdings' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 15% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is PYPL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PYPL is currently mispriced by the market.Is PayPal Holdings Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?PayPal Holdings doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with PayPal Holdings' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company has seen significant growth in its earnings backed by a respectable ROE and a high reinvestment rate. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +5.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share, indicating a change of +6.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 points to a change of +15% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of +6.2% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7.2%. The $59.32 billion and $59.89 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -16.2% and +1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Waters share price has climbed 70% in five years, easily topping the market return of 44% (ignoring dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Waters There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Waters achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 11%. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Waters' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Waters's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Waters returned a loss of 2.8% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

As customers of the EV maker are frustrated with Tesla's complex repair network, there you see shares of Tesla continuing to fall down more than a percent and GM up one. Yahoo Finance senior autos reporter, Pras Subramanian, here with more on this.Pras, there's long been discussion about the network of dealerships that GM and Ford have. Would that be an advantage or disadvantage? Maybe we're getting a glimpse here.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Not just for GM owners, right? It's an advantage for Tesla owners. So we're seeing that last week at the investor meeting, GM President Mark Reuss said, they had serviced 11,000 Teslas in the last year at GM service center.So this is kind of speaking to a pain point of Tesla ownership, is that there aren't that many service centers to begin with, let alone, and there's not-- and every state doesn't have one.So if you're out of state, you've got to take it somewhere else. And GM supposedly has, within 10 miles of a dealer, has 90% of the US population, within 10 miles of a GM dealer. So it makes a lot of sense.So if you're considering an EV purchase, would you consider a GM product over a Tesla product just based on service alone? Maybe you would. But that's something that GM really wanted to crow about, and they did.JARED BLIKRE: And what are some of the other options that Tesla owners may have, if they own a Tesla and they're looking for servicing, and maybe the head honcho just can't do it at that exact moment?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: [LAUGHS] Well, you know, you don't really have that many options. They have Tesla mobile service where they actually send a person out with a van. They can fix you up there. But that's only in certain situations.Story continuesIn California, you have a lot of third party Tesla EV operators because there's so many EV cars there. But for the most part, if you're in a middle of America state, you really are kind of at the whims of Musk and company and how they're going to service you. Or you go to a GM dealer.DAVE BRIGGS: And this, Pras, is why I'm so bullish on GM and Ford now that they've turned their attention to the EV space. It's going to be interesting to watch--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: A year next year.DAVE BRIGGS: --how Tesla fights back. Yeah. Pras, thank you.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can read 5 Best Falling Stocks to Buy Now.We are approaching the end of the year which has been terrible for the markets. Fears of recession, the Ukraine war, supply chain woes, inventory gluts, and China's Covid lockdowns among other events have hit the markets hard. The Fed has been on the most aggressive rate hike regime since the Volcker days and has raised interest rates by 375 basis points in a single year. The markets have been on a wild ride in 2022. However, now they seem to have priced in most of the factors that have been overwhelming them throughout the year. On November 25, the S&amp;P 500 closed above 4000 points, the Dow closed above 34,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite closed above 11,000 points.""We're Actually Headed Out Of The Woods, But We Are Not Out Of The Woods Yet""On November 25, Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the current market situation and his market outlook for year-end and into 2023. Stoltzfus noted that ""we see a nice rally"" which is led by ""materials, industrials, financials, and utilities"" segments. John Stoltzfus noted that ""investors are coming back"" into the S&amp;P 500, so it supports Oppenheimer's 2022 year-end target for the S&amp;P 500, which is at least 4000 points. Here are some comments from John Stoltzfus:""From where we stand right now, we think the equity market has fairly well priced in a recession earlier on than it's deciding there may not be a recession. The bond market looks like it's sort of caught in between, so we would have to say, with part of it looking like the short end of the curve... We think things are getting better, we're actually headed out of the woods but we are not out of the woods yet...""John Stoltzfus also shared sectors he likes given the current market situation and where he is encouraging investors to look at. John Stoltzfus noted that investors should look into consumer discretionary and technology, and the sectors that he particularly likes include financials and industrials. John Stoltzfus said that he sees materials and energy performing well in 2023. However, he thinks that energy may have peaked and ""energy will not do as well as it did this year (2022), as it is the only sector that is up 60% for the year"". This article will discuss some of the best falling stocks to buy now which include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

These stocks are arranged according to their popularity among elite money managers, from least to most.Best Falling Stocks to Buy Now12. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)Year-To-Date Decline as of November 25: 33.21% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) is a German biotechnology company that is focused on the development of immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. The company was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Mainz, Germany. The company's vaccines have shown promising results in clinical trials and are expected to be approved by regulatory authorities in the near future. The commercial launch of the company's vaccines will drive significant revenue growth and earnings expansion. The company's strong partnerships with leading global pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will enable it to achieve scale and reach a large number of patients globally. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for vaccines against infectious diseases and is ranked among the best falling stocks to buy now. The stock is down 33.21% for the year, as of November 25.On November 10, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced that their booster dose of Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for children of ages 5 to 11. On November 16, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Pfizer Inc.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”Some of the best-in-class companies that are down 30% for the year but are presenting a buying opportunity include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ASTL) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The world is short on raw materials and energy. Nordstern Capital has increased its exposure to raw materials and energy. Recession fears may temporarily suppress demand and prices. The fundamental issue, however, is a sustainable lack of supply, caused by decade-long underinvestment. The shortages cannot be resolved in the short to medium term.Currently suppressed stock prices offer a wonderful opportunity for our commodity businesses to buy back their own shares. For instance, Algoma Steel Group (NASDAQ:ASTL) reduced its diluted share count this year from 177 million to 111 million. Nonetheless, ASTL’s share price has come down 50%, because US HRC steel prices per ton declined in the past year from $2,000 to currently $713. Today, ASTL has $500m in net cash and a market capitalization of about $700m. The company is profitable even in the current recessionary environment. The CFO expects annual mid-cycle free cash flow generation greater than the current ASTL enterprise value. This is one illustrative example. ASTL is not alone. Many present-day commodity businesses are cash and earnings rich and can use weak stock prices for aggressive buybacks.”8.

Now, Akiko, you know something about this, right? I'm a potential EV owner for one day, but you're living this right now.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I have been driving a Tesla for the last month, and it is difficult to get any kind of question answered, getting to service centers. When I'm in-- I'm in California, obviously, where there is a significant network. But let's talk about what GM has said. I mean, 11,000 cars is what they've reportedly repaired so far. We heard that from GM's president Mark Reuss in this investor presentation he gave last week.And Rachelle, you know, this really points to the inherent difference that we have seen in the business models of these companies. You've got the traditional car companies that operate with a network of dealerships that they don't directly own, but that means-- this is according to one set that I saw-- that GM service centers-- Americans are within 10 miles of a service center for GM, as opposed to Tesla where they do directly own the service centers, as well as the sales centers, but that means there's not as many. And in some states, they don't necessarily operate.So this is just anecdotal. I will say that as a car, Tesla has been good so far in the last month for me to drive-- save a lot on gas. But it is frustrating when you can't get to a service center because it's not as accessible.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I bet, and looking at the notes that we heard from the president of GM, he said they're mostly coming to GM for collision repair, routine maintenance, brakes, tires. These are the essentials. And GM has gotten smart to this. And their service centers, they're now adding charging stations as well. So getting a little more into the game here, all thanks to Tesla. Go figure.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, and you have to wonder how much brand loyalty gets built in as a result of that, right? That's kind of what GM is hoping, that you get Tesla drivers in, GM helps them out. Maybe that next car isn't necessarily a Tesla, but a GM.RACHELLE AKUFFO: There you go.]"

Natron's batteries could potentially be deployed in support of a number of uses, including:Charging electric ground equipmentCharging anticipated future electric aircraft such as electric air taxisAllowing airport operations to manage electricity demandGreatly improving resiliency related to inclement weather""Natron's sodium-ion batteries will help the aviation industry achieve its decarbonization and EV goals,"" said Colin Wessells, CEO of Natron Energy. ""Our batteries provide the high power over short distances that ground service equipment needs, and unlike lithium-ion, Natron's batteries are completely nonflammable and can be safely deployed into ground service operations.""Story continuesThe sodium-ion batteries contain several features that distinguish them from existing battery technology. In addition to better output and cycle life than their lithium counterparts, testing performed by an independent testing service has shown these batteries to be nonflammable, a critical safeguard for the high usage and power that would be required for certain operations. The minerals used in sodium-ion batteries are abundant worldwide and are easily sourced, unlike lithium which is in short supply with demand expected to triple by 2025.Natron plans to use the funds to accelerate production at its manufacturing facility in Holland, Michigan, where it will scale operations to begin mass production of UL-listed sodium-ion batteries in 2023.Launched in 2021, UAV is a first-of-its-kind sustainability-focused ventures fund that targets startups, upcoming technologies, and concepts that will complement United's goal of net zero emissions by 2050 – without relying on traditional carbon offsets such as planting trees. UAV's portfolio now includes SAF producers and other technologies including carbon utilization, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft, and urban air mobility.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is United Airlines (UAL). UAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 7.47, which compares to its industry's average of 15.80. Over the past year, UAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 2,764.99 and as low as -3.24, with a median of 18.72.Investors should also recognize that UAL has a P/B ratio of 2.96. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 4.36. Over the past year, UAL's P/B has been as high as 4.68 and as low as 2.01, with a median of 2.99.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. UAL has a P/S ratio of 0.34. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.47.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that UAL has a P/CF ratio of 8.45. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. UAL's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 19.32. Over the past 52 weeks, UAL's P/CF has been as high as 33.67 and as low as -21.15, with a median of 10.53.If you're looking for another solid Transportation - Airline value stock, take a look at Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, B. de C.V (VLRS). VLRS is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, B. de C.V sports a P/B ratio of 5.40 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 4.36. In the past 52 weeks, VLRS's P/B has been as high as 10.67, as low as 3.69, with a median of 5.59.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that United Airlines and Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, B. de C.V are likely undervalued currently.

221,8c421c37-78da-3d34-9a1a-62d45670edff,TGT,2022-11-30,Is Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Trading At A 43% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-nyse-tgt-trading-120027569.html,1669809627,STORY,['TGT'],"[Does the November share price for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Target Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.32bUS$4.48bUS$4.53bUS$5.07bUS$5.93bUS$6.36bUS$6.73bUS$7.05bUS$7.32bUS$7.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.42%Est @ 5.79%Est @ 4.65%Est @ 3.85%Est @ 3.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$2.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$177bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$177b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$96bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$135b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$166, the company appears quite undervalued at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.849. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Target, we've compiled three important factors you should further examine:Risks: For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Target (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does TGT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Russia’s war on Ukraine hindered the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the near-term. The online food delivery market is now expected to reach $159.46 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 5.6%.

Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) was founded in 1984 and is based in Louisville, Kentucky. The company operates and franchises pizza delivery and dine-in restaurants under the Papa John's trademark in the United States and internationally. It operates through four segments – Domestic Company-Owned Restaurants, North America Commissaries, North America Franchising, and International Operations. Story continuesCredit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman on November 4 maintained an Outperform rating on Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $97 from $123. Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) posted a disappointing Q3 print, though its long-term outlook remains resilient, the analyst told investors. Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) remains one of the analyst's favorite names in restaurants, driven by a multi-faceted sales strategy, accelerating unit growth, and margin expansion.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 22 hedge funds were bullish on Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 20 funds in the prior quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.75 million shares worth $193 million. Like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) is one of the best delivery stocks for 2023. Here is what Artisan Small Cap Fund has to say about Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Papa John’s is a global operator and franchisor of pizza delivery and carryout restaurants. The company is tracking nicely against our turnaround thesis which hinges upon an improvement in store-level economics leading to accelerating growth in restaurant development activity. Improved store-level economics is being driven in part by market share gains resulting from menu innovation. New menu items—parmesan crusted Papadias, Epic Stuffed Crust, Shaq-a-roni— coupled with enhancements to the digital/loyalty platform and supportive advertising are attracting new customers to the brand, increasing frequency of its existing customers and driving higher unit volumes and returns. As a result, the company is experiencing incremental interest from new and existing franchisees to develop new restaurants. Papa John’s opened a record 123 units in the first half of 2021 and now expects to open 220-260 new stores this year (vs. 140-180 previously)—most of which are outside of the US. Combined with ample white space globally, we believe a higher unit growth trajectory will drive an attractive and sustainable profit cycle.”10. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a California-based company that operates a peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing in the United States and Canada. Lyft Delivery allows package and food delivery. The company also provides Ridesharing Marketplace, Express Drive, and Lyft Rentals. Argus analyst Jim Kelleher on November 25 maintained a Buy rating on Lyft, Inc.

While the company has made some progress on margins as the economy has re-opened, driver shortages and fuel inflation have disrupted that progress.

(NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Fears of recession, the Ukraine war, supply chain woes, inventory gluts, and China's Covid lockdowns among other events have hit the markets hard. The Fed has been on the most aggressive rate hike regime since the Volcker days and has raised interest rates by 375 basis points in a single year. The markets have been on a wild ride in 2022. However, now they seem to have priced in most of the factors that have been overwhelming them throughout the year.

Stoltzfus noted that ""we see a nice rally"" which is led by ""materials, industrials, financials, and utilities"" segments. John Stoltzfus noted that ""investors are coming back"" into the S&amp;P 500, so it supports Oppenheimer's 2022 year-end target for the S&amp;P 500, which is at least 4000 points. Here are some comments from John Stoltzfus:""From where we stand right now, we think the equity market has fairly well priced in a recession earlier on than it's deciding there may not be a recession. The bond market looks like it's sort of caught in between, so we would have to say, with part of it looking like the short end of the curve... We think things are getting better, we're actually headed out of the woods but we are not out of the woods yet...""John Stoltzfus also shared sectors he likes given the current market situation and where he is encouraging investors to look at. John Stoltzfus noted that investors should look into consumer discretionary and technology, and the sectors that he particularly likes include financials and industrials. John Stoltzfus said that he sees materials and energy performing well in 2023. However, he thinks that energy may have peaked and ""energy will not do as well as it did this year (2022), as it is the only sector that is up 60% for the year"".

The company was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Mainz, Germany. The company's vaccines have shown promising results in clinical trials and are expected to be approved by regulatory authorities in the near future. The commercial launch of the company's vaccines will drive significant revenue growth and earnings expansion. The company's strong partnerships with leading global pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will enable it to achieve scale and reach a large number of patients globally. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for vaccines against infectious diseases and is ranked among the best falling stocks to buy now. The stock is down 33.21% for the year, as of November 25.On November 10, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Pfizer Inc.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”Some of the best-in-class companies that are down 30% for the year but are presenting a buying opportunity include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

Recession fears may temporarily suppress demand and prices. The fundamental issue, however, is a sustainable lack of supply, caused by decade-long underinvestment. The shortages cannot be resolved in the short to medium term.Currently suppressed stock prices offer a wonderful opportunity for our commodity businesses to buy back their own shares. For instance, Algoma Steel Group (NASDAQ:ASTL) reduced its diluted share count this year from 177 million to 111 million. Nonetheless, ASTL’s share price has come down 50%, because US HRC steel prices per ton declined in the past year from $2,000 to currently $713. Today, ASTL has $500m in net cash and a market capitalization of about $700m. The company is profitable even in the current recessionary environment. The CFO expects annual mid-cycle free cash flow generation greater than the current ASTL enterprise value. This is one illustrative example. ASTL is not alone.

If you want to read about some more consumer stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider.Consumer stocks are generally considered one of the safest investments at the stock market because of their predictable business models and relatively lower price volatility as compared to other sectors of the economy. Some examples of consumer industries include food and beverage producers, household item manufacturers, personal care product manufacturers, and tobacco companies. The consumer industry is also highly consolidated in nature, a key driver of demand for the sector in a volatile macro environment. Some of the top firms in this space are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). In the past few months, even as inflation impacts the short-term spending trends, there is a belief among experts that this sentiment might weigh on manufacturing stocks longer than expected. However, the long-term growth indicators for the industry remain overwhelmingly positive, making the sector a top retirement stock portfolio pick.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the consumer sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Consumer Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider11.

Here is what the fund said:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat-footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters (…read more)9. The TJX Companies, Inc.

We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the U.S. and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes.”8.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Lowe’s Companies, Inc.

The company’s strategy to offer more fashion-forward and trendy products in order to attract customers has been a key driver.DDS boasts a robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in third-quarter fiscal 2022. The bottom and top lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and rose year over year. This marked the eighth and ninth straight quarters of top and bottom-line beat, respectively. Results gained from the continued momentum in consumer demand. The company witnessed robust sales in cosmetics, men’s apparel and accessories, home and furniture, and shoes.Backed by the robust earnings trend, the stock has outperformed the industry and the Retail - Wholesale sector in the past year. DDS has rallied 32.3% against the industry’s decline of 10.6% and the sector’s dip of 26.2%. The stock also compares favorably with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 13.4% in the same period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DDS' fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 earnings have moved up 36.6% and 14.2%, respectively, in the past 30 days.

Improved consumer demand and better inventory management have been leading to lower markdowns.However, stiff competition and raw material price inflation are concerning. Also, the company has been witnessing elevated SG&amp;A expenses for the past few quarters, which have been denting the bottom line to some extent. The persistence of the trend might partly affect the company’s profitability.Nonetheless, investors are optimistic about the company’s share repurchases and dividend payments.

MCHP expects revenue growth despite continuing supply chain constraints still impacting the company’s operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.15 billion, representing year-over-year growth of about 22.5%.Microchip is facing severe backlogs. However, its recent growth in revenues can be attributed to the factor that Microchip is addressing certain key megatrends such as AI and ML and its strategic investments in high-growth, high-margin and high-cash-generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. In the last reported second quarter of 2022, net sales of $2.07 billion increased 25.7% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.52%.Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and ConsensusMicrochip Technology Incorporated Price and ConsensusMicrochip Technology Incorporated price-consensus-chart | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteMicrochip Addressing Megatrends for Organic GrowthThe entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to the macro-economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions. This has affected Microchip’s shares along with its peer, Analog Devices ADI.Microchip shares have fallen 14.6% in the year-to-date period (YTD) compared with the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry’s decline of 14.5%.ADI shares are down 6.7% in the YTD period even though it continues to enjoy solid demand for high-performance analog and mixed-signal solutions, which consistently impacted its revenue growth positively. Overall negative sentiment in the market made investors bearish on the stock.However, Microchip, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is one of the semiconductor sector companies, which is looking to benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act. This act supports investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduces dependence on foreign markets like China. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesMCHP’s peer, onsemi ON is already benefiting from the recent declaration of the act by the government.onsemi shares have inched up 3% in the YTD period, reflecting positive impacts from the newly-signed act and bullish investor sentiments as it provides returns in double digits in high-growth industries like automotive.The recently signed act by the Biden organization will see a boost of $52 billion in the U.S. chip industry and reduce its dependency on outside sources like China for manufacturing.This will help to reduce certain supply chain constraints faced globally and cut back on severe backlogs faced by the company and address high-margin key megatrends like AI and ML.Per Microchip, due to the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, the total port bandwidth for 400G (gigabits per second) and 800G is forecasted to grow at more than 50% annually. As a result, demand for 112G PAM4 connectivity is increasing beyond the cloud data center and telecom services to enterprise ethernet switching platforms.To meet the demand for better connectivity to address key megatrends such as AI and ML, which are at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution, Microchip is expanding its Ethernet PHY with the launch of its latest META-DX2+ Ethernet PHYs.However, as MCHP is looking to diversify its portfolio to address the growing need for increased bandwidth, other tech companies like Broadcom AVGO are also jumping at the opportunity.Broadcom also recently announced that it is launching its new Trident 4C Ethernet switch ASIC to address the growing security issues with increasing network bandwidth. Broadcom has been expanding its switch series for a while to address one of the most prevalent issues in the market currently, to accurately and securely handle growing network bandwidth.To diversify income from its microcontroller business riddled with supply-chain disturbances, Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221129005180/en/Regions Bank on Tuesday announced the results of a new medical financial hardship survey that finds people are not financially prepared to cover medical expenses or pay off medical debt, despite perhaps thinking they are prepared. (Graphic: Business Wire)The survey was conducted by Regions Next Step, the bank’s no-cost financial education program that serves people of all ages, regardless of whether they bank with Regions. According to the survey, six in 10 (59%) people are confident they could cover regular and expected medical costs like co-pays and deductibles. Nearly the same number (56%) feel similarly about unexpected medical costs like out-of-network charges and prescriptions.Despite this, the survey finds many people are not able to cover medical bills when they are due. Two in five people have experienced an unexpected medical event in the last year and, among those, seven in 10 found it difficult to pay for it. Younger respondents were among the most likely to have trouble paying.Additionally, more than one in three people (35%) have medical debt, and an overwhelming majority (82%) are struggling to resolve it. Among those with medical debt, seven in 10 respondents had debt that is either overdue or in collections. Women and those with household incomes lower than $100,000 were most likely to carry this debt, according to the survey.Further, medical expenses and debt are taking a toll on peoples’ savings. Due to the cost of medical bills in the last year, nearly one-quarter of Americans has either used all their savings to cover the expenses or has been contacted by a collection agency due to medical bills.Story continuesResults also show there are knowledge gaps when it comes to options for tackling medical debt. Approximately half of respondents (54%) do not know how to obtain debt relief for medical bills, use a health savings account or flexible spending account to cover costs (49%) or negotiate a medical bill (48%).""Medical events can be traumatic and unpredictable – and the resulting debt can add greater stress to the healing process. Being prepared beforehand and knowing how to address medical debt can make a significant difference to staying on track with your finances,"" said Joye Hehn, Next Step financial education manager for Regions Bank. ""Regions is committed to providing resources and information that can help families manage health care-related expenses and keep their financial goals within reach during a medical hardship.""Additional key findings of the survey include:One in three Americans has delayed going to the doctor or scheduling a procedure because of money concerns related to an unexpected medical event. Another one in five has skipped a recommended medical test or treatment altogether.For those with medical debt, 75% said daily expenses, such as food, clothing and transportation, were the greatest barriers to repayment. Other barriers included:Housing payments (53%)The financial impact of the pandemic (42%)When asked how they would cover an emergency medical expense around $1,000, 20% said emergency savings. Another 21% said credit card, and another 19% said cash.Regions Bank is highlighting free resources that are available year-round to help people prepare and stay in control of their finances when medical costs arise. This includes a series of medical financial hardship courses available in the expanded Next Step library of resources. These courses provide tips for negotiating medical bills, preventing bankruptcy, managing out-of-pocket health care costs and obtaining debt relief.""During the pandemic, many Americans found themselves without work or insurance coverage, putting a strain on their ability to pay off old medical debt or manage new expenses. Even as the pandemic eases, many still struggle with this debt,"" said Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for Regions Bank. ""At Regions, our commitment is to provide resources and financial education people need to successfully manage whatever comes their way. I’m proud of the work the team at Regions has done to raise awareness and provide valuable resources to address this critical issue impacting our communities.""Regions Next Step also recommends the following tips:Negotiate expenses with medical providers. When expenses are not covered by insurance, negotiate with the health care provider for a lower fee or longer payment timeframe. Providers may settle the debt for less than the amount owed if a lump-sum payment if made. Alternatively, providers may set up an interest-free payment plan. Learn more tips about medical payments in this article.Look for ways to keep medical costs down. Thoroughly review medical bills for errors or overcharges before paying because finding and disputing errors can potentially save money. Additionally, prices can vary across providers and insurers, so shop around for the best rates and options. Some employers offer a Flexible Savings Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA), so consider enrolling in this benefit. Both types of accounts allow people with health insurance to set aside money to help cover ""qualified medical expenses,"" which may include deductibles, copays and prescription costs. Learn more about these strategies and other tips for managing out-of-pocket healthcare costs by taking this Next Step Course.Build or maintain an emergency savings fund. Build an emergency savings fund with a goal of six months of living expenses to help offset a medical emergency expense. Calculate how much you need to save to reach it and start setting aside that money each month or paycheck. Once funds are used, be sure to replenish it. Check out this article for more tips on building your emergency savings.Create a debt payment plan. Getting debt under control takes planning and discipline. Start by determining how much is owed and create an accurate, realistic budget. Decide how much income can be put toward debt each month and commit to making those payments. Try to pay more than the minimum payment each month, and pay on time to avoid late fees. Use this Regions calculator to create a debt payoff plan.Explore debt relief options.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Visa share price has climbed 93% in five years, easily topping the market return of 44% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 8.7% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Visa To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Visa achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 14% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Visa will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Visa, it has a TSR of 99% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Visa has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 8.7% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 15% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute.

If you want to see more best ESG stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now.ESG investing is one of the biggest trends in all of Wall Street.ESG stands for environmental, social and governance and ESG investing is also known as socially responsible investing.Today, the world faces a number of issues that are rapidly eroding the sustainability of our way of life. The world is getting warmer due to greenhouse emissions. We are rapidly exhausting our supply of fresh water in many areas. Our social and governance systems can also be improved.With ESG investing, investors invest in companies that do well in terms of trying to make their operations more environmentally friendly, trying to help their communities, and trying to have good corporate governance.As a result of more awareness over the issues facing our world, many investors and institutions have dedicated more resources to ESG investing.According to PwC, asset managements are expected to increase their ESG-related AUM to $33.9 trillion globally by 2026, up from $18.4 trillion in 2021. If successful, ESG assets could constitute over one fifth of the total global assets under management by 2026.In terms of PwC's base case growth scenario, ESG AUM in the United States could rise to $10.5 trillion in 2026 from $4.5 trillion in 2021. In Europe, ESG AUM could increase to $19.6 trillion in 2026. Finally, ESG AUM in the Asia Pacific region could rise to $3.3 trillion.PwC Global Asset &amp; Wealth Management Leader, PwC Ireland Olwyn Alexander said, “ESG has become perhaps the most powerful driver of growth in asset and wealth management. The surge in demand for ESG investments highlighted in our survey exceeds almost all previous expectations.""2022 has been a challenging year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times this year alone. As a result of the interest rate increases, many economists think there could be a recession next year. According to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, the U.S. central bank will likely need interest rates above 5% for most of next year and into 2024 to win the battle against inflation. Currently the upper bound for the Federal funds rate is 4%.Story continuesAs a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Hadrian / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor the best 12 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now list, we took the top 12 unique stocks by weight from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) and we ranked them based on percent of funds as of 11/28/2022.

Markets are also awaiting key U.S. payrolls data later in the week.While the minutes of the Fed’s November meeting showed that a growing number of Fed members support smaller rate hikes in the coming months, Fed speakers have warned that stubborn inflation will likely keep U.S. rates elevated until well into 2024.This did little to curb a month-long rally in metal markets, as the prospect of a smaller rate hike in December offered much relief to non-yielding assets such as gold.Spot gold prices steadied around $1,748.99 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,747.30 an ounce. Both instruments jumped nearly 1% on Tuesday, and were set to rise around 7% for November- their strongest monthly gain since May 2021.But the outlook for gold still remains muted, given that U.S. inflation is trending well above the Fed’s annual target. Stubborn inflation could see the central bank tighten monetary policy further to bring down prices- a scenario that is negative for gold.The yellow metal fell sharply this year as rising interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell slightly on Wednesday, but were also set for their best month in 2022.Copper futures fell 0.1% to $3.6405 a pound, after rising 0.7% in the prior session. But they were set to rise nearly 8% in November- their best month since early-2021.Copper prices were largely boosted by speculation over the scaling back of COVID-related restrictions in major importer China.Story continuesThe world’s largest copper importer is facing increased public ire over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has driven speculation that the government will be forced to suspend restrictive measures.But Beijing has given no such indication so far, as the country grapples with a record-high daily increase in COVID-19 infections. This saw the reintroduction of strict movement curbs in several major cities over the past two months, which weighed heavily on China's economy.Related ArticlesGold, copper set for best month in 2022 on dovish Fed, China hopesU.S. senators introduce bill to expand E15 gasoline sales, with support from oil groupOil extends rebound on hopes of China reopening, OPEC cut speculation]"

Instead, with the housing market beginning a gradual adjustment that could last through 2025, what next year will offer buyers is less competition for a growing number of for-sale homes.Homebuying Costs Aren't Coming Down in 2023Overall in 2023,1 Realtor.com® forecasts that buyers and sellers can expect:Average mortgage rates of 7.4%, with early 2023 hikes followed by a slight retreat to 7.1% by year-end.Home sales prices won't come down, but growth will moderate to a single-digit yearly pace (+5.4%) for the first time since 2020.Rents (+6.3% year-over-year) will outpace home prices and likely hit new highs, further adding to budget pressures – especially for first-time buyers.An increase in existing homes for sale (+22.8% year-over-year), as the inventory refresh that began last summer accelerates.Home sales will decline 14.1% year-over-year to 4.53 million, the lowest level since 2012 (see table below).""Compared to the wild ride of the past two years, 2023 will be a slower-paced housing market, which means drastic shifts like price declines may not happen as quickly as some have anticipated. It will be a challenging year for both buyers and sellers, but an important one in setting the stage for home sales to return to a sustainable pace over the next two to three years,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""With mortgage rates continuing to climb as the Fed navigates the economy to a soft-ish landing, higher costs will lead to fewer closings, but that doesn't mean homebuying will stop entirely in 2023. Americans who are determined to make a move will find that staying up-to-date on the market, flexibility, creativity and a healthy dose of patience will go a long way toward success in the year ahead.""Story continuesKey 2023 housing trends and wildcards A second wind in the second half. Although home sales are expected to slow overall in 2023, Realtor.com®'s forecast points to the possibility of a second wind in buying activity in the second half of the year. With mortgage rate hikes projected to continue through March, the Spring season will likely be less busy than in a typical year as buyers and sellers recalibrate their expectations around smaller budgets. This break could provide space for demand to renew as mortgage rates dip later in the year, when home shoppers will also have more options and bargaining power.A trifecta of budget barriers awaits buyers. In 2023, incomes are expected to grow (+3.9%), but not enough to offset higher mortgage rates (7.4%) and home prices (+5.4%), creating a trifecta of budget barriers. The typical monthly mortgage payment will be $2,430, 28% higher than in 2022, which will likely price many home shoppers out of the market. This will especially be a concern for first-time buyers. As rents will likely reach new highs, it will leave less room for saving towards a down payment. At the same time, some home shoppers may consider exploring new financial options like adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), a trend that has already begun to take shape in 2022.It isn't '08. During the mid-2000s housing boom, home sales were elevated for more than five years, and it took another five years for home sales to recover from the economic aftermath. Comparatively, mortgage rate hikes have brought a quicker but less dramatic end to the recent frenzy, during which buyers have been better qualified than in '08. Moving forward, home price growth will slow and may even decline periodically as prices largely stabilize over the next two-to-three years. The homeownership rate is predicted to hold in 2023.Some homeowners could still make bank. In 2023, the typical homeowner is projected to gain $25,650 in equity as prices keep rising. With real estate wealth already much higher than pre-COVID, these trends offer a positive reality check for sellers who have been increasingly pessimistic about entering the market as listing prices have pulled back from last year's peak. While bidding wars won't be the norm in 2023, sellers who have owned their home for a longer period of time are still likely to make a profit. And those living in relatively affordable areas may still command offers above asking, driven by continued home shopper interest in relocating to lower-priced markets.2023 puts the ""wild"" in wildcards: Political and economic events can always shake up the housing outlook, as was the case with major financial shifts in 2022. Along with factors including supply chain disruptions and the conflict in Ukraine, markets have largely begun to adjust for these changes, such as with the Fed's efforts to combat inflation with rate hikes. As such, forecasted 2023 housing trends don't anticipate a major shakeup like a recession, but it's still a possibility. Buyers and sellers should keep an eye out for risk signs like a substantial weakening in the jobs market, beyond the mild uptick in unemployment that is projected, as businesses are potentially disrupted by shifting geopolitical, financial and economic conditions. Although a potential recession may lead to lower mortgage rates, ultimately buyers' purchasing power would suffer. And for sellers, this would likely mean less demand and potential price drops.""Of the many factors that are expected to affect the housing market in 2023, affordability tops the list of issues most likely to make or break buyers' plans. Still, our forecast does offer promise for home shoppers who are well-prepared.

Without government support, that could drop to 36% by the end of this decade, according to the analysis released by U.S. industry body Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting Group.The United States has already lost its lead in chip manufacturing, prompting the Biden administration to pass the CHIPS and Science Act this year. An earlier report by SIA and BCG in 2020 showed the U.S. share of modern global chip manufacturing capacity had fallen to 12% by that year, down from 37% in 1990.While companies like Intel Corp both design and manufacture chips, so-called fabless chipmakers like Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc design chips that are made by the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co..The report also said government support is helping companies in countries like China and South Korea to gain market share in chip designing as well.It said federal investment in semiconductor design and R&amp;D of $20 billion-$30 billion through 2030, including a $15 billion-$20 billion investment tax credit for chip design, would be needed to maintain U.S. leadership in the long-run.While the CHIPS and Science Act included $39 billion in manufacturing grants for chip production and $13 billion for R&amp;D, nothing was tagged for chip designing specifically, according to a spokesperson for SIA.The report also said the U.S. chip industry will face a shortage of 23,000 design workers by 2030, but funding from the federal government could help support training up a workforce.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can read 5 Best Falling Stocks to Buy Now.We are approaching the end of the year which has been terrible for the markets. Fears of recession, the Ukraine war, supply chain woes, inventory gluts, and China's Covid lockdowns among other events have hit the markets hard. The Fed has been on the most aggressive rate hike regime since the Volcker days and has raised interest rates by 375 basis points in a single year. The markets have been on a wild ride in 2022. However, now they seem to have priced in most of the factors that have been overwhelming them throughout the year. On November 25, the S&amp;P 500 closed above 4000 points, the Dow closed above 34,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite closed above 11,000 points.""We're Actually Headed Out Of The Woods, But We Are Not Out Of The Woods Yet""On November 25, Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the current market situation and his market outlook for year-end and into 2023. Stoltzfus noted that ""we see a nice rally"" which is led by ""materials, industrials, financials, and utilities"" segments. John Stoltzfus noted that ""investors are coming back"" into the S&amp;P 500, so it supports Oppenheimer's 2022 year-end target for the S&amp;P 500, which is at least 4000 points. Here are some comments from John Stoltzfus:""From where we stand right now, we think the equity market has fairly well priced in a recession earlier on than it's deciding there may not be a recession. The bond market looks like it's sort of caught in between, so we would have to say, with part of it looking like the short end of the curve... We think things are getting better, we're actually headed out of the woods but we are not out of the woods yet...""John Stoltzfus also shared sectors he likes given the current market situation and where he is encouraging investors to look at. John Stoltzfus noted that investors should look into consumer discretionary and technology, and the sectors that he particularly likes include financials and industrials. John Stoltzfus said that he sees materials and energy performing well in 2023. However, he thinks that energy may have peaked and ""energy will not do as well as it did this year (2022), as it is the only sector that is up 60% for the year"".

BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)Year-To-Date Decline as of November 25: 33.21% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) is a German biotechnology company that is focused on the development of immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. The company was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Mainz, Germany. The company's vaccines have shown promising results in clinical trials and are expected to be approved by regulatory authorities in the near future. The commercial launch of the company's vaccines will drive significant revenue growth and earnings expansion. The company's strong partnerships with leading global pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will enable it to achieve scale and reach a large number of patients globally. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for vaccines against infectious diseases and is ranked among the best falling stocks to buy now. The stock is down 33.21% for the year, as of November 25.On November 10, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced that their booster dose of Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for children of ages 5 to 11.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”Some of the best-in-class companies that are down 30% for the year but are presenting a buying opportunity include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

Recession fears may temporarily suppress demand and prices. The fundamental issue, however, is a sustainable lack of supply, caused by decade-long underinvestment. The shortages cannot be resolved in the short to medium term.Currently suppressed stock prices offer a wonderful opportunity for our commodity businesses to buy back their own shares. For instance, Algoma Steel Group (NASDAQ:ASTL) reduced its diluted share count this year from 177 million to 111 million. Nonetheless, ASTL’s share price has come down 50%, because US HRC steel prices per ton declined in the past year from $2,000 to currently $713. Today, ASTL has $500m in net cash and a market capitalization of about $700m. The company is profitable even in the current recessionary environment. The CFO expects annual mid-cycle free cash flow generation greater than the current ASTL enterprise value. This is one illustrative example. ASTL is not alone. Many present-day commodity businesses are cash and earnings rich and can use weak stock prices for aggressive buybacks.”8.

The world is getting warmer due to greenhouse emissions. We are rapidly exhausting our supply of fresh water in many areas. Our social and governance systems can also be improved.With ESG investing, investors invest in companies that do well in terms of trying to make their operations more environmentally friendly, trying to help their communities, and trying to have good corporate governance.As a result of more awareness over the issues facing our world, many investors and institutions have dedicated more resources to ESG investing.According to PwC, asset managements are expected to increase their ESG-related AUM to $33.9 trillion globally by 2026, up from $18.4 trillion in 2021. If successful, ESG assets could constitute over one fifth of the total global assets under management by 2026.In terms of PwC's base case growth scenario, ESG AUM in the United States could rise to $10.5 trillion in 2026 from $4.5 trillion in 2021.

Finally, ESG AUM in the Asia Pacific region could rise to $3.3 trillion.PwC Global Asset &amp; Wealth Management Leader, PwC Ireland Olwyn Alexander said, “ESG has become perhaps the most powerful driver of growth in asset and wealth management. The surge in demand for ESG investments highlighted in our survey exceeds almost all previous expectations.""2022 has been a challenging year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times this year alone. As a result of the interest rate increases, many economists think there could be a recession next year.

But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term McKesson Europe AG (HMSE:CLS1) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 22% over a half decade.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for McKesson Europe To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, McKesson Europe moved from a loss to profitability. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.It could be that the revenue decline of 17% per year is viewed as evidence that McKesson Europe is shrinking. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthBalance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of McKesson Europe, it has a TSR of -7.1% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that McKesson Europe shares lost 9.1% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 14%. Given the total loss of 1.4% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. Whilst Baron Rothschild does tell the investor ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", buyers would need to examine the data carefully to be comfortable that the business itself is sound. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  McKesson Europe is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

255,1b3076fa-65fa-39bf-8fd8-aad627eb5e95,MCK,2022-11-30,McKesson (MCK) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mckesson-mck-incredible-growth-stock-174505409.html,1669743905,STORY,['MCK'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends McKesson (MCK) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this prescription drug distributor is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for McKesson is 16.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 4.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 1%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, McKesson has an S/TA ratio of 4.31, which means that the company gets $4.31 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.76, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And McKesson is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 4% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for McKesson. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.4% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made McKesson a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions McKesson well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

256,90d0bb76-e1b3-386a-baf8-b578a460db13,MCK,2022-11-30,Here's Why You Should Hold OPKO Health (OPK) Stock For Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-opko-health-154703809.html,1669736823,STORY,"['OPK', 'AMN', 'MCK']","[OPKO Health, Inc. OPK is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its potential in RAYALDEE. Better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 revenues, along with a few strategic agreements, are expected to contribute further. Stiff competition and concerns regarding overdependence on RAYALDEE persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 70.9% compared with a 27.7% decline of the industry and a 16.7% fall of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned multinational biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company has a market capitalization of $1.14 billion. Its earnings are projected to grow 27.9% in 2023. The company is expected to maintain its strong performance. OPKO Health’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in three, with the average earnings surprise being 94.17%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.RAYALDEE’s Potential: We are upbeat about OPKO Health’s RAYALDEE business. Within the Pharmaceuticals arm, revenues from products fell 12.2% to $32.4 million, primarily due to forex headwinds in OPKO Health’s Chilean and European operations and lower sales of RAYALDEE. Although RAYALDEE sales declined during the third quarter, the drug has shown a promising growth trend in the first half of 2022. The drug has been developed for treating adult chronic kidney disease patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The secondary hyperparathyroidism market is likely to see a CAGR of 9% over the next five years, per a report by Fortune Business Insights.In February, OPKO Health announced that Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma had initiated the commercial launch of RAYALDEE (extended-release calcifediol) in Germany, its first launch outside the United States.Strategic Agreements: OPKO Health has entered into a slew of agreements over the past few months, raising our optimism. During the second quarter of 2022, management confirmed that BioReference Laboratories’ Scarlet Health announced a collaboration with Teladoc Health.Story continuesIn May, it announced the acquisition of a privately held biotechnology company, ModeX Therapeutics, Inc. The acquisition expands the OPKO Health’s immunotherapy pipeline. These developments raise our optimism about OPKO Health. The company’s continued strength in its women's health and oncology businesses also augurs well.Promising Q3 Results: OPKO Health exited the third quarter with better-than-expected revenues. The continued launch of OPKO Health’s NGENLA (somatrogon) by Pfizer Inc. in Japan, Germany and other global markets looks promising. Pfizer is currently seeking pricing approvals in additional European countries and continues to work with the FDA to obtain approval in the United States.DownsidesStiff Competition:The pharmaceutical, diagnostic and laboratory testing industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing and extensive search for technological innovation. Numerous companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products competitive with those of OPKO Health. The company intends to commercialize itself and through its partners.Overdependence on RAYALDEE: OPKO Health’s RAYALDEE is the company’s only pharmaceutical product approved for marketing in the United States. The company’s ability to generate revenues from product sales and achieve profitability is substantially dependent on its ability to effectively commercialize RAYALDEE. The failure to successfully commercialize RAYALDEE would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Estimate TrendOPKO Health is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has widened from a loss of 38 cents per share to a loss of 43 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $172.79 million, suggesting a 56.9% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.OPKO Health, Inc.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Air Products and Chemicals, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 10%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the Chemicals industry. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Air Products and Chemicals compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 10% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 48% in that time. Since 10% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayThe main thing to remember is that Air Products and Chemicals has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 110% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.If you want to continue researching Air Products and Chemicals, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

All told, Disney paid $3.8 billion to acquire BAMTech, now known as Disney Streaming.In 2016, Disney made a $1 billion investment in BAMTech, giving it a 33% stake, and then a year later paid an additional $1.58 billion for a 75% stake. In August 2021, the NHL opted to sell its 10% interest in BAMTech to Disney for $350 million. As of Oct. 1, 2022, MLB’s 15% interest in BAMTech was recorded in Disney’s financial statements at $828 million.MLB created the precursor to BAMTech in 2000 with MLB Advanced Media. In 2002, the league began streaming live video online with its MLB.TV service — years before YouTube was a glimmer in Google’s eye. In 2015, Major League Baseball spun off the streaming-technology division as BAMTech, setting up the eventual takeover by Disney.Disney’s full ownership of BAMTech comes amid the company’s surprise Nov. 20 announcement that Bob Iger would return as CEO, with the board ousting former chief exec Bob Chapek after less than three years. Iger has a mandate from Disney’s board “to set the strategic direction for renewed growth.”At a company-wide meeting Monday, Iger told employees that Disney’s streaming businesses should aim to achieve profits instead of trying to maximize subscriber growth.In a memo to Disney staffers on Nov. 21, Iger said restructuring at the company will begin “in the coming weeks.” As part of that restructuring, Kareem Daniel, chairman of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, will leave the company.In Disney’s 10-K filing Tuesday with the SEC, the company said “we anticipate that within the coming months Mr. Iger will initiate organizational and operating changes within the company to address the board’s goals.”Story continues“While the plans are in early stages, changes in our structure and operations, including within DMED (and including possibly our distribution approach and the businesses/distribution platforms selected for the initial distribution of content), can be expected. The restructuring and change in business strategy, once determined, could result in impairment charges,” Disney said in the filing.Meanwhile, Disney continues to own 67% of Hulu with the remaining 33% held by NBCUniversal (which as of Oct. 1, 2022, was recorded by Disney as valued at $8.7 billion). Under the companies’ 2019 agreement, beginning in January 2024, NBCU has the option to require Disney to buy out NBCU’s interest in Hulu while conversely Disney has the option to require NBCU to sell the 33% stake in Hulu. In either scenario, the buyout price will be based on Hulu’s “equity fair value” at the time with a guaranteed minimum value of $27.5 billion (meaning NBCU’s ownership stake is worth at least $9.2 billion).Chapek had been angling to reach a deal with NBCU owner Comcast to acquire full ownership of Hulu sooner than the January 2024 cutoff date (while Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has said he’d be interested in buying out Disney’s majority share). Under Iger, it’s not clear at this point how Disney plans to proceed.Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in December 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in December 2022Matthew Perry Gets Real About His Addiction Journey In Vulnerable New Memoir 'Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing']"

It aims to invest in more lucrative projects in the Americas.ExxonMobil reduced crude production in West Africa to less than 15,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) through the existing Serpentina floating production unit. Europe is the primary recipient of Equatorial Guinea’s oil exports.ExxonMobil’s crude production in Equatorial Guinea peaked at more than 300,000 bpd eight years ago. Production has been declining since then. Last year, the company’s production in West Africa totaled 93,000 bpd, with about 45,000 bpd extracted in Equatorial Guinea.Per OPEC estimates, production in the Americas will increase to 28 million bpd next year as a result of declining crude production in West Africa. A significant portion of the escalation comes from the United States, Canada, Guyana and Brazil, wherein ExxonMobil increased spending on the production of crude oil.ExxonMobil plans to decommission Zafiro and move the platform away, likely next month. The company has been attempting to divest its Zafiro operation since 2020. XOM could recover some of Zafiro’s production and reach 25,000-30,000 bpd by adding a third platform, Jade.Although crude production is sinking, West Africa’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) outlook is growing and hydrocarbon production could increase elsewhere in Africa. Big producers are investing in gas and LNG as Europe looks to replace supplies after sanctions were imposed on Russia.Rising demand globally could lead to a 30% increase in gas production in Africa by the end of this decade. Libya and Algeria produce crude at lower costs and could attract investments when taken proper measures to reduce emissions from operations. Favorable oil and gas reserves have been found in Namibia, with appraisal wells expected to be drilled in the first half of 2023.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of ExxonMobil have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Colgate-Palmolive's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive peKeen to find out how analysts think Colgate-Palmolive's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Colgate-Palmolive's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 27%. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 15% overall. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 17% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.1% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Colgate-Palmolive is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From Colgate-Palmolive's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Colgate-Palmolive maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive   you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Through managed automated network provisioning and monitoring, Apstra has already delivered Indonet an estimated 20% in cost-savings efficiency.As the world’s largest archipelago, Indonesia has established a reputation as a preferred data center location in Southeast Asia due to its strategic location across vital shipping lanes, high levels of internet penetration and vibrant digital-first economy. To capitalize on this, the government has rolled out ambitious initiatives to accelerate economic growth, fueled by the urgency for digital transformation across industry sectors like manufacturing, finance and healthcare.With digital transformation underway, the demand for reliable and scalable colocation services has spiked – with spending in the capital, Jakarta, alone expected to reach $938M by 2027 at a projected five-year CAGR of 22.7%. As Indonesia’s first Internet Service Provider, Indonet has built a reputation for providing scalable and reliable digital infrastructure solutions and is poised to capture more of that ongoing growth.Indonet utilized Apstra to validate the design, deployment and operation of the EVPN/VXLAN overlay and IP fabric underlay of its latest data center, both built on Juniper QFX Series Switches. The use of validated templates and zero-touch provisioning has resulted in reduced deployment times and reliable data center operations, allowing Indonet to significantly streamline the day-to-day management of its data center networks and unify them in a virtual environment seamlessly.Story continuesAs the only solution in the industry supporting a multivendor environment, Apstra can manage data centers built with different vendors, simplifying Indonet’s network operations while accelerating its scalability. Not only has Apstra dramatically reduced tedious manual tasks with repeatable blueprints, but it has also freed up skilled engineers at the company for more strategic work.Additionally, the latest networking upgrades supported by Juniper’s Professional Services and Advanced Services empower Indonet to better respond to customer needs with greater agility, providing ultra-low latency and highly reliable cloud solutions required to power the country’s enterprises – the backbone of Indonesia’s economic growth.Supporting Quotes:""Our vision is to become the digital infrastructure enabler of choice in Indonesia.

If you want to read about some more energy stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Energy Stocks to Consider.The energy sector has been one of the best performers in the S&amp;P 500 over the past few decades despite the volatility seen in energy prices in recent years. In the last few months, the energy sector, amid a slowing macro environment, has outperformed the broader market as investors shift away from riskier sectors like tech towards safer havens in energy. Some of the top energy stocks in this context include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).The energy industry is expected to continue on a growth path in the coming years as innovations within the sector, with the rise of renewables and alternative sources, as well as government spending stimulate business. This makes the industry a top investment pick for a retirement stock portfolio. Per estimates by S&amp;P Global, US spending on upgrading and modernizing energy and water infrastructure will reach $63 billion in 2022. Investors who are eager to capitalize on these growth trends should invest in energy stocks for maximum reward. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the energy sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. Many of these stocks are solid dividend payers, which make them ideal for a retirement portfolio.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Energy Stocks to ConsiderRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Energy Stocks to Consider11. Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19   Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) owns a portfolio of renewable power generating facilities primarily in North America, Colombia, Brazil, Europe, India, and China. It is one of the best safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 11, Brookfield Business Partners, with its institutional partners, agreed to sell Westinghouse Electric Co, which is its nuclear technology services operation, to an investor group led by Cameco and Brookfield Renewable Partners for $8 billion.  Story continuesOn October 18, TD Securities analyst Sean Steuart resumed coverage of Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) stock with a Buy rating and $41 price target, highlighting that the partnership with Cameco to acquire Westinghouse Electric expands the firm more aggressively into broader energy transition segments.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 19 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $161 million in Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP), compared to 19 in the preceding quarter worth $236 million. Just like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) is one of the best safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) is a pure-play renewables operator and developer headquartered in Canada, focused on international hydro, solar, wind and storage technology. As more private and public institutions announce ambitious carbon reduction initiatives, Brookfield Renewable’s globally diversified, multi-technology renewables business makes it an attractive partner. Brookfield’s development pipeline stands at 18,000 MWs, providing confidence that the company can meet its targeted double-digit cash flow growth through 2025. The market narrative around the energy transition and energy security, along with increasing fossil fuels prices which have driven greater focus on switching to renewables, helped Brookfield shares in the quarter.”10. Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32  Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) delivers end-to-end clean hydrogen and zero-emissions fuel cell solutions for various sectors. It is one of the top safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On September 8, Plug Power said that it has secured its largest multi-site electrolyzer order in Europe. Lhyfe, a hydrogen production company, listed at Euronext in Paris, placed an order for ten 5MW PEM electrolyzer systems for production of green hydrogen across multiple plants in Europe.On October 21, Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas assumed coverage of Plug Power Inc.

(NASDAQ:PLUG), compared to 26 in the preceding quarter worth $258.9 million. 9. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44    SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

It is one of the premier safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 28, SolarEdge announced the Australian launch of a DC optimized smart energy ecosystem that promises to get the most from solar and battery systems, both on energy cost savings and energy security.On October 25, B. Riley analyst Christopher Souther maintained a Buy rating on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) stock and lowered the price target to $377 from $385, noting the reduced gross margin estimates for fourth quarter and early 2023 reflect expectations caused by the impact from currency headwinds that will take another two quarters or so to play out.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 44 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $673.8 million in SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), compared to 40 in the previous quarter worth $749.4 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We are well-positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition. High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.” 8. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45  First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) provides global photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions. It is one of the prominent safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio.

(NASDAQ:FSLR) with 3.2 million shares worth more than $426 million. 7. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51    Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. It is one of the elite safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 1, Devon Energy posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $2.18, beating market estimates by $0.05. The revenue over the period was $5.43 billion, up 56.5% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating market estimates by $640 million.On October 18, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear raised the target on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) stock to $96 from $94 and kept an Overweight rating, noting that exploration and productions were back on solid footing heading into the third quarter results after a volatile September due to OPEC and supply cut issues.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 51 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), compared to 57 in the previous quarter worth $1.5 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”6. EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52  EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) explores, develops, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It is one of the major safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 3, EOG Resources posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $3.71, $0.50 less than the estimates of $4.21. The revenue over the period was $7.59 billion, compared to the consensus estimates of $6.62 billion. On November 7, Susquehanna analyst Biju Perincheril maintained a Positive rating on EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) stock and raised the price target to $172 from $162, noting that the company reported solid third quarter results, beating both EPS and production expectations.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Harris Associates is a leading shareholder in EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) with 7.1 million shares worth more than $787.4 million. Alongside Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is one of the best safe energy stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) (+36%), was among our top contributors in the quarter as oil prices rallied due to tight supplies, which were then exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer-term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.” Click to continue reading and see Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Energy Stocks to Consider. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -14%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.11 per share, indicating a change of +51.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +148.4%. This estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.02 indicates a change of +2.9% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $5.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.5%. The $19.95 billion and $19.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +67.4% and -0.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:YUM) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-126-yum-brands-inc-162106647.html,1669738866,STORY,['YUM'],"[Let's talk about the popular Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM). The company's shares led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Yum! Brands’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands What's The Opportunity In Yum! Brands?The stock is currently trading at US$126 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 37% compared to my intrinsic value of $91.98. This means that the opportunity to buy Yum! Brands at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Yum! Brands’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Yum! Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 28% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Yum! Brands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? YUM’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe YUM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on YUM for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for YUM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Yum! Brands at this point in time. Be aware that Yum! Brands is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis and 2 of those are significant...If you are no longer interested in Yum!

286,ede534f6-2129-398b-ad99-c302afe7e016,AON,2022-11-30,Possible bearish signals as Aon plc (NYSE:AON) insiders disposed of US$2.7m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-aon-plc-120055133.html,1669809655,STORY,['AON'],"[Over the past year, many Aon plc (NYSE:AON) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Aon The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AonIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Eric Andersen, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$283 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$303). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 5.7% of Eric Andersen's holding.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 4.40k shares for US$1.3m. But they sold 9.65k shares for US$2.7m. In total, Aon insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Aon insiders own about US$717m worth of shares (which is 1.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Aon Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Aon shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Aon insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Aon you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

It is planning to open more than 1,800 restaurants globally in 2022, which includes 500 openings in the United States and IOM segment and 1,300 (including nearly 800 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market.However, restaurant closures in Russia and Ukraine, coupled with inflationary pressures on labor and commodities, remain headwinds.

Currently, high oil prices are aiding the company's upstream operations. Notably, BP announced plans to execute a $3.5-billion share buyback, which is expected to be completed before reporting the third-quarter results.However, the company's balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, thereby limiting its financial flexibility.

(NYSE: PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, is now ranked second in the nation for on-site solar generation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association's (SEIA) Solar Means Business Report. The report details corporate solar energy use in the United States.""Our solar plans are very ambitious and include a goal of 1 gigawatt of solar and battery storage by 2025. With solar from Prologis roofs, our customers reduce their emissions in an economical way,"" said Susan Uthayakumar, Prologis' chief energy and sustainability officer. ""Communities also benefit from gaining access to renewable energy and improved grid resilience.""With ~1.2 billion square feet of space worldwide1, Prologis has increased the solar generating capacity across its U.S. portfolio from 145 megawatts in 2019 (the last time SEIA released its report) to more than 217 megawatts in the U.S. and 340 megawatts globally (as of SEIA's June 2022 report). As of Sept. 30, 2022, Prologis' solar generation totalled 378 megawatts.""Prologis' strong commitment to clean energy is renewed proof that companies can reliably meet their electricity needs with clean, affordable solar power,"" said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. ""As a leader in logistics real estate and a top commercial user of on-site solar, Prologis is walking the walk to drive the clean energy economy forward.""A Record of LeadershipPrologis began installing solar on the roofs of its building in 2007, generating energy to serve the needs of the building and, in some cases, the local community. For example, in a partnership with the Clean Power Alliance (CPA) in California, Prologis will install solar panels on existing facilities and provide renewable energy to the CPA, which will serve disadvantaged communities by providing fixed-rate, clean energy to local neighborhoods.Story continuesPrologis is also expanding its Energy and Sustainability offerings to provide customers a suite of services including energy efficiency retrofits, energy supply management, smart metering, energy storage and fleet charging through its Prologis Mobility program.""GXO is committed to reducing the environmental impact of our global operations and Prologis' solar offering has been integral to our progress in this area,"" said Chuck Miller, Vice President of Operations and Operations Support at GXO, the world's largest pure-play contract logistics company. ""Prologis made solar simple, which is helping us expand our clean energy program and achieve our goal of 50% renewable energy use by 2030.""Solar Supports Net Zero GoalsEarlier this year, Prologis announced an ambitious commitment to achieve net zero emissions across its value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2040. This includes emissions from tenant energy use. On-site solar generation will play a crucial role in helping Prologis meet its industry-leading emissions reduction goal. Partnering with customers and communities, the company plans to reach 1 gigawatt of solar by 2025 supported by storage.About PrologisPrologis, Inc. is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the call over to CEO, Jeremy Nicoll. Please go ahead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the first-half call for Arvida. I'm pleased to report a very solid set of numbers for the first-half of FY '23. We saw our net profit-after-tax on a IFRS basis of $89 million, which was up 18% on the prior corresponding period. Our key metric of underlying profit was up 46% on the prior corresponding period, to $38.9 million. On an EPS basis, that's up 10% to $0.054 cents per share. Obviously, the first-half that we are reporting, does include a contribution from the Arena villages that we bought in November last year. Operating cash flow was up to $77.4 million, and importantly, our gearing remained towards the lower end of our target range, at 28%, through our stated ranges between 25% to 35%, so very considerably geared going into the next calendar year. Subsequent to the end of the reporting period, we did receive a further $24 million from the sale of a piece of residual land from Waikanae Beach. We settled Waikanae Beach early in the half, and then sold the ramp off and received that money post that offset. During the period, we did refinance our banking syndicate, added $50 million with the limits, and also extended the maturities of those. Very pleased that ANZ and BNZ were very supportive of Arvida and its activities. The real highlight came through from the sales activities, with the total value of our sales up 31% to $168 million. This included $28 million worth of gains from resales at a higher margin of 30%. Development gains also increased, up to just under $15 million at a higher margin of 20%. We did have some impacts through COVID over the period. Obviously, at the start of the period, with sort of the peak of the Omicron pandemic. So during that period, we did restrict admissions to our care facility, and we also incurred higher operating costs through that period. As a result, material occupancy for the half was at 88%, that has rebounded to 90% at September, and has continued to improve to now being at 92%. We have seen the value of our assets increase to $3.6 billion, that's on the back of the development activity going on through the portfolio and also the increase in the valuation of our investment properties of $89 million. NTA per share increased to $1.93, and the embedded value per share increased to $1.53. Based on current trading, we're trading at about $1.30 as of now, so still a significant discount to both of those 2 metrics. On our construction business, we delivered 51 new units during the half, and we are on target to deliver another 219 in the second-half, and I'll talk about those in a bit more detail coming through. We did add 1 further the greenfield site to the portfolio, in Lincoln, in Greater Christchurch and we have 2 sites under conditional contract. On the following page, you can see the increase in our key metrics around revenue up 16%, underlying profit up 46% and then operating cash flow up 12% to $77 million. In terms of strategy, the most important thing is our people and that's both our resident community and also our team members. It's been a pretty challenging period that we've been dealing with over the last 6 months. So at this stage, just like to thank all of our team members for the huge amount of business and work that they've put in over the period and, also to our resident body for helping us work our way through that pandemic earlier in the year. Moving on to some of the development activity, these are lovely shots of Te Puna Waiora and Kerikeri. You can see the progress there that we're making with that development. During the period, we delivered 9 villas up there, with an average value of $920,000, and recently we've been hitting new highs in terms of sales pricing on the next stage of villas that are under construction up there. We saw a pretty solid level of pricing in place, particularly at some of the premium sites, and places like Te Puna Waiora and Waimea Plains, which are our first 2 greenfield development, selling down extremely well. In the second half of the year, we will deliver 219 and 2 of those projects kind of complete right at the end of the financial year, that's Lauriston Park, which is a 63 care suite, and Aria Bay, which has 57 independent apartments. New inventory levels were less than 2%, and that also includes our care suites that we delivered at Rhodes on Cashmere during the period. With the sort of economic outlook for the next year set to weaken, we have retained our build rate target for FY '24 at 250 plus units, and our development mix does allow us to flex on villa builds, if demand slows. But at this stage and we are seeing record levels of demand. On the next couple of pages, we can see some of the projects that we have completed during the period. And also on page 8, some of the developments in progress. As you can see our Aria Bay is well progressed, as is Lauriston Park. Peninsula Club, new apartments, we finished in this quarter and the final stages of villas at Bethlehem shows continued at pace, with a great level of demand. The kids and apartment building at Queenstown is now coming out of the ground, and you can see the picture there on slide 8. In terms of our greenfield developments, we've outlined the 5 different greenfield communities that we have, with the units still to be delivered, as shown in the table. As I mentioned, we have added the Lincoln site at the 11 hectare sites and the aim there is to deliver 200 and 50 care suites. On page 10 is a beautiful picture of a green paddock which is Lincoln. It is well located within a new subdivision at [sites] and the vendor has an ongoing rezoning obligation over the next 12 months. In terms of our overall development pipeline, the pipeline has increased to just over 2,100 units, which gives us plenty of scope and pleasingly, you can see now that that greenfield component of the pipeline, is roughly half of our overall pipeline and without closing out some of our other brownfield development opportunities that we've had within the portfolio. At this point, we'll just hand over to Mark Wells, our Chief Financial Officer to run through the financial picture. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Wells, Arvida Group Limited - CFO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, everybody. Net profit for the period was $89.2 million, but the key driver being the fair value increase of $89 million, an increase of $0.29. Revenue grew 16%, with the contribution of the Arena Villages. The additional operations increased operating expenses to $104 million, with higher COVID and employee costs included in the period. Care revenue was at $58 million on lower care occupancy and divestments. Occupancy in the previous year -- occupancy is improving and the 5.5% funding increase applied from 1st of September 2022. Village revenue increased, reflecting the Arena and also the increased development. On to ORA resales, resales were 164 units, up a pleasing 23% on the previous period. There were $28.3 million resale gains, with increased margins of 30% on the back of a pricing increase of 6%. Over the page shows another strong increase in the embedded value to $1.1 billion, representing $1.53 per share. This is on the back of increased pricing. And on the lower right hand side, the affordability graph shows a buffer still in place between house prices and our unit pricing. The new unit ORA sale -- the period at -- the period was strong with new unit sales gains up to $14.9 million on a margin of 20%. The underlying profit increased to $38.9 million for the period, up 46% on first-half 2022 -- '21, with Arena villages contributing $16 million. Annuity EBITDA increased 52% to $34 million. In terms of the balance sheet, total assets are now at $3.6 billion, with strong development pushing up the investment property to $3.3 billion. On to the capital structure; drawn debt is at $555 million on increased development completions in the second half. In the period, refinance was completed to extend tenures, and additional $50 million added limit to the facility. The gearing was at 28% and the loan-to-value ratio at 31%, being low for the sector. Interest cover was 2.3 times on our general facility, that includes all of the interest. We are in discussions with our banks to remove one technicality in the calculation, and if applied retrospectively, the calculation would be at 3.1 times. Cash flows -- on operating cash flows, this was up to $77 million and increased 12% on increased operations. Strategy and outlook, I'll just pass back to Jeremy Nicoll to continue. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So on the ageing population slide, there is a huge amount of inherent growth within the sector over the next 20, 40 years. So what we're seeing at the moment is very, very strong levels of demand for our product, and this was reflected in our ability to increase the sales prices over the 6 month period. So when you look at all the resales that we completed in the 6 months, on average, but pricing that we achieved was 6% higher than the independent value assist at 31 March, 2022. We've also been able to increase the prices of the ex-Arena villages by just over 10% since acquisition, which has created increases in both the investment value, but also our resale gain line. On strategy, and our direction remains the same. We do want to continue to transform the ageing experience for older New Zealanders. We have an aim to reach 50 retirement communities of scale, that still offer a continuum of care. One of the key things that we have been working on, is how we engage with our people and making Arvida the best place to work in the sector. We've also been very, very focused on how our residents in our communities are treated, and how they're feeling. We're just launching our annual resident survey at the moment, so we'll be able to publish the results of that satisfaction outcome early in the New Year. On the sustainability perspective, we are hitting well ahead of the curve. Recently, Standard and Poor's raised it up in the top quartile globally for our sustainability initiatives. Toitu recently completed the audit of our FY '22 emissions, and on an intensity basis, we are moving well towards our target of reducing them by 20% up to FY '25. In terms of the outlook, there has been a number of issues that the team have been facing in the first half and some of those issues will continue, as we move into the calendar year of 2023. To reflect that, we will retain our annual build rate target at 250 plus, instead of moving it up to 300 as previously indicated. We have the lowest gearing in the sector, and we have a continued preference of villa led [broad] acre development. On the care side of our business, the government funding for care continues to lag the cost to deliberate. We are very pleased that the government made an announcement yesterday, and intends to fund pay parity for nurses in aged care, the details of which are yet to be agreed and finalized, but that work will be led by the NZACA, our (inaudible) body with (inaudible) the Ministry of Health early in the New Year. The government indicated they'll provide $40 million of additional funding through to 30th June, 2023 and from 1 July, 2023 onwards, there was a commitment for a further $200 million worth of funding for nurses. Look, this is a great start, but it does not completely solve the cost of care delivery. It deals with one aspect, which is nurse pay parity with the public system. So there will be continued work from this sector on restoring profitability to enable continued investment into the sector. There have been some changes to immigration policy, that have started to address some of the resourcing debt. But our view has been very, very clear, and that nurses should have an immediate pathway to residency in New Zealand, and the current immigration settings are hampering nurses coming into the country. We are still committed to the continuum of care, based on the current profitability of care. The development at this stage and the future will be all through care suite products, either new or retrofitted where we can. We do want to keep working with the government, as I talked about before about care funding, to enable continued investment into the sector, to help all New Zealanders, when they reach older years, so that they can all get the care that they deserve. In terms of the 1H dividend, we've retained the dividend at the same level as the prior half, at $0.025 per share. There is no imputation credits or supplementary dividend payable to non-residents. We have suspended the dividend reinvestment plan for this dividend payment, given the discount-to-value that we are trading at, and we will actively review this again at the final result. At this point, I'll pause and we'll hand over for questions. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bianca Fledderus of UBS. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So firstly I was just wondering what's the reason if you suspended the DRP for this dividend payment? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Speaking for the [future] is just the level of the share price compared to asset backing. It was a hotly discussed topic on the agenda for the Board. And on-balance, the Board decided that, given where the stock price was trading, that the dividend reinvestment plan would be suspended. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Great. And then just on your balance sheet. So gearing ratio, I guess looks fine at 28%. But yet your interest cover does look quite tight. Since -- I appreciate you mentioned before that you are talking to the bank about this. But how confident are you that this calculation will change? And if not, then will that limit your developments going forward? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Look, we are very confident. And I probably can't say much more than that, but yes, very confident that it will be resolved. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And so with regards to your deliveries for the second-half being 219 units, you are confident as well that you can achieve that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so of the 219, is the 120 at 2 major projects, Lauriston and Aria Bay. Lauriston is really well progressed, that will probably be completed in February, start of March. And Aria Bay is progressing really well, so that will be complete towards the end of March. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just with regards to the current environment, are you doing any sort of promotions like no fees for a year, anything like that, just to try and attract new residents to your villages? Do you have to do stuff like that, or is it still just solid demand for that, I think to pull those levers? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So at the moment, there is significant level of demand. So we don't -- we're not running any above-the-line promotions at any sites. The demand is there. They just need to work-through the health sale process, and in some cases, the people's houses are taking a little bit longer to settle, and that will give them a bit more of a grace period to get through that. And our balance sheet, we will disclose the level of residents advances, and (technical difficulty) buyback about $2 million over the 6 months. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steele of Jarden. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Steele, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The first one from me is, on the current I guess momentum in the business. How things changed, if at all since the trading update at the beginning of October? Is the cost run rate consistent, and is your sales outlook consistent with that update? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so sales momentum is still really, really strong. Probably September was our best month of the year, in terms of sales settlement and that momentum continues into the trading that we've seen in October and November. In terms of the care side of the business, we described the occupancy, which is the key factor. So revenues increasing, as Mark pointed out, the 5.5% increase in care fees was only effective from 1 September. So we'll see the benefit of that number coming through. As you recall, the government thought, it was good to offer 3% increase in our fees from 1 July, and as we disagreed with that, they only paid us a portion of it, for the 1st of July and August. So only a small amount of the increase within the first-half numbers. So you'll see that increase starting to come through in the second half as with previous outbreaks, we have paid our people more to work through those outbreaks. So that really impacted sort of April, May, June, and things are starting to normalize on the loss of hours and employment cost basis. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Steele, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All right. And just following on from your comments on sales momentum, could you talk to how margins have been progressing as well post downsizing the start the second half for both new sale margin and retail margin versus 1H? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so just consistent with first-half really. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Steele, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And whilst I appreciate the details are yet to be ironed out on nurse pay parity settlement, I assume you've done some sort of rough workings on it. Do you have a rough sense as to the potential uplift you might get from it? And do you have a sense as to what that might mean for Improved operational efficiency? Or I guess, another way of putting it, reduced staff turnover, as a result of pay parity? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So you've got the same information as I do, on what the government has announced. I don't have any further information. They're talking about $200 million to pay 20,000 nurses, and that's $10,000 a pop, assuming that they are all full-time workers. We currently employ about 250 nurses, so it was $10,000 a pop, that's $2.5 million. So that's kind of the rough order of magnitude. And then, I forgot the second half of your question, sorry? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Steele, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, it was just on the assumption about that you've done a pay parity of higher staff turnover, assuming it results in low staff turnover, do you have a sense to what impact that might have in terms of improved efficiency on the business? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so if you look at the NZACA Annual Report for -- that was published a few months back, they had the sector turnover for registered nurses at a 48% level. So that gives you an indication of the turnover that the sector is dealing with. Pay parity will go long way towards helping that. But the devil will be in the details, so we do need to keep on working with the government, to iron out the details of how that's going to work. I know there's more pay settlements happening with the public system, what's the implication there. So there is a lot still to be worked through to sort of get a real handle on it. But it's a great first step, we've been asking and talking about it with the government for a number of years now. So it's great that they've finally drawn a line in the sands, but we still need to work through the detail. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Steele, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And just a last one from me is on how you're thinking about acquisitions at the moment. Given where your share price is relative to NTA, how are you thinking about the prospects for potential M&amp;A? And assuming that that's going to be somewhat difficult, if you were to do a larger transaction? What's the necessary run rate of greenfield land acquisitions that you need per annum, to meet current and medium-term development guidance? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so we -- yes, obviously, M&amp;A activity at the moment is particularly constrained, given where our share price is. So we've been trading at a 30% to 40% discount to valuation, buying up, big assets or a group of assets and shaving 30% to 40% off the value of them on day 1, isn't particularly appealing for anybody. So as you've seen, we've -- we have not bought anything since November last year, when the share price was in excess of $2. There's been a number of -- in a couple of public announced portfolios were up for sale. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to complete, though there has been a number of single assets that come across our desk. And again there's not really much point spending much time on them at that point. So we have really pivoted towards the greenfield land strategy. Never say never on (inaudible) acquisitions, but at this point in time, it's not on the radar, and we'd be looking to continue with what we have been doing in the last little while, of trying to look at about 2 different sites or 3 sites per annum of greenfield land. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from the line of Nick Mar of Macquarie. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquarie Research - Analyst [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just following on the nurse question. Where is your pay relative to the DHB rates. And do you have any thoughts on that comments in one of the articles about how those already paying DHB rates wouldn't be eligible funding? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I can't disclose our nurse rates. The comment is one of the details that needs to be worked through. My expectation is that, there will be an increase to the current funding rates, to a level of care to reflect pay parity to nurses, and there'll be some sort of similar mechanism that they've used for caregivers, where there's different grades and minimum rates payable to those different grades. So that's my understanding of how we will pay them out, and in that situation, those big rates would be deployed consistently across the country. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquarie Research - Analyst [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. I guess, just asking maybe in a slight different way, especially as you did get to the $2.5 million you estimated before. How much do you think you can hold on to versus having to pass-through? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I can't talk about that on this call. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquarie Research - Analyst [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay, that's fine. And then just kind of clarity, in terms of the outlook commentary, it's been a little bit confusing from the initial guidance to the update to now. When you talk about the sort of dividends being consistent, are you now at $0.055, or was it still the $0.06, i.e. annualizing the second-half '22 number, which was the original outlook, and from what I understand, the number that you used at the investor update in our portfolio? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so if you're looking at it, I think about the base case being the same as FY '22, so that's $0.055 per share. We want to be targeting at the midpoint, or maybe slightly below it. And if we can, we'll look to increase that second-half dividend as well that, there's a lot to play out in the second-half before we provide anything more definitive than just looking at the same level as last year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquarie Research - Analyst [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And is it correct that essentially, at the sort of investor update, it was $0.06 at the midpoint, which was $0.12 of earnings and now it would be $0.055 somewhere around there, 50% which could be sort of in that $0.11 to $0.115 range, is that a fair way of thinking about it now? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think the fair way to think about it, is the same as last year. And if things go well, there may be some upside on the dividend. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next question comes from the line of Aaron Ibbotson of Forsyth Barr. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aaron Ibbotson, Forsyth Barr Group Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just a couple of quick ones for me, as you've touched on most of it. But firstly, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts around what I thought was a sensible reduction in build rate ambitions for at least FY '24. And I guess my question is more broadly in light of how the market is pricing your stock and the movements in debt and interest rate markets. How do you think about this 25% to 35% gearing target? Is there a case to be made that it could be a little bit lower, is that how I should interpret your sort of slightly reduction in build rate? And more generally, how you're thinking about capital allocation, when it comes to newbuild versus either paying down debt or even buying back some shares at these levels? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So we have made that decision just to keep the build rate at the same level of 250 plus. We do want to be able to have a good mix of what we're building between villas, which are a little bit quicker to recycle the cash, than care apartment buildings, which may take a bit longer. We are cognizant that no one knows what the economic environment in the next calendar year is going to be. So we're very pleased to be going into that period with the lowest gearing in the sector. 28% is a good starting point for us. We do want to keep building through-the-cycle. We do see that, as talked about earlier on, there is strong levels of demand. We are more of a growth stock than a dividend reliant stock. So for us, continuing to invest in our business, makes sense. Obviously, we have talked about share buybacks as an organization, and decided that at this point in time, we'd rather keep our gearing rates at the lower level, to enable us to continue to build through the cycle. So capital management is a key focus for us, as we speak, with those rising interest rates. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aaron Ibbotson, Forsyth Barr Group Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you and apologies to come back to the question around, sort of what I guess is a convoluted earnings guidance through the dividend payout ratio. But I didn't pick up any change in language from this slide 26 versus your update from September, is there a change? Because I read it as being the same message as you gave in September. But your answer to the previous question suggested to me, that there had been a slight down adjustment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So it's just interpretation. So effectively what the slide said, that the dividend for this payout for the full year is likely to be towards the midpoint of payout range. So that's -- in plain language, midpoints -- just being -- it's going to be towards that, which means that it will be -- hopefully in the 40s, but at the high side of 40s, and that we looking at the base case to retain the full year dividend at the same level as FY '22. So it's $0.055 a share. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aaron Ibbotson, Forsyth Barr Group Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. That is sort of what you said in this September update. But I guess, the reason we interpreted that as being $0.06 or the message around it was, more than 2 times 3, than the $0.055. But okay, that is then clear. Thank you very much. Maybe, I am just going to throw it out there, a question on sort of general OpEx and inflationary wage pressures. What are you experiencing at the moment around wages, if we ignore nurses for now, and other costs, should we expect sort of continued sort of mid-single-digit OpEx growth half-on-half, or is it tapering off a little bit? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Wells, Arvida Group Limited - CFO [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey Aaron, I would expect similar rates at this stage. Certainly in terms of general costs, they are being passed through to everybody. And you're right, there is still pressure in those employee type areas, as we know, it's carrying on at least through to the end of this year and probably through to 31 March, by the looks of things. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Shane Solly of Harbour Asset. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shane Solly, Harbour Asset Management Limited - Director &amp; Portfolio Manager [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Firstly, congrats on navigating another -- through a tough half and to your team doing a great job. And also to acknowledge your leading the charge and making people aware of this funding issue that's in here. My question, just in terms of the settlement -- questions in terms of delays, and you had a great chat on sustainable affordability. Can you talk about whether you are seeing much of a gap between the sales and the sales process, or whatnot, and what you might do to address that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, we would -- it's definitely been a half of -- 2 halves casting back to the first quarter, they were -- it was in the middle of a pandemic, and it was a bit more uncertainty that where house prices were going and where interest rates were going. So we did have a lower level of settlements than we expected in that first quarter. In the second quarter, things just ramped back up to where they should be, and even exceeded where we thought. So it definitely did change sort of midway through the first half and we're now at the point where most people know where the house prices are, most people know where interest rates are. There's been some [tightening] out in the lending rules. So we are much more in a period of equilibrium. We're not really seeing a lot of issues, but some people are having trouble selling the house. There's no doubt about that. But that's something that we just worked through, with the resident and we're just going to be on top of it, so we need to know with business houses, what the value is, who is doing the sale or what is the process, what are the timelines, and just working with the prospective residents to help them navigate that, so we can get the right outcome. But we also need to be cognizant that if someone is not going to complete, we need to move on to someone else, because there is enough demand for us to sell the product, we just got to make sure that we're working with our prospects and our databases and that we're trying to give the right results for everyone. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shane Solly, Harbour Asset Management Limited - Director &amp; Portfolio Manager [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great, thank you, Jeremy. Really appreciate it. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, thanks for your comments too Shane. It has been a very, very tough period for the team, and they've done an awesome job through this period. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeremy Nicoll for any closing remarks. Sir? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Nicoll, Arvida Group Limited - CEO [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you very much for your time on the call today. I think Arvida is in a very, very strong position as we move into the second half, for a period of improved performance over what was a very good first half to the year. Thank you to everyone on the call for your support of Arvida. It is really appreciated and we hope if I don't see you before Christmas, you will have a great holiday. I think everyone deserves that after this year. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Please go ahead, sir. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare's Results Conference Call for the First Half of the 2023 Financial Year. On the call today are Lewis Gradon, our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer; Lyndal York, Chief Financial Officer; Paul Shearer, Senior VP of Sales and Marketing; and Andrew Somervell, our VP of Products and Technology. Lewis and Lyndal will first provide an overview of the results, and then we can open it up to your questions for the team. We'll be discussing our results for the 6-months ended 30 September 2022. Earlier today, we issued our 2023 interim report, including financial statements and commentary to the NZX and ASX. These documents can be accessed on our website at fphcare.com/investor. With that, I'll pass over to Lewis. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Thanks, Marcus, and welcome to the call, everyone. Today, I'm going to be referring to the investor presentation pack that we released to the NZX and the ASX this morning. But before we look at our results, I would like to start by recognizing the ongoing efforts of people right across the healthcare sector. While it's been great to see a normalization of sorts after the peak of the pandemic, we do want to acknowledge that conditions remain challenging for our customers. And at this time, I'd also like to make a special mention for the people of Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare. Seasonal illness and COVID-19 have meant that we've had some periods of home isolation and continued disruption to our work environments and to our customers' work environments during this first half. And we're grateful that our people have maintained their relentless commitment, so thank you. So turning now to Page 3. I'd like to call out some of the highlights during our first half, which included continued growth of our anesthesia sales force, the conditional purchase of land for second New Zealand campus and the rollout of a number of new products to more markets around the world. So move on now to the financials on Page 4. First half operating revenue was $690.6 million. This is a 23% decline from the first half of the 2022 financial year and it's a 27% decline in constant currency. As we said in our August update, this result does reflect how we are lapping a period of significant COVID-19-driven demand. It is, however, a solid performance compared to pre-pandemic levels with revenue up 21% compared to the first half of the 2020 financial year. Net profit after tax for the first half was $95.9 million, that's down 57% on the first half of the 2022 financial year and 65% in constant currency. Now CFO, Lyndal York, is here today to unpack some of these figures shortly, but before we do that, let's have a look at our revenue from the product groups, starting with Hospital on Page 6. Hospital operating revenue for the first half is $438.7 million, down 35% year-on-year and 37% in constant currency. New applications consumables revenue was down 20% year-on-year and 23% in constant currency. Now customer inventory levels have played a role in this result. A number of our customers purchased a significant amount of product in the second half of our 2022 financial year to prepare for an Omicron wave, that eventually required less intensive respiratory support than was expected at the time. And as this half has progressed, we saw signs that customers were working through their excess inventory and sales of our hospital consumables have increased month-on-month since May. This trend has continued through the early stages of our second half. Now ultimately, we see the stocking dynamics as short term and the fundamentals of our sales strategy remained the same. Our teams are committed to helping improve clinical practice and ensuring our hardware is used to benefit a broader range of patients requiring respiratory support. Now let's move on to our Homecare product group on Page 8. Homecare operating revenue was $249.9 million, up 10% on the first half of 2022 or 4% in constant currency. OSA masks and accessories revenue was up 16% or 10% in constant currency and a significant contributor to this was the strong reception of our Evora Full face mask. We received 510(k) clearance in April in the United States. And the feedback from clinicians and end users has been very positive. So now I'll hand over to our CFO, Lyndal York, for a more detailed look at the financials. Lyndal? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Lewis, and good morning, everyone. On Page 9, gross margin decreased by 325 basis points to 59.8% for the half compared to the prior corresponding period, down 533 basis points in constant currency. The cost of freight continues to be elevated. The increased proportion of air freight and elevated rates compared to pre-COVID-19 rates impacted our constant currency gross margins by approximately 290 basis points for the half. This compares to a 190 basis point impact in the first half last year as the average road and inbound air freight rates were higher than the same period last year. We have recently been seeing an easing of air freight rates out of New Zealand, which is encouraging. This half, we have also experienced manufacturing inefficiencies as we have been carefully balancing demand fluctuations with manufacturing throughput and higher sickness related rates of absenteeism. We saw sales soften in February and, in response, we progressively reduced our production volume and manufacturing workforce. This resulted in under-recovery of overhead costs, which are largely fixed and labor costs during the half. Our second half constant currency gross margins will likely improve from the first half by approximately 200 basis points, with improvements in the labor under-recovery and freight, assuming current slightly lower freight rates continue. We expect second half production levels to remain lower than last year as we aim to reduce finished goods inventory. At 31 of October exchange rates, reported gross margin in the second half would be approximately 61%. Moving on to Page 10. Total operating expenses grew 8% or 3% in constant currency. Operating margin was 18% as we continued our focused investment through the demand fluctuations over the last few years. R&amp;D expenses grew 11% to $84 million as longer-term projects accelerate. R&amp;D expenses were 12% of revenue for the half. We are estimating that 60% of our R&amp;D spend will be eligible for the 15% R&amp;D tax credit this year. SG&amp;A expenses increased 7% to $202 million and were flat in constant currency. Our sales expenses grew 11% in constant currency as we continued our investment to support the strong hardware sales through COVID and delivered on our anesthesia opportunity. This was offset primarily by a reduction in our profit sharing schemes. Travel and sale events have increased and we estimate they were about 2/3 of the normal expected level for the half, up from about 1/3 of normal levels last year. We anticipate that they'll continue to increase and approach approximately 3/4 of normal levels for the full year. We are targeting operating expense constant currency growth of 8% for the full year, with R&amp;D being about 15% and SG&amp;A, about 5%. At 31 of October exchange rates, reported operating expense growth would be around 14%. Moving on to Page 11. Operating cash flow this year was $2 million, reflecting the lower profit. Our working capital increased as inventory grew and payables reduced. We have increased our raw materials and finished goods as we saw sales soften in February and in response, we progressively reduced our production volume and are managing our long lead time purchase commitments with suppliers. Capital expenditure, which includes purchases of intangible assets, was $125 million for the half. The increase from $81 million in the prior year is primarily due to land and buildings. We completed our third building in Mexico and earthworks continue to progress for our fifth building in New Zealand. In September, we paid a deposit of $27.5 million for the acquisition of land for our second New Zealand campus at Karaka. The purchase is conditional on receiving overseas investment office consent. The next payment for this acquisition of $190 million is anticipated to be in the first half of our 2024 financial year. Capital expenditure for the second half of FY '23 is expected to be approximately in line with the first half, excluding that deposit for the Karaka land. The balance sheet remains strong. Debtor days were in line with the prior year at 42 days. As the majority of our receivables are in foreign currency, revaluing them to New Zealand dollars resulted in an increase of approximately $15 million in the half. Net debt at the 30 of September was $43 million and our gearing ratio was 2.7%. Interest-bearing debt was $112 million, with $70 million of that being non-current. At the 30 of September 2022, we had available liquidity of $312 million between undrawn facilities and cash. Turning to Page 12. We have declared a fully imputed interim dividend of $0.175 per share. This represents a 3% increase on the interim dividend declared last year and continues our recent track record of increasing our dividends to shareholders. It will be paid on the 21 of December. We want to maintain the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet, as we fund our significant infrastructure investments over the next few years, including the Karaka land acquisition, which is a long-term strategic investment. To assist us in maintaining this flexibility and strength, we have reactivated our dividend reinvestment plan. We are offering a 3% discount to the market price commencing with this dividend. Shareholders who are resident in New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, are eligible to participate and need to ensure they are opted-in by the 12 of December to be able to participate for this dividend. Looking now at foreign currency on Page 13. Foreign currency movements positively impacted our profit after tax by $6 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the New Zealand dollar being weaker, on average, through the period. At end of October spot rates, we would have a pretax loss from hedging of approximately $14 million for the full year. And with that, it's back to you, Lewis. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Thanks, Lyndal. So turn now to Page 15. Before we move on to our observations for the second half, I'd like to remind you of our long-term exploration and provide a little more color on our manufacturing infrastructure plans to support our growth. Many of you will be familiar with this graphic. We aspire to sustainably double our constant currency revenue every 5 to 6 years. And you can see that over different timeframes, we expect a progression of different applications to contribute to this longer-term goal. In the short to medium term, we see a very large opportunity for Optiflow nasal high flow with both general respiratory patients and in anesthesia. In both of these applications, we have world-leading technologies and the market remains significantly underpenetrated. In the medium term, we see the opportunity to further develop Optiflow therapy in the home setting. And then for the long term, we're building out our Surgical Humidification set of products and a global sales channel. In our respiratory humidification, our OSA businesses remain a core part of our overall strategy for growth with demographic and geographical drivers. Now to support these overall growth aspirations, we continue to invest in R&amp;D, manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. With the completion of our fifth building in New Zealand in approximately 2025, this current site in New Zealand will be at full capacity. We continue to view New Zealand as an attractive combination of people skills and healthcare infrastructure to continue growing our R&amp;D and pilot manufacturing. And so, we've entered into this conditional agreement during the half to purchase the land for our second site in New Zealand. In prior announcements, we've also talked about options for additional manufacturing locations. And we can now report that we've entered into a lease agreement for a manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China. We have a well-established sales footprint in China, which has been run out of Guangzhou for almost 20 years now. And this new facility is aligned with our distributed supply chain strategy. It will start with a select range of products to service local markets and it provides us with optionality and flexibility to respond to demand over time. So let's look now at Page 16. There's a number of uncertainties, which I think we're all familiar with now leading into the coming half and that leaves us unable to provide quantitative guidance for revenue or earnings at this time. Now as we note in our earnings release, we see a number of factors impacting the period, including the severity and extent of COVID-19, RSV, influenza and that's in addition to the impact of ongoing hospital staffing pressures and potentially surgical backlogs. So speaking on a more qualitative basis, we have a number of things that lead us to believe that second half revenue will be higher than the first half. Historically, sales of our hospital consumables are typically higher in the second half and that reflects seasonal patterns in hospitals. Specifically in the last 2 pre-COVID years, hospital consumable sales were 19% higher in the second half than in the first half in constant currency terms. And in addition, the proportion of customers cycling through their Omicron-driven consumable stock is likely to be lower in our second half than the first half. And in Homecare, the recent launch of our Evora Full face mask in combination with an ongoing improving supply of CPAP hardware is likely to contribute to continued Homecare growth for the remainder of the year. Lyndal has already mentioned our expectations for gross margin and operating expenses for the rest of this financial year, so I'll leave that there. And with that, we're now happy to take your questions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Lewis. We can now take your questions. But before we begin, can I please ask everybody to limit your questions to 2. This is to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to participate. If you do have further questions, you're welcome to rejoin the queue and we can do our best to cover everything off within the hour. So Jenny, I think we can now open the line for questions. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) And our first question today is going to come from David Low from JPMorgan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David A. Low, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Research Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If I could start with the commentary around flu and RSV, we've seen a lot of reports that the incidents of flu in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly the U.S., is weighted towards children. Just wondering what the implications are for Fisher &amp; Paykel's consumable sales if we do see more children than adults and it's perhaps normal? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I think flu most years includes adults and children. We have a neonatal range across everything we do across nasal high flow, across noninvasive ventilation and across invasive. So we just view it as a flu impact historically. This year probably no different, but maybe a bigger impact in the neonatal part of the business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David A. Low, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Research Analyst [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. So nothing to particularly read into that one way or the other if it's a different weighting. The other question is just on hardware. I mean, I think my expectations was after selling so much hardware, we would see hardware sales really sort of fall back to a below normal experience for quite some time. Just wondering if you could talk about your observations there? It seems to have held up better than I had -- I might have thought. I'm just wondering what your expectations are going into the second half and beyond that, please? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes you're not alone with those thoughts. I can talk to what we've seen in the first half, really. In the first month or 2, we saw some COVID-driven demand in hardware in certain countries that had a COVID hospitalization surge. We saw the hardware pickup in those countries. But then in the latter part of the half, the last 4 months or so, we've kind of seen hardware at pretty similar levels to pre-COVID and for pretty similar reasons. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David A. Low, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Research Analyst [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Can I get you to elaborate a little bit on pretty similar reasons? You mean that demand just seems pretty normal? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, it looks like pretty similar volume. When you dig into why are we buying this hardware, it's kind of business as usual. You've got some end-of-life replacements, you've got some fleet upgrades, you've got some hospital expansion and you've got a little bit of change in clinical practice as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for your questions, David. Next question's come from Gretel Janu at Credit Suisse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gretel Janu, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Can you hear me now? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We can hear you now, Gretel. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gretel Janu, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just first question is just around the level of stocking and destocking. Just wondering if you can give us some further color around how it differs between regions? And are we seeing any normal buying patterns return, particularly post the end of that September and into October and November? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You know the complexity around trying to determine stocking and destocking. I would say we feel like there's similar trends across all the regions. In the United States, we have a distributor in the chain. So that adds another kind of step in the stocking, destocking kind of phenomena compared to maybe Europe. Otherwise, I'd say fairly similar trends and that similar trend is an increase during a COVID hospitalization surge, that steep, sharp drop off in February, a couple of months of low levels and then sequential increases. So that's fairly universal. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gretel Janu, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But if we're comparing buying patterns currently to how it was pre-COVID, would you say it is back to normal or is there still significant irregularity from your customers? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think probably the best description we can give for that is sequential increases since May. And on the whole, that's not so normal. Normal would be -- our Q2 would normally be less than our Q1. So I'd say sequential increases is a little bit unusual and probably speaks to the destocking phenomenon. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gretel Janu, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And then just in terms of the operating margin, long-term target of 30%, so trending well below that at least what I understand. But I guess, just how long will it take to get back to that 30% level? And at some point in time, will you look to scale back on the OpEx growth to get there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Thanks, Gretel. Look, we do think that it will take us a few years to get back there. What we want to do is make sure that we're investing in focused areas in the business still and we'll continue to do that. But we will be looking to grow our OpEx lower than our sales growth until we get back to those target levels, which we're confident that we'll get back to, but it certainly won't be a next year thing. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Gretel. Next question comes from Lyanne Harrison at Bank of America. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyanne Harrison, BofA Securities, Research Division - VP in Global Equity Research [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just wondering, are you getting any insight on how the nasal high flow devices are used in the hospitals now, given the reduction in COVID volume? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes we have to rely on anecdotal for that. And I suppose the best I can give you is that most sales people would say they've got a hospital that's considering changing their clinical protocols, is developing new clinical protocols or in the last stages of developing clinical protocols. So we see anecdotal evidence of that change for nasal high flow. But I think we all understand we don't see it coming through in our numbers just. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyanne Harrison, BofA Securities, Research Division - VP in Global Equity Research [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And what is Fisher &amp; Paykel then doing to try and encourage, I guess, increased utilization? And can Fisher &amp; Paykel do anything to accelerate it? Obviously, there's, more devices in the market. Can that -- can they do something to accelerate the usage? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes that's kind of what we do for a living and it's certainly the focus right now. And it really is a process of visiting a customer that's acquired a lot of hardware over COVID in pointing out what the clinical practice guidelines are and then offering to help them implement those clinical practice guidelines. Add some color to that Paul? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul N. Shearer, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, sure. Lyanne, it's Paul here. I mean that's what we do. So we're just spending as much time as we possibly can, getting in front of customers, educating them and servicing them if they haven't had a lot of service during COVID, educating them to the applications outside COVID, different areas for hospital. We would talk to them about that, helping them go and talk to the clinicians in those different areas. So this is the work we do all day every day and we've been doing for many years and it's just a continuation of. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyanne Harrison, BofA Securities, Research Division - VP in Global Equity Research [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And would you say that level of interaction with customers, would that be -- would you say that's similar to the levels that you had pre-COVID or would you say that are more elevated since then? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul N. Shearer, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, it's starting to get there. I mean, we're starting to get pretty good access in most hospitals around the world. So the problem that has been access has really been a stumbling block. And I think generally speaking, we're now getting pretty reasonable access to hospitals, commissions. These people are still very busy, so that makes it harder. So I don't think we're getting back to over than what it was in the past but I think we're staying to head towards getting more normalized access to the people we need to talk to. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Lyanne. Next question comes from Saul Hadassin at Barrenjoey Capital. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Saul Hadassin, Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited, Research Division - Analyst [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just one, in the media release talks to seasonal patterns as it relates to your hospitals, consumable sales, noting 19% higher sales in second half versus first in pre-COVID times 2018, '19. I just want to work out what relevance that has to this half that we've just finished, Lewis, maybe some comments as to is that a trend we should read into this fiscal '23 year or is that first half revenue figure for consumable still difficult to interpret based on what's happened with destocking and stocking, et cetera? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes I think I would say yes to all the above, so it's difficult to read into the first half and all that. In the absence of data points, we think probably the best data point we can point to is FY '18-'19, where -- and for all of our history, just about second half is higher than the first half. And it's generally related to more hospital admissions in the Northern Hemisphere over our second half than our first half for all sorts of reasons. So in the absence of other data, that's probably about the best point we can give you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Saul Hadassin, Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited, Research Division - Analyst [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No problem. Okay. And just a question on OpEx. So just noted that the -- for the half itself, the constant currency OpEx growth was below what you guided to, I think, going into the first half. And I think for the full year as well, the guidance in constant currency is now also below where we were thinking it might land back at the Investor Day, when I think that guidance was given. In terms of your ability to just flex that OpEx up and down, now that we're sort of into the second half, how much control do you have over that full year guidance of 8%? Do you think that's sort of a very realistic number or do you still have the leverage to pull that down if need be? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I'll pass that question over to Lyndal. But just a little bit of background there is that when we looked at this financial year, we thought we would try and aim for an OpEx growth, which would be a compound annual growth of FY '20, our last normal year of about 11% and that's what we were aiming at. And we did say at the time, that's what we're going to try and do. That seems to make sense. But we did say at the time that might be challenging and that's kind of what's played out. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes and I guess just to expand on that, look, we knew that it was quite optimistic to set those targets at the beginning of the year, which is why they're coming down as everybody is experiencing, just taking a little bit longer to hire the people that we're wanting to do. Travel and sale events haven't ramped up to normal entire lease is just taking a little bit longer to get that back up to speed, nothing that we're overly worried about. And again, as I said to Gretel's question, we're making sure that we're continuing to invest in focused areas in the business for the long-term growth and the sales of the hardware that we've made through COVID and to make sure that we make the most of our anesthesia opportunity and that's not really changing. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just want to make really clear that we haven't intentionally pulled back OpEx growth from our initial guidance. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And sorry, just one other thing. The lower profit share schemes are playing into that a little bit as well this year on a year-on-year growth. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for your question, Saul. Next question's come from Chris Cooper at Goldman Sachs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chris Cooper, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just a follow-up on that OpEx question, I had something similar. At the Investor Day in May, I mean, the reason for the OpEx guidance that you gave was primarily focused on the need to build sales reps and prioritize that sort of effort in terms of proportionately where the incremental COVID demand had been placed, clearly, you've got a role here to make sure these devices are going to continue to be used. But by not being able to effectively hit that OpEx target, is there any sort of concern in your minds that you don't have the necessary sales reps in place, which is going to sort of drive that additional utilization you were hoping for when you were speaking in May? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul N. Shearer, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Well, probably I'll chip in on that one. A lot of that sales question, a lot of the salesperson growth occurred last year, so not tired about that particular part of it. Do you want to? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And I guess I just would point out, Chris, that we've got 11% growth in our R&amp;D and sales offices this half. So that is actually a good solid growth. Again, that focused investment. So we're not concerned about that. We're continuing foot down in those focused areas. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chris Cooper, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And to your previous comments, Lyndal, as well, are we to interpret this as more of a deferral of some of the OpEx that you had expected to come into '23, that's now going to be deferred into '24. Is that the right way of thinking about things? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, that's probably the best way of thinking of it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chris Cooper, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, I understand. And gross margin, so that's now guided to 200 basis points up in the second half from what was previously flat. You commented in your statement today that sort of New Zealand freight rates are sort of softening but still lagging the global easing. So I just wanted to clarify, is the upgrade based on the view that New Zealand costs will continue to follow global costs down or just based on spot today in New Zealand, you can upgrade by 200. And then the lagged easing should provide further upside into fiscal '24? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So there's, 2 components to that improvement in constant currency gross margin in the second half compared to the first. Freight rates part of it, but it's about 1/4 of it. It sort of 50 basis points based on rates that we're seeing today, which are sort of after the end of the first half, but we have seen them come down. And if they continue, we'll see that. Now obviously, if they -- if the decrease accelerates, there's potential further improvement there, if other components spike up, it could go either way. The other big factor there is the labor under recoveries that we had in the first half will reduce significantly in the second half as we've reduced our manufacturing workforce through the first half being primarily the temporary employees in New Zealand that we hired during the COVID spike as well as through natural attrition in Mexico. So coming into the second half, a lot of that labor under recovery would go away assuming that production volumes remain fairly comparable half-on-half to aim to reduce the finished goods inventory as we're hoping to do. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Chris. Next question comes from Matt Montgomerie at Forsyth Barr. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Matt Montgomerie, Forsyth Barr Group Ltd., Research Division - Equity Analyst [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe just firstly, back on to gross margin. Just trying to get a feel for the track into '20 or the second half and '24. Would you be able to split out the impacts that you talked to in terms of the mix manufacturing inefficiencies and then the freight impact and in terms of the 5 percentage point delta between your target? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. So the one thing that I would point out is -- when we're talking reported gross margin, exchange rates are at a very favorable place for us at the moment. So with exchange rates where they are today, we'd actually be wanting to overshoot that target somewhere around 67%, 68%. And that's why you see the difference in the constant currency and the reported year-on-year impact of gross margin. But the key then shifts other than that sort of currency from our target of 65%, we've got about 290 basis points of freight. Now we are hoping that a little bit of that starts coming away next year. That will be a bit dependent on freight rates. We don't think all of that will come away. Some of it will stick with just where that is; we're not 100% sure. The labor under recoveries is sort of about 150-odd basis points and then the overhead under recoveries is sort of the balance of that. So there's no real major impact. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Matt Montgomerie, Forsyth Barr Group Ltd., Research Division - Equity Analyst [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. No, that makes sense. And then maybe secondly, sort of going back to broader insights through the hospital and talking to a lack of bandwidth for clinical change. Would you be able to talk to that by geographies and particularly in your core North American and Europe markets relative to maybe the newer markets that you've sold into through the pandemic? Just trying to get a feel for growth, by region at a utilization level going forward? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, that's a tough one. Look, when you talk to individual salespeople from different regions, you really don't get much of a different story in terms of the dynamic and the day-to-day interactions. I'd say that part of it is fairly consistent, do you think? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul N. Shearer, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Correct I think it is. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I suppose growth by region, I'm just thinking -- sorry, about your growth by region part. I guess there probably is a difference there. And that is when you go outside North America and Europe; you've got countries that have come off a tiny, tiny installed base that had a massive growth in installed base, relatively speaking, during COVID. I think that's a slightly different dynamic. They're a big part of the drop this half, but they're dropping to actually what's, a pretty high level compared to FY '20. So I think that would be a different dynamic. Other than that, North America and Europe, similar with one exception, you've got a distributor in the chain in North America, which adds to the overstocking and then adds to the destocking time frame a little bit. Otherwise, the dynamic in the hospital, I would say, is similar. Is that helpful? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for your questions, Matt. Next question comes from Stephen Ridgewell at Craigs Investment Partners. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stephen Ridgewell, Craigs Investment Partners Limited, Research Division - Head of Institutional Research [49] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just first question for Lewis. Switching gears a little bit to product. At the Investor Day, you showed us some really interesting new products. Can you talk a little bit to the rollout of Airvo 3 in the market response so far? And in particular, is the market accepting the higher price point for the added functionality and what you're seeing so far and I understand it’s the early days. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [50] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Yes, good point, early days. So Airvo 3 at present is available in New Zealand and Australia. We have some, I'd call them, controlled release sites in Europe, probably not widely available in Europe until early next year and certainly hitting the price point. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stephen Ridgewell, Craigs Investment Partners Limited, Research Division - Head of Institutional Research [51] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I mean just when you think medium term Lewis, I mean, what proportion of hardware or hospital device sales, which you hope Airvo 3 might be able to achieve? And are you expecting sort of different years, if you like, and systems where there's like Europe and North America, where there's perhaps more funding for this kind of device? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [52] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve, going forward, I don't know, we're fairly agnostic to the hardware. So I think maybe the only difference would be markets that have been penetrated or had usage of Airvo for a period of time would be coming around to some upgrade cycles, so that's North America, Europe, Australia. Other than that, I can't really think of any color to add. Can you? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Somervell, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Products &amp; Technology [53] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I just think that the -- it's a very good product, Stephen. It's been -- we've shown that customers, conditions in Australasia and outside Australasia. People really appreciate mobility, the battery. There's lots of good features on that additional to Airvo 2. So I think we're just going to find that there's going to be growing demand for the product as we have time to get from customers. And they get a view on it appreciate it and get funding for it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul N. Shearer, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing [54] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I suppose I can add one other bit of color on that is one of the common hurdles to using nasal high flow throughout a hospital, everywhere in the hospital is portability moving patients around and that's something Airvo 3 facilitates. And that's -- so far, that's a very. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stephen Ridgewell, Craigs Investment Partners Limited, Research Division - Head of Institutional Research [55] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just may be one for Lyndal. On the tax rate, which was 16% in the first half, certainly lower than I was expecting. I mean can you just tell us a little bit what's driven the tax rate that low? And are you able to provide some guidance for tax rate in the second half and perhaps beyond? Is this a bit of a one-off, a low tax rate or you expecting lower tax, effective tax rates going forward? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [56] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Look, the biggest sort of impact in the first half there is the currency translation. As you're very well aware, different currencies have been very volatile through the half. And so certain of our currency translations are taxable or tax deductible and certain of them are not. And so when you add up the combination of that, you can get a bit of a weird-looking tax rate at times. Nothing has changed in the long term in terms of we expect an effective tax rate of around 28% to 29%, excluding the R&amp;D tax credit. And as we've guided to today, about 60% of our R&amp;D spend, we'd expect to be eligible for that R&amp;D tax credit. So in the absence of ongoing currency big different currency volatility in the second half, we'd expect the second half tax rate to be more in line with that and the go forward in line with that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [57] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Stephen. Next question come from Adrian Allbon at Jarden. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [58] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just wondering, just coming back to the first half, new apps consumables revenue, which I think are around $260 million. Are you able to kind of give us a call out of how much is anesthesia? And maybe also just comment on what you're sort of saying in noninvasive just so we can sort of then make our own assessment of what's going on in Optiflow. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [59] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. So anesthesia, a bit over 5%. And then a noninvasive ventilation, I think the way to think of all that is nasal high flow is most sensitive to the COVID movements, the overstocking and the destocking. Noninvasive is a little bit less sensitive to the COVID movements and then invasive is less sensitive again to the COVID movements. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [60] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. So sort of from that as a relatively stable like on a PCP basis? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [61] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wouldn't go that far. I would just -- if less variation. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [62] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just like on the same theme, like just noting that, I guess inventories were circa $400 million. Like on your second half observations here, would you be expecting to sort of bring that down by about $100 million as a target as we sort of round out the year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [63] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, Adrian, that will all depend on what our revenue is doing. So we're estimating that our production volume will be lower than sales. That will be our aim for the second half to try and reduce at least our finished goods inventory where that lands will absolutely depend on where revenue lands in the second half, which we're not binding to at the moment. We don't have enough information to be able to guide to that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [64] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But just aren't you guiding to like the second half revenue being higher than the first half? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [65] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're not guiding to that. We're saying that's our historic trends, seasonal trend. And we would anticipate second half would be higher. But we're not saying what sort of quantum that would be. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [66] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. But if that was to be achieved, like how much reduction in sort of -- I guess the other question is this peak inventory -- like if you had your observations or what you're saying in the second half being ahead of the first half? Like can you give us any sort of sense of how far the inventories would come there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lyndal York, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - CFO [67] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We would hope that it's peaked at the moment for finished goods. We are aiming to reduce our finished goods going forward. I guess the one thing that I would say is the most important thing to us is to make sure that if a patient needs our product, they have it. So we're not focused on really driving down inventory to a very minimal level. We want to make sure that there's always product when it's needed. We feel like we've got room to move that inventory down at the moment and still be able to satisfy that and that's what we're aiming to do. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [68] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There's no real inventories target. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [69] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And then perhaps just a couple of other timings like that would be helpful. Can you -- is there any sort of update on the FDA approvals that you're sort of waiting for like 950 Airvo 3 into the states? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Somervell, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Products &amp; Technology [70] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's Andrew here. I'll answer that question. We have a number of products like the 950 that are going through by 510(k) process at the moment. But it's very, very difficult to predict the time line for those. So I can't really give you any more information except that they are underway right now. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [71] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And Airvo 3? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Somervell, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Products &amp; Technology [72] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So that's one of the products that's going through 510(k) process at the moment, but the same story. We can't really predict the timelines for that right now. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [73] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian, if you think predicting revenue is tough, if you think predicting revenue is tough predicting when the clearance is even tougher my friend. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian Allbon, Jarden Limited, Research Division - Director of Equity Research [74] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then maybe just on Homecare. Just in terms of the response you have had for Evora, like how much do you think the sort of fill-up situation is sort of aiding there to the extent you can sort of separate it? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [75] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, we've got a lot of drivers going on there. We've got a new product that's had a fabulous reception. We've got CPAP. CPAP supply improving over time and you've had fill-ups, have had some difficulties. So it's impossible for us to call out what the drivers are. I think it's fair to say we don't think fill-ups problems have been a major driver. We think it's more about the reception to a vertical. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Somervell, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Products &amp; Technology [76] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrian, the Evora, there's a very, very good month. We had an excellent reception from it. And we think that's driving growth. We don't know how much. But it's -- had a very good reception in the marketplace. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [77] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for your questions, Adrian. Our next questions come from Marcus Curley at UBS. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Curley, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of New Zealand Research [78] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just wondered if you could provide any observations around the equipment sales within the hospital business. Obviously, Lewis, you spoke about that remaining at a relatively surprising level. Are you able to see which hospitals they're going to? And does it tell you about what's happening to the existing stock of flow generators within the hospital? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [79] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you go specific hospital, hospital by hospital at a point in time, the answer to the question is yes. When we've explored why that hardware is being purchased; we can definitely nail down what it's for and that's still going. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Curley, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of New Zealand Research [80] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And does that suggest that, let's say, the surplus equipment still hasn't been relocated -- or is it necessarily being easily used on other applications at the moment? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [81] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think it suggests if they're buying hardware. It's all those reasons. I've got some old product. I mean I think that's all it tells us. I've got some old product that's end of life. I've added some beds to my hospital. I want some more equipment. We do also see fleet upgrades. If they've upgraded all of their ventilators, they might like to upgrade all of their humidifiers, so all these things are still occurring. All these kind of normal -- these are all normal reasons why we might sell hardware. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Curley, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of New Zealand Research [82] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. But yes, just to be clear, you've got hospitals that bought loss of equipment during COVID who are now buying more equipment today? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [83] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Yes, for all those reasons. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Curley, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of New Zealand Research [84] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And then secondly, this is probably a little longer term. But I suppose when you look at your experience with new application consumable revenues, as Adrian mentioned, around $260 million, it's about 26% above pre-COVID levels 3 years on. Traditionally, this, I suppose, part of the business used to grow at 20%. When you think about the next couple of years, do you think you're sort of overdue some higher-than-expected growth or is it still a situation where you're sort of going to bed down a new level and sort of look to reaccelerate it towards where it used to be? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [85] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, if you go back to pre-COVID, we were thinking that that 20% number you mentioned, it does step that growth rate steadily decreases. But over time, the math is because it becomes a bigger proportion of your business, the end result looks good. So where we sit relative to that pre-COVID, I mean that's, I was just going to say that's a million-dollar question, isn't it? That's what we're still trying to gauge. We feel like we should be ahead. But I mean, I'd probably think of it more as maybe maintaining that growth rate rather than accelerating it up would be how I'd be thinking of it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Curley, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of New Zealand Research [86] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So just to be clear, maintaining the growth rate that you've seen over the last 3 years relative to pre-COVID or the growth rate that you saw before pre-COVID? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [87] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I was thinking about maintaining the pre-COVID rather than -- we were thinking it would steadily drop so -- as a growth rate. So yes, maybe not such a steady drop going forward. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Curley, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Head of New Zealand Research [88] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. But not necessarily jumping up above the growth rate on the basis that you sort of overdue sort of a couple of years of uptake, if you like to call it that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [89] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hard one to call. Over a couple of years, we think we'll be ahead. So we'll be ahead of where we would have been. And there could be some jumps in our future. But if you want to smooth things out over 4 or 5 years, we're thinking we're ahead. We're probably ahead of where we were at pre-COVID and pre-COVID we were thinking that growth rate steadily declines. So we're thinking if you want to go ahead and smooth over 5 years, maybe we can maintain closer to that pre-COVID growth rate. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [90] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Marcus. Next questions come from Mathieu Chevrier at Citi. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mathieu Chevrier, Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Assistant VP &amp; Senior Associate [91] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The first one is just around the challenges that you're facing when you're trying to get your new Optiflow customers to actually use the device on a more regular basis? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [92] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I think probably the best descriptor of that, we did a survey of Canadian hospitals a few months ago, I forget the exact number. But it was something -- 20-something percent of our customers, were aware of the clinical practice guidelines. So I think really that's the challenge. It's an age-old challenge. It's what we normally do. There's actually nothing unusual in that. And it's about getting those clinical practice guidelines in front of our customers and working through it with them. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul N. Shearer, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing [93] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And making sure they adhere to us. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [94] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And then once -- there is a second step, Paul's pointing out. Once they've signed off and agreed and I think the clinical practice guidelines make good sense. They can put protocols in place and that's a good step, but then they also have to follow the protocols is the next step. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mathieu Chevrier, Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Assistant VP &amp; Senior Associate [95] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And then 6 months ago, you've given us some scenarios around the potential hospital consumable sales growth over time, assuming that 85% of the devices that you sold during the pandemic would actually get used. How is your thinking around those scenarios evolved since then? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [96] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe I should put that into a context. So what we were doing at the time is we were trying to provide a context for the opportunity. So we said that if 85% of this hardware is used, if it returns to a very long-term historical average consumable usage and if that takes 3 or 4 or 5 years, this is the kind of growth rates you can see. And the point was that that installed base of hardware drives pretty decent growth rates. And whether you assume 15% isn't used or 20% or 10% or whether you assume 5 years or 3 years or 8 years. The only point of that model was to say, hey, that installed base, however you look at it, drives pretty decent growth in consumables. So I don't want you to stick on the 15% as it's a number or an expectation, it's kind of just a model. Go ahead, do you want to add to that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Somervell, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Products &amp; Technology [97] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'll just add Mathieu for that over the last 6 months, the impact of stocking, destocking hasn't really given us any further insight into… -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [98] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's a really, really good point. And if you look at the last 6 months, we've sold hardware and consumables volume was down. So it kind of tells you pretty clearly that's not a predictive model or a go-forward model that we provided. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mathieu Chevrier, Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Assistant VP &amp; Senior Associate [99] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Yes, understood. And just finally on your choice making Guangzhou, your next manufacturing hub. What are the factors that make you decide on that location versus others? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [100] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So the overall strategy is geographical diversification in local manufacturing. So we've had a sales team based out of Guangzhou in China for over 20 years now. So that's the logical place. It is a manufacturing hub in China. So that makes it a logical place and China is a large and growing market for us, so that also makes it a logical place. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [101] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for your questions, Mathieu. Last question, last person in the queue is Dan Hurren from MST. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dan Hurren, MST Marquee - Healthcare Analyst [102] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Look, we've had a little bit discussion on the call about the 950. I know we can't talk about or expect when it will be launched. But 2 questions around that, 1, what's been the experience in the 950 in the market that has been operating in? And 2, is the market right through a new product? Is this one of those sorts of cyclical times where these large fleets rigs upgraded or do we still -- will that also be impacted by the big hardware buy that we saw during COVID? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [103] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Look, historically, for us, when we introduced new models of hardware, that's like a 10-year kind of changeover time frame and 950 is no different. Typically, customers don't want to have 30, 850s and 5, 950s when they get 5 more ventilators. So they can go in 850 for quite a long time until that gets into life and then they might look at upgrading to 950s. Do you want to add color to that, Paul? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul N. Shearer, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing [104] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, I do. Yes. I mean it's like a 20-year cycle actually. But the reality is, is that the 950 is a very good product. I think in -- it's extremely well received. And that was an area, of course, where COVID wasn't suddenly -- COVID rate had depicts. And we just had been making very good progress. It's a very good product. And we'll just get selling the products as we go. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dan Hurren, MST Marquee - Healthcare Analyst [105] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I guess what I'm asking is to put simply, did we sell a whole bunch of 850s? Is there is holding to 850 due to COVID period, which has made the average age of the installed fleet younger than it normally would be. I guess I'm just trying to understand how we should model the launch of 950 and what that will be a software hurdle which is what I'm trying to get to. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [106] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I mean clearly, that's correct. You've got a younger average age of the fleet. But when we model going forward, given Paul's 20-year kind of life cycle, upgrade cycles never really that material. It's not something we actually model going forward or plan on it. It's kind of a continuous process. If you think of it as a 20-year upgrade cycle and introduce a new product every 10 years, it's kind of -- it's continuous. It's not a cycle of oh, got a new product, rush out and upgrade everything. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marcus Driller, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - VP of Corporate &amp; Company Secretary [107] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Dan. That's the end of our questions. So I'll pass it back over to Lewis to conclude. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lewis G. Gradon, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited - MD, CEO &amp; Executive Director [108] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Thanks, Marcus. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call and thanks a lot for your questions. I would like to end on a note of thanks for -- to all of our shareholders for your continued support. So thank you very much, and enjoy the rest of your day. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [109] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Mander Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO ================================================================================ Conference Call Participants ================================================================================ * Grant Lowe Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research ================================================================================ Presentation -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My name is Simon Mander, and I'm the CEO of Metro Performance Glass, and with me is our CFO, Brent Mealings. This morning, we will provide you with an overview of the group's results for the 6 months to the 30th of September 2022, and we'll then be happy to take any questions. Turning now to Slide 2. We've noted 4 key messages which summarize the year. I'd like to start by noting challenging market conditions faced in the first half, particularly in New Zealand. We've been focused on our customers, recovering of our gross margins and preparing the business for the expected increase in Low E glass production as a result of introduced building code changes. The series of price increases we have introduced are beginning to show in our margins from the second quarter, and we expect this to continue through the second half. Australian Glass Group delivered on its turnaround plan achieving a significantly improved performance driven by solid demand and price increases. Our net debt has increased in the first half, primarily driven by an increase in working capital due to ongoing supply chain disruption, higher-value inventory and debtors. We also commenced a cost-out program, and I'll expand on this program with initiatives later in the session. Moving to our key financial results for the first half on Slide 3. Group EBITDA of $5.6 million was an increase of 78% on the prior comparable period, driven by a full trading period without a lockdown and significant price increases in both New Zealand and Australia. Net debt increased from the full year to $59.1 million, driven by working capital requirements. Our leverage ratio remains consistent with the full year result at 3.8x. During the period, Metroglass concluded an additional year extension on its current syndicated banking facilities out to the end of October 2024. On Slide 4, New Zealand revenue of $100 million was up 14% versus the previous comparable period with an EBIT of $3.6 million, down 15%. Q1 was a major contributor to the earnings impact in the first half with the additional price increases introduced in June and September, beginning to recover margins in the second quarter. All of our segments faced disruptions in supply chains, project delays and people availability challenges that impacted operational efficiency. In spite of this, all segments delivered improved results in the prior year, primarily driven by a full trading period and the price increases. Our focus on continually improving the customer experience continues to reflect the positive levels of customer satisfaction, achieving a 7.9 out of 10 in our latest survey in May 2022. Another key milestone is the installation of the new furnace of the Highbrook plant in Auckland, and this project has progressed very well and is undergoing its final commissioning phase now. On Slide 5, in light of the year-on-year decline in volumes and an expectation that further declines are likely later in the new calendar year, Metroglass is undertaking organizational review and implemented a series of initiatives across the group to ensure capacity and resources are appropriate to service demand as the cycle changes. Following recent investments in processing capability and furnace capacity at our Auckland and Christchurch plants, business is now in a position to rationalize its production footprint and we will cease manufacturing operations in the Bay of Plenty by the end of December 2022. Metroglass will continue to have sales recommendation, commercial and residential blazing resources in a retrofit presence in the important Bay of Plenty market. The overall cost out program, including the Bay of Plenty site rationalization is expected to achieve annualized savings in the New Zealand business in the range of $8 million to $9 million, with benefits occurring from the second half of FY '23. Regrettably, these changes impact on a number of our people, and we are committed to supporting our impacted team through this period. On Slide 6, Australian Glass Group's revenue of $38.2 million was up 32% versus prior year with an EBIT of $2.6 million, up $3.3 million from the modest loss in the first half of FY '22. We're also pleased to see solid gross margins in that business. AGG delivered on its turnaround plan, achieving revenue and EBIT targets for first half '23, supported by stable operating performance and price increases. Also pleasing to see that New South Wales business has made a significant turnaround in the half. AGG now enters the next phase of its strategy, having achieved its turnaround and is well positioned for growth alongside the increasing adoption of double glazing and changes to the National Construction Code, NTC, coming into force in 2023 that will further accelerate its uptake. I'll now hand over to Brent to discuss the financial results in more detail. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Simon, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, we break our revenue down. And in New Zealand, you can see an overall increase of 14% as all segments achieved year-on-year improvements. As Simon has already mentioned, we are also happy to see continued improvement in the AGG business. Slide 8 reflects our half year results. Segmental results are on the right-hand side of the page. New Zealand's gross profit margin for the half was impacted by the increase in input costs prior to the scheduled price increases progressively introduced in Q1. In line with expectations, we have begun to see margin improve from Q2. In Australia, gross profit margin almost doubled, in part reflecting the price increase in response to cost inflation pressures, but also in recognition of the increasing value of Glass throughout the industry. Turning to the group results on the left-hand side of it, our net profit after tax increased from $400,000 to $600,000. I'd like to move to the waterfall on Slide 9. Movements in New Zealand's EBIT results are shown in gray shading. Our New Zealand EBIT result was $0.5 million lower than the prior year, with higher revenue offset by increased input costs that we were unable to offset by market price increases at the same rate. Increases in distribution and glazing were partly offset by savings elsewhere. Turning to the Australian performance, which is in the green shaded area of the waterfall. The encouraging story here is revenue growth and gross profit margin profit improvements. It has largely offset the inflationary cost pressures. ACT has achieved a solid turnaround in profitability in the half. Turning to the balance sheet slide, Slide 10. Net operating cash flows were significantly below the comparative period primarily driven by requirements on working capital. Capital expenditure has reduced to $5 million in the first half with a focus on targeted investments and maintenance checking only. On our big points on the slide, we have noted comparisons between the first half of 2022 and the full year 2022. I'd like to focus on comparisons to the full year ended 31st of March. Net debt has increased by $6.8 million since March, driven by the working capital requirements and inventory primarily with our leverage ratio consistent with March 22 at 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. Back to you, Simon. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks. Now turning now to the outlook for FY '23 on Slide 11. The number of residential consents in New Zealand has been running at elevated levels and well above the industry capacity, supporting a stable pipeline of work in the near term. However, we expect that economic headwinds are likely to reduce the number of dwellings actually constructed later in calendar year 2023. Updates to the H1 building code, applicable consents from November '22 will support an increased demand for higher-performing Low E glass, and this will have positive impact on gross profit performance. The overall cost-out program, including the Bay of Plenty site rationalization is expected to achieve annualized savings in the New Zealand business in the range of $8 million to $9 million with benefits accruing from the second half of FY '23. Any slowdown in Australian construction activity is likely to be offset by increases in the market penetration of double glazing and accelerated by the upcoming changes to the National Construction Code in 2023. We believe we are very well positioned to meet the requirements and opportunities for them to book the upcoming changes in the New Zealand and Australian building insulation regulation code changes. Finally, on Slide 12. The Metroglass' strategy and focus remain unchanged as we continue to build resilience and defend our leadership position in a competitive New Zealand market, grow profitability of our Australian business and benefit from increasing demand for double glazing to ensure our balance sheet is strong and sufficient to table future risks and opportunities. Now that brings us to the end of our presentation, and we're now happy to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's Grant Lowe from Jarden. Can you hear me okay? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Just so looking at the geographical results, firstly, just in terms of New Zealand, I see gross margins were down $41.6 million versus $44.4 million in the first half last year. Can you give us a sense as to the split quarter-on-quarter, you filled out that the second quarter was an improvement on the first? Just trying to understand that momentum coming out into the second half. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So as we sort of described, Grant, Q1 was difficult at a gross profit performance level given the timing of the price increases, which we start beginning of June and the beginning of March, and the one at the beginning of June was $11.75 million. So it was quite a decent increase. So what we've seen is from Q2 onwards, quite a good improvement in our gross profit and we're (inaudible) appearing into the second half. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Is it reasonable to assume that it might be at around the 44% in the second half? Or is that (inaudible) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What percentage did you say? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If it was 44.4% in the first half last year. Is that a reasonable assumption going into the second half? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, I don't think that'd be too far off we would be aiming for. Yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Excellent. And then in terms of Australia, just so I understand correctly positive result there, which is great. You've said that any slowdown in construction activity is likely to be increased, offset by increases in market penetration and changes and the like. Are we to sort of looking into at any major changes? Are we expecting that earnings might be able to remain at these levels going forward just by scope? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Good sense. Around the debt side of things. I guess I was surprised to see that to go up by quite so much. In terms of, obviously, working capital driving that. In terms of -- we think that at the moment is working, our working capital levels sort of a reasonable go-forward basis? Or are there -- do you expect to see some unwind either in terms of inventory or receivables in particular? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The major driver of the -- apart from the price increases, which obviously have an impact, but the supply chain disruption is still an issue we're having to deal with in terms of our safety levels. We're holding something like 40% more inventory at the end of September compared to March. So to the extent that the supply chain disruption starts to settle down in the new year, we see that as an opportunity to wind that back, but it's been in the recent weeks, there's been -- you probably have seen the press around the New Zealand ports in particular. And this is probably a Christmas as well. So we're hopeful that beyond into the new year, we can find that out. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Okay. So in terms of that 40% lift September versus March, is that in dollar values rather than volume? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's volume. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Volume. Okay. Right. Okay. So yes, okay. So that's 1 to watch over time. In terms of the -- its facilities, you've called out an extension to the -- your main facility by a year. Is that still remain at $75 million facility? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The total facility is $80 million. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Including the arbitrage? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorry, Grant. What's that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think it was at the -- it was $75 million plus $8 million or so of overdrafts. Is that one, it's similar? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. It was -- the original facility was $75 million plus a standby of $10 million, $85 million. So we've effectively got a $75 million plus at standby, $5 million. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Understood. And in terms of the organizational review, I appreciate there is still obviously work to do around that in some sensitivity. But just in terms of making sure I've understood that correctly. So the $8 million or $9 million of benefits growing, is that net of any assumed revenue loss? Or is that just purely cost savings? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Purely cost savings? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We've shown that purely it's cost savings. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Okay. And so in terms of -- presumably, you mentioned that you're still going to have free into the year in terms of the glazing and retrofit of Bay of Plenty. So obviously, we have additional costs associated with trade down to Bay of Plenty, can you give us a sense of what that offset might be? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's about (inaudible) -- the $8 million to $9 million would be this effect. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorry, say it again? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It would be -- that would be the net benefit. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Okay. Are you able to get any sense of the sort of additional costs that are offset within that net number? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think what we're saying is that if you -- we'll be distributing from Auckland to that customer base, the $8 million to $9 million is included there. So that's the net. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And in terms of -- I see them actually account for -- none of the accounts for -- none of the accounts refers to cash plus savings of $34 million associated with the (inaudible) manufacturing facility plus the $8 million to $9 million that's after depreciation presumably. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No. that's -- there's other cost savings across New Zealand that make up the remainder of that. So about half of those cost savings are achieved in the (inaudible) and the remaining guidance across the rest of the business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brent Mealings, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CFO [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And just in terms of the way that plays out within that sort of said $8 million to $9 million, around about $2 million will sit in admin, which is related to the other cost saving initiatives that we've got focused on. And then there's a few change of it is obviously both in these other initiatives that we're doing. And majority of it sits in the gross profit line and the factory costs as the fixed cost base, right? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grant Lowe, Jarden Limited, Research Division - VP of Equity Research [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And last one, just around that. In terms of -- I mean, you're maintaining your -- how do you see the local competition or the risk of revenue loss? Or is that you believe you can continue to service that region without revenue loss? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Look, we're confident that we're able to maintain our revenue there, and we're working with our customers through that. So there's that risk is everywhere. It's a competitive industry. We maintain a very strong presence there, so the manufacturing of the product is not there. And we already supply -- because of the manufacturing limitations in that plant, we already supply a reasonable amount of the product we sell in that region from outside of the region. So we're quite -- and then we deliver down regular or (inaudible) and stuff like that out of our open part as well about any part. So yes, there's always some risk when you do something like this. But on balance, we're confident in what we're doing there. And there's some significant benefit likely. And we still have a very strong presence and the amount like we do in our other branch networks that we have around the country and the regional towns. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) And it appears there are no further questions at this time. So I'll turn it back to you for the conference for any additional or closing remarks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simon J. Mander, Metro Performance Glass Limited - CEO [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Well, thanks, everyone. If you have any further questions you think of later, don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you.]"

Welcome to Kiwi Property FY23 Interim Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Clive Mackenzie, CEO. Please go ahead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, [Dilem]. [Kia ore], everyone, and good morning, and thank you for joining us for Kiwi Property's interim results announcement for the six months ended 30 September 2022. I am Clive Mackenzie, the CEO of Kiwi Property. And today I'm joined by our CFO, Gavin Parker, and our Head of Investor Relations, [Cam Hodgetts]. Assume you all have a copy of our presentation in front of you. If not, you can access one from the Annual Results section of our website at kp.co.nz. A quick reminder that as usual, we have included detailed financial and property slide in the appendices to this document. I'll take the disclaimer as read, so please turn to slide five. As you all aware, we are operating in a challenging economic climate, high inflation, rising interest rates, and a labor supply shortage has created a significant uncertainty in the market. During this volatile period, the delivery of our strategy is more important than ever. Our evolution from a retail and office landlord to the creator of connected communities continues to gain momentum. While this transition will take time, as you will hear today, we sustained a robust operating performance over the past six months, while taking the business closer to our goal of becoming a developer, owner, and operator of mixed-use assets at key metropolitan centers and transport hubs. We believe that by intensifying our mixed-use assets, leveraging diverse capital sources, enabling the success of our customers, and driving operational excellence, we'll be in the strongest position to grow shareholders' returns. Kiwi Property's active leasing and asset management platforms are source of competitive advantage and have enabled us to maintain highly productive assets despite the impact of COVID-19. You will recall the consistent rental and sales growth delivered across our portfolio over recent periods. And we are proud to have maintained this positive trajectory. During the six months to 30 September, Kiwi Property earned a $100 million in net rental income, marking a new record for the company. Despite concerns about the macro-economic climate, we grew rents by an impressive 4.9%, while continuing to keep our high-quality asset portfolio almost fully occupied. Sales across our mixed-use and retail assets were up nearly 10% on the same time last year, with the Sylvia Park precinct alone generating more than $750 million in sales over the past 12 months. And importantly, we achieved all these milestones while continuing to improve the quality, resilience, and sustainability of our assets. Our focus on ESG was rewarded with the [GRESB] score of 81 for the year, placing us among some of Australasia's most successful reach. These figures are testament to the strength and resilience of our assets. As we've been saying for some time, flagship retail destinations are continuing to go from strength to strength even as second-tier assets come under pressure. Data released by NZ Post at the start of November showed that with Kiwis now settling into a post-pandemic norm, there's been a shift from online to in-store shopping. Online spending fell for the second quarter in a row and is now below where it was two years ago. At the same time, in-store spending is now 14% above pre-pandemic Q3 2019 levels. Discussions about the future retail often overlooked the fact that not all retail is the same and it shouldn't be viewed as such. We are proud to own and operate as some of New Zealand's best shopping destinations, putting us in the driver's seat to benefit from retail to clear bifurcation. We made significant progress on our targeted development program in the first half, bringing Sylvia Park's transformation into a world-class mixed-use community ever closer to fruition. Construction of the precinct's 295 built-to-rent apartment complex is moving forward at pace with the steel superstructure now up to three levels high in some places. This exciting project will help embed Kiwi Property as a leader in BTR in New Zealand and help us to capture the financial benefit that we believe will flow from the new asset class over time. Elsewhere at Sylvia Park, the new six-level medical office development at 3 Te Kehu Way is advancing with similar momentum. The building's exterior is now complete, with its innovative and distinctive design already becoming a prominent feature on the Mt Wellington landscape. Internal fitouts are now underway at 3 Te Kehu Way and is on track to be completed in the first quarter of 2023, marking a next step towards the creation of a thriving commercial precinct at Sylvia Park. Around two-thirds of 3 Te Kehu Way's net lettable area is either committed or subject to advanced negotiations, with an impressive lineup of tenants in place, including Tamaki Health, Horizon Radiology, Geneva Finance, and co-working operator, IWG. In addition, the redevelopment of Sylvia Lane was recently finished, creating an exciting new all-weather dining precinct. Sylvia Lane is set to become a cornerstone of the center's entertainment offering, providing an attractive place for people to eat, drink, and socialize. The enhancement of Sylvia Lane is expected to drive [customer and chain] demand, helping to generate sales, and ultimately, rental growth. In early November, Kiwi Property's Drury Private Plan Change was approved by the Environment Court, confirming our landholding as the site for the future metropolitan Town Centre. Stage one earthworks are now underway Drury, marking the next step in Kiwi Property's ambition to create a six Green Star, transit-oriented community south of Auckland. The earthworks are expected to take two years at a cost of around $30 million. Pleasingly, the [upzoning] of our [Drury Site] has already delivered valuation gains, with the landholding now worth more than double the purchase price. And expected to increase further once earth and civil works are complete. With the Private Plan Change now secured, we've also resumed the Fast-track consenting process with the goal of accelerating resource consent and facilitating the creation of 13 residential super-lots. The potential sale of these super-lots will enable us to realize returns from the project and assist with future funding. The disposal of non-core properties and subsequent recycling of capital is a central pillar of our funding strategy. And we've made important strides on this front in the six months to 30 September. Today, we announce the unconditional sale of 44 The Terrace in Wellington for $48 million, with $2 million retained for seismic costs. The transaction is expected to settle on December 15, 2022. And delivers a property level IRR of 12.2% from inception. Westgate Lifestyle has also now been listed for sale, following the disposal of Northlands Shopping Centre in Christchurch for $151 million, net of seismic costs, which is due to settle on November 30, 2022. The proceeds raised from these transactions will be used to repay debt and fund our development pipeline, delivering what we believe will be better long-term value for shareholders. One of our business' strengths is its large strategic landholding, including more than 125 hectares across our mixed-use assets at Sylvia Park, LynnMall, The Base, and Drury. This landholding provides an extensive range of options and provides the flexibility to dictate the timing and speed of our development activities. We currently have around $217 million of development expenditure remaining at 3 Te Kehu Way and Sylvia Park build-to-rent. We are proactively managing pricing and expect both projects to maintain the target yields that were previously disclosed to the market. While these developments and the stage one earthworks at Drury present exciting opportunities for Kiwi Property, we'll maintain a cautious approach to the timing of further activity. New developments will only occur when market conditions, cost, and return metrics are acceptable. Our priority is to ensure the right financial conditions and suitable funding are in place before any further construction projects begin. So, we're making the best use of shareholder capital. Kiwi Property posted a strong operational result in the first half of the FY2023 financial year, delivering growth in key metrics such as sales, rental income, operating profit, and adjusted funds from operations. As I've already mentioned, net rental income rose to a record high of a $100 million, up 6.3% on the same time last year, driven by sustained revenue uplift at Sylvia Park in particular. Operating profit before tax was also up, increasing 4.2% to $65.1 million, reflecting the pleasing performance of our diversified asset portfolio. AFFO rose 35.8% to $65.2 million, assisted by the release of COVID-19 rental abatement accruals, which were not required. The company's robust operational result was unfortunately unable to offset the impact of rising interest rates and the global softening of capitalization rates. As a result of these headwinds, the fair value of Kiwi Property investment portfolio declined by an unrealized 5.8% or $213.3 million, causing the business to post a net loss after tax of $151.1 million. While the decrease in fair value of our property portfolio and subsequent impact on net profit is disappointing, it's not unexpected given the well-documented challenges facing the global economy. By actively managing our assets and tightly controlling our cost [base], we'll be in the strongest position to maximize asset vaues going forward. The company continue to drive strong rental growth during the period, including a 4.9% increase in new leases and rent reviews across our office and mixed-use portfolio. Our ability to increase rents while simultaneously securing a pipeline of new tenants is a testament to the demand for space in our assets, led by Sylvia Park, LynnMall, and The Base. This demand enabled our portfolio to remain almost fully occupied at 30 September and achieve a robust weighted average lease expiry of 4.6 years. Retail sales continue to bounce back strongly post COVID-19 with reduced Auckland lockdowns, enabling stores to trade for 13 more days than they did in the preceding 12 months. Total sales were $1.51 billion on an [MAT] basis, up around $280 million on the prior comparable period, a very good outcome considering cost of living pressures currently facing Kiwi consumers. Total sales growth was an impressive 9.6% on the prior year across our mixed-use and large format retail centers combined. While specialty sales at our mixed-use shopping centers increased to $12,900 a square meter, specialty gross occupancy costs were 12.1%, a favorable position compared to many Australasian REITs, highlighting the highly productive and well-placed nature of our retail tenancies. Kiwi Property undertook several capital management activities in the first half of the financial year, including increasing our bank debt facilities from $850 million to $950 million. Post the reporting period, our bank debt facilities were increased to $1 billion, and the weighted average term of all debt facilities was extended to 4.1 years. In line with most of our listed property peers, we have also granted mortgage security in respect of our properties and increased our bank gearing covenant to 50%. The weighted average cost of debt grew from 3.85% to 4.41%, driven by the increase in interest rates that have been a recent feature of the international and domestic economies. Maintaining a robust and flexible balance sheet is a priority for the business in the current market. The previously mentioned unrealized reduction in the fair value of our property portfolio, so our gearing increased to 35.7% as at September 30, 2022. Net asset backing per share was similarly affected, decreasing to $1.31 per share. It's important to note, however, that once our gearing figures adjusted on a pro-forma basis to reflect the settlement of Northlands on 30 November and 44 The Terrace on 15 December, pro-forma gearing decreases to approximately 32%. Kiwi Property will pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01425 per share, taking year-to-date interim cash dividend to $0.0285 per share, up almost 4% on the prior period. Today, we are pleased to confirm our full year dividend guidance at $0.057 per share, representing a gross dividend yield of 9.3% based on the current share price and assuming a 33% personal tax rate while enabling us to retain earnings to fund growth. As always, it's important to note that the payment of any further dividends is contingent on the performance of the company through the remainder of the 2023 financial year and barring material adverse effects or unforeseen circumstances. As you have seen, Kiwi Property delivered a strong operating result in the first half of the 2023 financial year and took important steps forward in the delivery of our strategy. As we head into the second half of the financial year, we have four specific priorities. First, we'll strive to maintain balance sheet flexibility and capacity through a combination of cost control, capital recycling, and strict financial discipline. Second, we'll advance to stage one earthworks at Drury and move forward with the Fast-track application, taking us closer to having the option of selling down super-lots in order to release capital. Third, we'll continue pushing forward with a dedicated leasing program at 3 Te Kehu Way, with the aim of having all tenancies committed in time for opening. And fourth, we will continue to drive operating excellence across our high-quality asset portfolio with a focus on growing rents, maintaining high occupancy, and working alongside tenants to achieve sales growth. While we're cognizant of the macro-economic environment, we're focused on the factors within our control, delivering on strategy, intensively managing our assets, seeking out opportunities to benefit from the current market volatility, and striving to grow the share price. Before I wrap up for the day, allow to add one final thing. Today will be Gavin's last results announcement after 20 years with the company. He's been an excellent CFO and trusted advisor to me, our Board and management. And I want to wish him all the very best for the future. We're well advanced with our recruitment for Gavin's replacement, and I look forward to making an announcement on that front shortly. Thank you all for joining today. And that concludes my overview of our interim financial results. I'll now hand over to the moderator, who will open the phone lines for questions. Thank you. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And I show -- our first question comes from the line of Arie Dekker from Jarden. Please go ahead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning. [Just fit] this question may be in the detail, but I couldn't find it. Could you just say what Westgate Lifestyle's book value is at first half '23? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, it was $50 million. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No, Westgate Lifestyle -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Oh, sorry, Westgate Lifestyle. Sorry. I thought -- sorry -- I thought you mentioned 44 The Terrace, my apologies. Yeah. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The value at 30 September [REIT] is -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think it's 95 million. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's 95 million -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yeah, 95 million. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. So, it's consistent with FY '23. And just on 44 The Terrace [stood] the cap rate at first half '23? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.38% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.38% Thank you. Just on 3 Te Kehu Way, which is obviously nearing completion, what's the commitments level versus advanced negotiations? I think the commitments was around 30% at full year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, commitments are just under 60% at the moment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's 60%. And, in terms of I mean, obviously, you're going into a break in that as well. But you've sort of got enough progress that you think there's a decent chance that you'll pay pretty close to fully leased up at completion? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, absolutely. That's the objective. And we're very pleased to see the level of interest from medical office tenants and medical tenants, which was one of our objectives. So, we're seeing that momentum carry forward as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yeah, I guess it's getting critical mass. That's good. Just on one-off costs, are we going to feature again in second half '23? Or is that for $30 million in first half? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Certainly the [pay] cost will feature in the second half [REIT] because that's sort of a circa two-year project. So, they will feature in the second half. The first half also included some costs for our office platform, which we've expensed in the first half. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. Yes. So just to get a bit of a sense of -- would they [are] pay costs in the second half? Would they sort of pay roughly half of what were the one-off cost called out in the first half? Or is it less than that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It would be at least net how it came. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- to that at least half your costs. And then just final one, I mean, obviously, you've talked to some new developments and market conditions and that sort of thing. I mean, what would it be fair to say that, as things currently stand, there is nothing sort of new that you would be anticipating to commit to in the calendar year '23? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yeah. That's correct, other than what we've already announced yet. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yeah. And then just on the $30 million for Drury is that committed, or do you still have flexibility on that? Or it's not committed? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Obviously, we've got the earthworks underway at the moment, but we can stop at any point here. So, we can. (Multiple Speakers) It is a two-year program, yeah. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just on terms of funding outside of Westgate Lifestyle, there's nothing else planned for divestment at this point? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Not immediately now. No. We are constantly looking at our portfolio to see what are strategic assets for us as we move forward. And so that process will continue. But we're obviously well advanced with the asset sales that we've called out, yeah. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arie Dekker, Jarden Securities Ltd - Managing Director [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Mar from Macquarie. Please go ahead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquerie Group Limited - Analyst [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Morning, guys. Just concerning the guidance, is there much to read into the change [within] from sort of at least or no less than 5.7% to just 5.3%, and just sort of in the context of the fact that it was a pretty strong first half, [I suppose] we still expect to be within the 90% to 100% range at the full year basis? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No, there's nothing in it that coming out. Obviously, we're conscious of the yield that we're currently providing. And so, with terming out guidance at 5.7%, obviously, [FFO] will be more than that. Yeah, the 90% to 100% payout is used as a guidance. And, you know, last year we came in, I think, at a 88%. And we'd expect to come in under the 90% this year as well. I mean, obviously, it makes sense to retain earnings given our current yield and our development pipeline. It just makes sense to withhold it, retain further earnings. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquerie Group Limited - Analyst [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are there any sort of lumpy numbers to come through in the second half? Obviously, maintenance incentives were quite low in the first half. It covers sort of a slight positive inflow and any sort of depreciation recovery or cost like that on the asset sales that will [settle]. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yeah, you've called out the two obvious sort of, I guess, one-off benefits in the first half, which is the abatements that were not required, which have been reversed to the FFO. And also, maintenance CapEx in the first half was lower than expected or what you'd expect in the second half. So, they won't feature in the second half, although you'll see in the the abatement slide in the pack that we're still carrying $1.4 million in the footnote, $1.4 million that further abatement growth. We've got the final handful of tenants to resolve. But I would expect that we won't need to do are all of that $1.4 million. So, there might be a little bit more shakeout in the second half. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquerie Group Limited - Analyst [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And just in terms of the commentary around development, you mentioned the return metrics are unchanged in terms of the yield on costs. Is there a cost creep offset by better rents in any of those projects or other project land costs? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, there's a bit of that. Obviously, there is cost pressure coming through it. I mean, it's affecting every project out there. But we're fortunate that we are seeing rising income on the other side to offset those. So, at the moment, [there are] remaining balance here. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquerie Group Limited - Analyst [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So what would the total project cost now be on the bill [screen]? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We haven't got an update for the market on that number at the moment here. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquerie Group Limited - Analyst [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just on the gearing covenants and it sort of increased, which is sort of in line with the sector. But the bottom one remains at 45%. How does that work having two different numbers? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yeah, that's right, Nick. So, as I said, [there's this] sort of provision or transition over arrangements. So, in effect, the banks benefit from the bond covenant at 45% and less we go to bondholders and seek to increase the bond covenant to 50% as well, there is some -- typically, it's an event of review rather than event of default. So, yeah, it's 50% until -- sorry, it's effectively 45% until the bonds either roll off or the bond covenant is amended. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nick Mar, Macquerie Group Limited - Analyst [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That looks good. Thanks a lot. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And I show our next question comes from the line of Bianca Fledderus from UBS. Please go ahead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS AG - Analyst [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning. Just following up on new developments commitments, I'm sure you mentioned these were only able to grow when return metrics are acceptable. Are you able to share what sort of return metrics you are looking for in the current environment to make new developments accept towards the near medium term? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning, Bianca. No, we don't have an update for the market on that at the moment. Look, there's a lot of uncertainty around cost prices coming through from the construction sector. There's a lot of uncertainty on interest rates, inflation. So, yeah, we -- this is not from our perspective. This is the time just to be cautious and not to rush into any new developments. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS AG - Analyst [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just with regards to the first month of trading of the second half, are you starting to see any sort of negative impact from cost of living pressures, especially your mixed-use and retail assets? Any sort of comments around that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Not at this stage. And, in fact, we've just had the Black Friday weekend that just went through. And I can let you know that the sales were very strong in comparative to pre-COVID levels as well. So that [momented] carried on. Yeah. So, yeah, we haven't seen any pullback at this stage yet. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS AG - Analyst [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And I guess just following on from that, GOC, that was a good improvement, obviously compared to the same period last year. I guess that is sort of a hard measure to forecast, but do you expect GOC will likely increase further or some stabilize around that 12% level? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's a hard one to predict depending on what happens in the economy and how the consumer reacts. But at this stage, we aren't seeing any change to that. So, look, it allows us quite a large buffer -- a to grow income over time. But also, in case the economy really deteriorates significantly, there is a buffer for our retailers as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bianca Fledderus, UBS AG - Analyst [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Bianca. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [49] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Clive Mackenzie, CEO, for closing remarks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clive Mackenzie, Kiwi Property Group Limited - CEO [50] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, everybody, for joining. Appreciate your attendance this morning, and we look forward to catching up soon. Thank you, bye. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [51] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) was founded in 1984 and is based in Louisville, Kentucky. The company operates and franchises pizza delivery and dine-in restaurants under the Papa John's trademark in the United States and internationally. It operates through four segments – Domestic Company-Owned Restaurants, North America Commissaries, North America Franchising, and International Operations. Story continuesCredit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman on November 4 maintained an Outperform rating on Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $97 from $123. Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) posted a disappointing Q3 print, though its long-term outlook remains resilient, the analyst told investors. Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) remains one of the analyst's favorite names in restaurants, driven by a multi-faceted sales strategy, accelerating unit growth, and margin expansion.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 22 hedge funds were bullish on Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 20 funds in the prior quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.75 million shares worth $193 million. Like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) is one of the best delivery stocks for 2023. Here is what Artisan Small Cap Fund has to say about Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Papa John’s is a global operator and franchisor of pizza delivery and carryout restaurants. The company is tracking nicely against our turnaround thesis which hinges upon an improvement in store-level economics leading to accelerating growth in restaurant development activity. Improved store-level economics is being driven in part by market share gains resulting from menu innovation. New menu items—parmesan crusted Papadias, Epic Stuffed Crust, Shaq-a-roni— coupled with enhancements to the digital/loyalty platform and supportive advertising are attracting new customers to the brand, increasing frequency of its existing customers and driving higher unit volumes and returns. As a result, the company is experiencing incremental interest from new and existing franchisees to develop new restaurants. Papa John’s opened a record 123 units in the first half of 2021 and now expects to open 220-260 new stores this year (vs. 140-180 previously)—most of which are outside of the US. Combined with ample white space globally, we believe a higher unit growth trajectory will drive an attractive and sustainable profit cycle.”10. Lyft, Inc.

However, the analyst expects its present challenges to be temporary and believes that Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)’s long-term prospects remain resilient.

(NASDAQ:LYFT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), the second-largest ride-hailing company in the US, connects riders and drivers over a mobile app. When we began our GardenSM campaign, our thesis was based on a likely strong ridership recovery post-pandemic, as well as management’s growing focus on increasing profitability after years of heavy investment. While the company has made some progress on margins as the economy has re-opened, driver shortages and fuel inflation have disrupted that progress. Given uncertainty around when these cost pressures could abate, we exited our position.”9. DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41DoorDash, Inc.

(NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

They also raised the price target on the stock to $220 from $197.Guys, a really a two part note here by Amit Mehrotra over at Deutsche Bank. One, he says the near-term investors are perhaps too focused on any potential volume, misses, because of the economic slowdown. And then, two, longer term, he likes what the company is doing operationally under CEO Carol Tomé, just operating a more efficient business.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, they said the bottom line here is that UPS shares, it appears to them, as overindexing transitory headwinds, they are calling-- rather than or saying against some of the structural opportunity for consistent profitable growth. And so what we've seen is kind of a divergence now between how the Street is looking at a FedEx versus a UPS. And for UPS, being able to even in the current environment right now, as this buy thesis has stated.Even within this environment, stewarding the necessary kind of changes right now to make sure that they are not only delivering at a time where they know that some of the volumes could fluctuate here. Not just among the end consumers who are trying to figure out, OK, do we have the ability to spend the same level that we did midpandemic?And for FedEx, for UPS, that's where kind of that divergence takes place. And it really also comes down to how many end businesses that you're gonna continue to engage with. And for a lot of those businesses, they've just passed that cost through to consumers as well.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, one minor red flag I will note here, UPS has a key labor union contract up for renewal next year, covering a large part of employees. If I have it right, UPS has not seen a strike in over 25 years so that is something to watch out for.Now, people familiar with the matter have told me, that they expect to get this deal done and relatively quickly. But again, something to watch going forward.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean Mehrotra doesn't seem concerned about the strike. He thinks it will be more benign than expected. I mean, you have a lot of contrarian calls. This is quite a contrarian call, right? And it's kind of interesting how he looks at the history and says that the other times when it was at these levels, it was is when it ended up doing well.BRIAN SOZZI: Big difference--JULIE HYMAN: So we'll see.BRIAN SOZZI: --versus FedEx. I mean, the sentiment on UPS versus FedEx headed into next year couldn't be more different.BRAD SMITH: Yeah,JULIE HYMAN: Well, in theory, that's when it's time to buy, is what he's arguing. So we'll see if he's right.]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressThe Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$154. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in American Express than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At American Express Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at American Express. insider Walter Clayton spent US$149k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Story continuesDoes American Express Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. American Express insiders own about US$133m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The American Express Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. Overall, we'd prefer see a more sustained buying from directors, but with a significant insider holding and more recent purchases, American Express insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that American Express has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course American Express may not be the best stock to buy.

Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for third quarter and fiscal year 2023; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; our alignment with industry megatrends and expectations regarding the future growth in the number of cloud customers and their usage of cloud services; our ability to deliver innovation and focus on strategic growth opportunities while optimizing our operating costs; and our ability to drive sustained growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as inflation, rising interest rates and foreign exchange volatility, the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions; and the IT capital spending environment, including the focus on optimization of cloud spending; as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our evolved cloud strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, and manage our gross profit margins and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections.

I'll now turn the call over to George. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Kris, and welcome, everyone, to our Q2 FY '23 earnings call. Coming off a strong Q1, our team delivered a solid quarter with all-time highs for Q2 billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. We remain focused on disciplined operational management and the execution of our strategy, which is tightly aligned with customer priorities. On today's call, I will walk through 4 topics. One, we delivered a good quarter in a dynamic environment. However, we are disappointed with the deceleration of growth in our cloud services. Our conviction in the cloud opportunity and our ability to execute against it is unwavering. Two, we are aligned with the durable megatrends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We continue to deliver innovation that furthers our already strong position. Three, we believe strongly in the opportunity ahead, but have slightly tempered our revenue outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year due to near-term macro headwinds. Four, we understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a slowing environment and will focus on our strategic growth opportunities while continually optimizing our operating costs. Let's start with the first point: our performance in the quarter. Q2 public cloud segment revenue increased 63% year-over-year to $142 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate remained healthy at 140%. However, Public Cloud ARR of $603 million fell short of our expectations. As our cloud partners discussed on their earnings calls, growth has slowed as customers look to optimize cloud spending. This macro-related optimization caused some slowing of growth in our cloud storage services, as well. Additionally, we had a few customers with very large project-based workloads, like chip design, that came to their natural conclusion, resulting in capacity reductions in those environments. We expect these customers to kick off new projects early next calendar year. As the number of cloud customers and their usage of our cloud services grows, the impact of this type of workload will be smoothed over a much broader customer base. In our cloud operations portfolio, Spot is benefiting from the same desire to optimize cloud spending that was a headwind to our cloud storage services. Spot's value proposition is a strong engine for new logo acquisition and Q2 saw an acceleration of new Spot customer additions from Q1. As we've discussed on past calls, we continue to refine our approach to Cloud Insights and are seeing early positive signs with the growth of new Cloud Insights customers in Q2. We continue to see healthy growth of new to NetApp customers and of existing NetApp enterprise customers adopting our cloud services. And those customers are growing in scale, as well. The number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR has more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated and create customer preference for NetApp. We have a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors in this critical market, positioning us well to deliver sustained growth. Compared to Q2 a year ago, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 3% and our all-flash array business increased 2% to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Adjusting for the significant FX headwinds, Hybrid Cloud grew 8% and all-flash grew 7% in constant currency. All-flash penetration of our installed base grew to 33% of installed systems. Our lower-cost, capacity-oriented all-flash arrays and FAS hybrid flash arrays both performed well. On to the second point: our alignment to the industry megatrends and our continued innovation. The world is moving faster than ever, raising data-driven digital and cloud transformations to business necessities. NetApp helps meet these objectives with a modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management that we term the evolved cloud. We provide customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security and sustainability, which increases our relevance and value to our customers. We believe strongly in the sizable, durable and growing opportunity created by these megatrends. As many of you know, we bring significant value to customers running VMware environments on-premises. With a series of announcements made in conjunction with VMware, we are now able to bring that same value to customers in the cloud. Our native cloud storage services, integrated with VMware, helps customers quickly, easily and cost-effectively migrate enterprise workloads to the cloud and accelerate modern application development using Kubernetes. We are the only certified and supported third-party cloud storage solution for VMware Cloud, which creates significant new opportunity for us. As those VMware environments move to the cloud, we can capture the data that resides on competitors' on-premises systems. At the start of November, we introduced BlueXP, the next big step in fulfilling our vision to give customers the simplicity, security, savings and sustainability needed for an evolved cloud. It delivers true hybrid, multi-cloud operations by bringing storage and data services together in a single unified control plane. BlueXP is a highly differentiated solution that enables customers to deploy, discover, manage and optimize not only infrastructure and data, but supporting business processes across multiple clouds and on-premises environments. In addition to bringing forward technical capabilities, we are helping customers achieve their environmental goals by creating energy-efficient products. We've added power and temperature reporting in Cloud Insights to give customers a real-time view into energy expenditure, and our carbon footprint reports provide a reasonable estimate for the carbon impact of their NetApp systems. We enhanced our storage efficiency with a 4:1 efficiency guarantee for SAN workloads to help customers minimize their storage footprint and lower energy usage. We not only help customers practice sound environmental stewardship, we practice it ourselves. I'm proud to announce that EcoVadis, the leading evidence-based ESG rating agency, awarded NetApp a gold ranking, placing us within the top 7% of evaluated companies. Now the third point: the macro environment and our business outlook. As we moved through the quarter, we saw increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher-level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles and some deals moving out of the quarter. In Q2, we felt this most acutely in the Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors. We see no change to our underlying opportunity and are confident in our position. However, current economic realities and unprecedented FX headwinds are and will continue to impact IT spending, causing us to temper our revenue expectations for the second half. And finally, point 4: driving shareholder value. In response to the slowing top line, we are being agile and taking action to lower operating expenses. Already, we have implemented a broad-based hiring freeze and are reducing discretionary spending as well as further optimizing our real estate footprint. We will remain disciplined as we continue to shift resources away from lower-yield activities to our biggest opportunities. In closing, we are clearly aligned with our customers' strategic priorities and remain confident in our long-term opportunity, despite the current external headwinds. By focusing on what we can control, we will aggressively seek to maximize the near-term return on our product and services portfolio while leveraging our leadership position in all-flash, cloud storage and cloud infrastructure optimization. I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for delivering a strong first half. In a challenging environment, we remain focused on innovation, execution and operational discipline. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number 1, as George highlighted, we delivered a strong Q2 in a dynamic environment, with all-time Q2 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. Number 2, we have adjusted our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year due to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number 3, as we navigate through the current macro environment, we are laser-focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. As George noted, we have taken actions to reduce our full year expense envelope and will remain fluid in assessing further opportunities to take costs out of the business. Number 4, as a result of these cost-saving measures, the entirety of the op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental 1 to 2 points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call. And number 5, we continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23. We now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q2 billings were $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.66 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 540 basis point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 9% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q2, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the 6 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.52 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Product revenue of $837 million increased 3% year-over-year. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $607 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $603 million, up 55% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million, up 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $749 million was up 11% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency, constituting 45% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $4.1 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year or, 10% in constant currency. Q2 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66.3%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q2, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a 3-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was accretive to the corporate average for the eighth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q2 highlighted the strong leverage in our business model, with operating margin of 24%, including 2 points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.48 came in nicely ahead of guidance and included a $0.21 year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $214 million and free cash flow was $137 million. Q2 included our annual repatriation tax payment and continued cash outflows for certain inventory and premiums for constrained trailing-edge analog parts. Additionally, collections were lower than expected due to a back-end loaded quarter for invoicing linearity that you see in the higher accounts receivable balance. Our component purchasing strategy allows us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but remains a clear headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through the second half of fiscal '23. During Q2, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $258 million to shareholders, representing 188% of free cash flow. Share count of 220 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. Additionally, currency headwinds have only continued to increase. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes 5 points of FX headwind versus the 4-point headwind assumed in our prior guidance. We now expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of approximately $700 million, which equates to our public cloud segment driving 3 points of total company revenue growth for the full year. Three drivers are impacting the near-term growth rate of Cloud ARR. Number 1, in this macro environment, we project continued optimization of storage services as we help our customers manage their spending, which benefits Spot, but will offset some incremental near-term storage services ARR. Number 2, we expect that project-based workloads will grow in both number and scale. But as they ramp, it will take some time to materialize into sizable ARR. And number 3, we continue to tighten up the Cloud Insights sales motion, but we don't expect this meaningful cross-sell opportunity to materialize until we head into fiscal '24. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in U.S. dollars. We are optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring parts at significant premiums. We should also see a benefit from declining NAND prices in Q4. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 23%, which now includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind and EPS of $5.30 to $5.50, which now includes more than $0.70 of currency impacts. It's important to reiterate that we are offsetting the full year revenue adjustment with an extremely disciplined approach to our spending envelope. As a result, the entirety of the op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental 1 to 2 points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23, as we sharpen our portfolio focus by refining the Cloud Insights value proposition and sales motion, accelerating the integration of Spot and CloudCheckr into a single FinOps suite, and driving the successful integration of Instaclustr. As I have said earlier, we now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 1% decrease year-over-year, or 4% growth in constant currency. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 22% and 23%. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is net interest income of $5 million and a share count of approximately 220 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such a dynamic environment. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&amp;A. Kris? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kris Newton, NetApp, Inc. - VP of Corporate Communications &amp; IR [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&amp;A. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is [Abdullah], speaking in for Amit. So I think your guys' cloud ARR expectation is coming down by $100 million versus prior expectations. And I just wanted to ask whether you guys could perhaps touch on the softness there. Is this more on compute, storage or analytics? And maybe if there's one cloud provider where the ramps are more challenged versus not? I would appreciate any details here. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think we expect to see the continuation of some of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is the consumption-oriented cloud offerings in our portfolio, which are cloud storage services were most impacted by customers wanting to reduce their spending. It could involve either them reducing the amount of capacity they use on our offerings or us proactively helping them migrate some of their workloads from a high-performance tier to a more cost-effective tier, so that they will continue to see value and benefit with us. That's one. Second, we saw in Q2 some project-based workloads, for example, large-scale semiconductor design that came to its natural conclusion. We anticipate some of those workloads coming back in the early part of next calendar year, but we are being cautious about that. And then finally, with our Cloud Insights product, we have continued to work to sharpen the focus on the use case of the products. We saw some early success in terms of new customer wins, new to Cloud Insights customer wins. But we're being cautious about the future growth rate of that product until we see further evidence of success. So I think those were the 3. I did not see anything materially different between the different cloud providers. Clearly, our relationship with Microsoft is the largest of the 3, given that we've worked with them for the longest, and so they saw the biggest impact this quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Two follow-ups. George, if I just take your guidance commentary, you suggest that all-flash array revenues should show Q-over-Q and year-over-year decline in January quarter? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We don't -- we didn't guide anything specific in terms of all-flash array revenue. We have guided at the total company level. We're being cautious about our outlook given what we saw in the quarter and the continued macroeconomic environment. We are not guiding any specific product category, Mehdi. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just -- that's what I walked away with. Is that a realistic assumption for all-flash array, revenues were to decline? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kris Newton, NetApp, Inc. - VP of Corporate Communications &amp; IR [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're not guiding down to the product line, Mehdi. Sorry, that we can't help you with that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. That's fine. At least I tried. Just -- and then a follow-up to your comment about the chip design. There's obviously a product migration. They are expected to introduce new products for AI application. You also suggested that, that should help you with a rebound in the cloud data services. And I want to better understand whether your underlying assumption, do you think that product transition is going to ramp in early calendar year? Is it -- is your guide on cloud data services completely derisked given this transition? Sometimes these transitions take longer. And I'm just wondering what are the key assumptions there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think with our cloud outlook, we've been cautious to address 3 topics, right? One is consumption services on the cloud are being impacted by customers reducing spend, either by optimizing the performance level that they use or the total capacity they use in our cloud storage services. That will happen for a period of time, and then we will see build back. We don't see that yet in the outlook. I think with regard to project-based workloads, listen, there are lots of different customers with different projects. I think in this case, we saw a few large projects come off our environment. And we've been cautious about how many of those come back in terms of our outlook. It will take time for them to come back as new projects and new chip designs. We are the only option in the public cloud for semiconductor chip design technologies to be verified as a cloud service. So we expect, over time, more and more customers will use our cloud services. But that will take time. And then I think in our CloudOps portfolio, as I said, we are pleased with the work that we've done so far. There's still more work to be done. And so we're being appropriately cautious about how fast that product portfolio, especially Cloud Insights, grows in the second half of this year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Vogt, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe just a big picture question on macro and linearity and how you thought about the quarter as it progressed because obviously, you did a good job of cutting costs, managing the business to the economic backdrop. But all-flash arrays were relatively weaker in the quarter, suggesting that obviously, you probably knew early in the quarter that customers were looking for more maybe cost-conscious or cost-effective solutions. And you mentioned a lot of decisions were picked up to the CTO level or the CFO level. So can you kind of discuss what you saw as the quarter progressed from a demand perspective? Was there a pivot point? Or was it just sort of a gradual bleed as we walk through each of the months? And how did it relate to, let's say, 90 days ago when we had this conversation? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think it got progressively worse through the quarter. I think you see us being appropriately cautious in our guide as a result as well. I think that the rate increases getting compounded at a very fast clip certainly impacted customers' business confidence, and that got the range of customers that were affected with their business confidence grew through the quarter and the depth of the impact on spending grew. I don't think we saw any particularly meaningful shifts between product mix in the quarter. Hybrid flash has performed well for a few quarters now and all-flash has been, as a percentage of our total mix, has been more steady than as a growing percentage of our mix. So I think -- I don't think that our view of the product portfolio affected as much as the view of the total business opportunity available in customers. I'll let Mike add any color. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Thanks, George. So David, per George's comments, when we saw linearity in the quarter, month 1 was relatively consistent with what we've seen in, I'll call it, non-Q4 quarters. What we really saw was month 2 push into month 3. And typically, we will see, call it, mid-40% of transactions and invoices in month 3. That pushed to almost 60% this quarter. So what you saw was in the second month of the quarter really started to push into the third month. And that's what we saw, that really back-end linearity that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Vogt, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Mike. Just maybe on the currency headwinds, that incremental point or 2. I know your business is primarily denominated in dollars. But can you kind of help us understand that transition from negative 3 to negative 4 to negative 5, the U.S. dollar has weakened a bit as of late. Just kind of want to get a better understanding kind of what's under the surface there and what's kind of driving that incremental headwind from an FX perspective? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Sure, David, happy to. So the significant foreign currencies we have, like most international companies, it's euro, GBP, yen and Aussie dollar. And what we saw, again, across most of those is August and September was when the dollar was the strongest. So that's when the most significant impact hit. That stayed largely through October. Now what we saw after our quarter ended, is, hey, it got a little bit better in November. The dollar weakened a little bit. Yes, we'll see if that holds. Everything we've put in front of you, we have used FX rates as of the end of October. So if it stays a little bit better, that will be good. But making our living betting on FX rates, we're not going to try that. So we use October rates for the rest of the year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Vogt, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, that's helpful. End of the month is great. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Angela Jin, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is Angela Jin, on for Samik Chatterjee. And my first question. So I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that customer weakness was concentrated in Americas' hi-tech and service provider sectors. Can we just dive more into the dynamics of each of your customer vertical or segment?. Were there certain ones that held up better, enterprise versus SMB, for example? And what types of specific behaviors or patterns that you see in each vertical? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We don't have any specific vertical that is a material contribution to our revenue. Let me start there. I think the -- what we saw through the quarter was public sector did well both in the Americas and internationally. I thought that our European team performed exceptionally well to deliver a strong result in the face of increasing headwinds. And in our outlook for the international markets, we are appropriately cautious about Germany, where our team did phenomenally well in Q2, but there's just growing pressure economically. I think with regard to the North American market, the midsized enterprise segment team did a good job. We saw good results there. We're cautious about the potential in that segment given their historic vulnerability to recession and macro exposure, but our team did well in Q2. I think the larger enterprise in those specific verticals were the ones where we saw the most substantive change in spending, and we expect them to be cautious go forward. Last year -- from a year-on-year compare, last year, public -- the hi-tech and service provider and the large enterprise segment did well for us. So this is a year-on-year compare as well that we are working through. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Angela Jin, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. And then for my follow-up, with the cloud ARR target lowered to $700 million, looking ahead to the out year, I'm not asking for you to predict how deep or long a potential downturn could be. But how are you thinking about risk to that $2 billion cloud ARR target by fiscal year '26? And what gives you confidence that you can accelerate ARR in those out years? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Angela, it's Mike. So as we both talked about, look, we still feel really good about the cloud business, both cloud storage and CloudOps. We have some things to work through this year. So even though Q2 was not where we would like, we still feel really good about the future. We will update our views of fiscal '24 and the $2 billion when we give you guidance for next year. So we'll ask you to wait until we update our fiscal '24 numbers in a couple of quarters. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think where we are focused on at the moment with our cloud business is to make sure that we are a good partner to our customers so that we can optimize their spend where they need help doing that. We are going to be continuing to accelerate our focus on selling more of our cloud products to our installed base where today it's about 15% of our Hybrid Cloud customers have our cloud products. And we have grown the number of cloud customers and the number of them that are buying more than one cloud service. So there's lots of opportunity ahead. We're focused on blocking and tackling and executing on the opportunities in front of us. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have 2 of them. I'll ask both of them upfront to either George or Mike. Thanks for the color on the cloud customer scenario. I'm kind of curious, like one of your competitors just 2 weeks ago mentioned the storage demand is still pretty strong from cloud customers. I'm kind of curious, is the weakness you're seeing NetApp customer specific? Or is there any kind of share loss due to competitive threats? That's the first question. And then the follow-up is on the cloud ARR from $800 million to $700 million, yet we spoke about a high retention rate. So is the challenge now signing new customers with ANF? Is it the ramp of AWS FSx? Any color there would be helpful on the ARR cut. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think with regard to what we saw in the quarter was really we have unique cloud services, which are native, first-party cloud services. Those are consumption offerings that we give customers. They were the ones most impacted. None of our competitors have native, first-party consumption cloud services. They offer it through the marketplace. The marketplace business for us stayed relatively consistent. And so that is what you would expect. The subscription business is less susceptible to near-term changes in usage than the consumption business. And so the benefits of consumption being you can turn it on and off also shows up when customers want to optimize spend. We want to be a good partner to the customers that want to do that. And so we are working with our hyperscaler partners to give them access to more options to be more cost-effective with their spend. Spot, which is the compute optimization platform, actually did well in the quarter. So while the storage consumption was impacted by spend, as I noted in my remarks, Spot was a -- which is a vehicle to optimize computing spend, did very well in the quarter. And so we continue to help our customers through that journey. With regard to growth opportunities, listen, as I said, we felt very good about the number of customer adds. We felt very good about the amount of cross-selling. We are starting to see dollar-based net retention rate has been strong. And so several good things in our cloud business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And on the ARR side? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So on the ARR point. So there's been a couple of questions about the $800 million down to the $700 million. So when we looked at that, originally, when we had given the $800 million, we expect it to be, call it, somewhere around $650 million as of the end of Q2. Taking a look at the second half now, we expect to grow about $100 million. That's all organic because we don't have any acquisitions baked in. And we expect that to continue to grow across cloud storage, specifically ANF, FSx and GCP, we all expect to see some good growth. We have tried to be conservative, or cautious, I will say, around the consumption business because we do expect that to come back in the second half. We're just not really sure if it's going to be Q3 or Q4. So we feel really good about the $700 million, still a significant growth in that business. But stepping it down a little bit based on the Q2 results and also take a step back a little bit on Cloud Insights. So that's the -- and I'll call it, Krish, the product view of the rest of the year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shek Ming Ho, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director &amp; Senior Analyst [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe a couple more on the public cloud side. So on the reported quarter, your public cloud revenue on an annualized basis was lower than your ARR exiting last quarter. Is it fair to say that there were some cancellations and maybe some restructuring of some of the deals based on the 3 dynamics that you guys talked about earlier? And if so, how do you feel comfortable about the future ARR would not be reduced from the churn level? And maybe I'll just throw in the next question here. If you look at your revised ARR for the $700 million, if I exclude the inorganic growth and then make some certain assumptions about dollar-based net retention, you still need quite a bit of ARR coming from new customers. So in terms of new customers, which offerings are you seeing the most traction at this point? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sidney, it's Mike. So let me do the first one. So great question. So we finished Q1 at $584 million in ARR. If you simply take -- divide that by 4, you get about $146 million that you'd expect to recognize in revenue. The revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million. And the nuance here is that, typically, you can make -- you can do that calculation. It's going to flow very nicely because of the things that we talked about in terms of some of the consumption being reduced during the quarter, some of the project-based initiatives, especially the larger chip design wins. Those happened during the quarter. Thus, we did lose some revenue that was in the ARR as of the beginning of the quarter. So that's the nuance. We don't expect to see that happen in the future. It's a great question, but it was largely due to that. The third part is the back-ended linearity on some of the subscription business that follows the NetApp, I'll call it, core business as well. So it's really those 3 things attributed to that revenue coming in lower than simply taking the ARR divided by 4. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shek Ming Ho, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director &amp; Senior Analyst [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And in terms of the new customers -- ARR from new customers? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Listen, we had a good quarter in terms of new customer additions. We have 2 major vehicles for new customer additions. The first being the native cloud services that we help our cloud provider partners, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, sell for us. Those continue to be good vehicles for new customer additions. And then Spot has continued to be a strong vehicle for new customer additions. So I feel good about the pace of net new customers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- W. Chiu, Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is Victor Chiu, in for Simon Leopold. You noted several customers that concluded several large projects and then drove capacity reductions. Can you help clarify what changed versus your expectations exactly because the way that you kind of described, the conclusions were kind of natural and then so we assumed it would have been somewhat expected. So either did they conclude earlier? I think you mentioned there was some chip design kind of timing-related issues. Can you just help us clarify why this dynamic was not expected? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Listen, I think we have seen in the past projects get concluded in a quarter and other projects get started up within the same quarter or by other customers within the quarter. This time, we saw some particularly large projects that concluded in the quarter where the start of the next project is beyond the finish of the quarter and further out than we would like. So I think that was the nature of what happened in the quarter. I think we would, honestly, want to get better visibility. We're working on that. I think this is when we have another partner selling the service to the end customer. Our sales teams are working to get better visibility into the end customers kind of priorities and spending time lines. So that's on us. We can do better on that, and I acknowledge that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- W. Chiu, Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just quickly, regarding your commentary on macro headwinds, are you observing explicit behavioral trends? Or are you having explicit discussions with customers that makes you confident that the slowing is specific to the macro environment versus a more secular shift like accelerating workload migrations to the public cloud? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think we are closely engaged with a large number of the enterprise customers through our direct sales force. In the midsized enterprise market, as you know, we go to market with the channel providers. In terms of the customer behavior we saw in the quarter, it is very reflective of a typical macro cycle, more approvals for deals, smaller deal sizes, projects being broken up into phases rather than one large purchase, and some deals moving out of the quarter. That did not mean that other customers did not start projects with us and move them forward. We know that those projects are -- that we did not lose share to somebody else because we are in ongoing dialogue around the other phases of the projects that are yet to come online. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Meta A. Marshall, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - VP [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just wanted to get a sense of whether we could get -- just what the size of hi-tech and service provider is as a percentage of the cloud revenue or just kind of any vertical concentration that we should be mindful of. And then maybe last quarter, you had given kind of the storage services as a percentage of cloud ARR. If we could just have an update there, that would be helpful as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Listen, Meta, we're not going to break out specific verticals. I would just say that we saw a broad-based -- hi-tech is quite a broad segment, and we saw a fairly conservative posture across that segment. Service provider could -- is also broadly defined. It could be telco. It could be hosting provider. It could be some form of cloud providers. So these are broader categories than a very specific definition. And then we saw fairly conservative postures across most of those customers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Meta, it's Mike. On your second question, so 2 data points for you. Cloud storage continues to be almost exactly 60% of the total, and that includes, as of the end of Q2, Instaclustr and CloudCheckr, which are in CloudOps. So there you see the great growth we've seen in cloud storage because overall, as a total number, it stayed right around 60%. The other important number is we've talked about consumption versus subscription. As of the end of Q2, it's pretty close to 50-50 a little bit, a couple of percentage points higher for consumption. We do expect by the end of the year with that $700 million for that to get much closer to 60% because that's where we expect the growth across ANF, GCP and FSx, those products as well. So those are the 2 data points we gave you that break down that cloud ARR number. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ananda Prosad Baruah, Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division - MD [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Two clarifications, if I could. Mike, just the remarks you made a couple of times in the prepared comments about, and this is really the clarification, FX driving sort of some portion of the guide down or whatever that context was. Could you clarify that? And then I have a quick follow-up clarification as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure, Ananda, happy to. So that was in reference to on the Q1 call, we had given -- this is directly related to EPS. We've given $5.50 as the midpoint. Since that time, because of the continued strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the FX situation, the $5.40 is actually above what that number would have been on an FX-adjusted basis, that's about $5.37. The point there being, hey, we're seeing even in the second half with the lower outlook around revenue, we're doing all we can around costs and other efficiencies to ensure that we continue to still drive that EPS number consistent with the number we gave you last time on the call. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ananda Prosad Baruah, Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division - MD [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I got it. That's super helpful. And then the second clarification is. To one of the questions, you mentioned -- you gave some context around timing of pickup and something along -- well, it was sort of -- that was sort of the gist of it. But I think, Mike, the comments you made where you expect demand to come back in the second half, though you weren't sure if it was Q3 or Q4. Could you clarify that? And is it fiscal Q3, Q4? Or is it calendar '23 Q3, Q4, in addition to the clarification? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. So I've been saying -- and I only talk about fiscal years, not calendar years. So this was second half fiscal, and that was directly related to the cloud ARR growth. So we finished at $603 million. We've guided end of year to $700 million. We are not going to guide Q3. We feel good about the second half because again, these are some of those -- these are large project-based as well as consumption. When does that flow in? Is it in our fiscal Q3 or Q4? We feel confident about the second half. There's a little bit of nuance around whether it's 3 or 4, hence, we're only doing the end of the year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ananda Prosad Baruah, Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division - MD [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's super helpful. And so was that the same, like, that anecdotally, you guys are experiencing, and George, feel free to jump in on this too, anecdotally, you guys are -- you're experiencing a little bit of a sideways here, call it, a pause. You anticipate that it's going to last, I guess, like a max -- it's a period of max 6 months -- 8 months. Let's say, started slowing mid-quarter, could last an additional 6 months. But you do expect sort of a, then, pickup in some context after that? Anecdotally, is that sort of the gist of what you guys are communicating? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [49] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, keep in mind, Ananda, all this is related to the cloud ARR. This is not the Hybrid Cloud. And this is more of just us talking about when we expect it to come back in the second half. And again, because of the large project base. That's really the nuance on this more than anything versus us calling, ""Hey, we expect to see things pick up after April."" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [50] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- James Dickey Suva, Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Research Analyst [51] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George, on your outlook and Mike, on your outlook, you mentioned about slowing economic comments, which is understood. Any thoughts around inventory digestion? Is there a sense that there's inventory digestion out there? And if so, how long or any double ordering? Or is it just purely kind of economic pausing and elongation of cycles? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [52] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We did not see any order cancellations or any of those things. As we have mentioned repeatedly, we have good line of sight into our customers' spending priorities and behaviors and are directly engaged with the largest of them. I think as we saw in this quarter, and we continue to be cautious about looking at the second half of the year. These are clearly related to IT budget revisions, right, where they are reducing deal sizes or scrutinizing projects and things. They will defer a portion of that project to a subsequent quarter or a subsequent part of the calendar year. So we have good visibility into the activities in our customers, and we did not see cancellations of orders because of prior orders or double ordering. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- James Dickey Suva, Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Research Analyst [53] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. But on the inventory digestion, any thoughts of -- were there any inventory that's still being digested that may allow corporates or service providers to prolong these revisions? Or is any concern about inventory out there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [54] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Typically, during macro situations like these, we have seen customers sweat their assets, right? And so -- what we mean by that is they will drive a system to a higher level of utilization and so that they can defer either capacity augmentation or system upgrades for a period of time. Now that's not forever, right? Storage is consumed because data keeps growing. And so there's always that trade-off. We certainly see some of that behavior going on. Jim, I think, certainly in our service provider segment, we see that. And in some of the hi-tech verticals, we saw that as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [55] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dong Wang, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [56] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's actually George Wang, on for Tim Long. I have 2 questions. Firstly, George, maybe you can elaborate on the current state of deal integration in terms of Spot, Instaclustr. And any thought process behind the polling deal until FY '24? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [57] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Listen, we have a good portfolio of technologies already. And what we are really focused on is sharpening the use cases that are best suited to the current macro environment and making those use cases easy for the customers to adopt, expand and renew, right? And that operational focus is our highest priority. There are some -- there's work to be done to integrate the CloudCheckr capabilities into the Spot suite so that it becomes one broader offering rather than 2 parallel offerings. We have made good progress along the way, but there's more work to be done. In Instaclustr, there are 2 unique value adds that we bring. One is the integration of our cloud storage services and Spot services into Instaclustr. And the second is the fact that it is a truly open source data services platform. We have the first of those 2 being worked. And so we feel like there's a lot of value we already have in our portfolio. There's work to be completed, and we want to keep our teams focused on that work on the technology side. On the go-to-market side, we also have more broad enablement and training for our sales teams to be able to position Spot and Instaclustr and CloudCheckr into the account. So we feel good about the work we're doing. We got to finish it before we look at other things. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dong Wang, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [58] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Cool. Yes, a quick follow-up is on the cost cuts. Maybe you can elaborate on the kind of, disaggregate just components for the cost cuts, whether that's sales and marketing, the SG&amp;A or kind of some of the R&amp;D. Any color would be appreciated. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [59] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George, it's Mike. And just I want to make sure your question was the -- what are we looking at for cost reductions in the second half? Was that the question? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dong Wang, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [60] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [61] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Perfect. Thank you. So there's several that I think you're going to see flow through the P&amp;L. I'm going to start all the way at the top, which is we do expect to finally see some relief from our significant expenditures related to premiums. The supply chain is getting a little bit better. It gets better every day. So that's going to help the second half. In addition, NAND pricing will help us as well. Now we do have a little bit of inventory to work through. And you'll see that still in Q3, but we expect by Q4, you'll see that as well. On the OpEx side, we're -- George talked about we've already done a headcount freeze. We're taking a look at all discretionary spending, including travel, programs, outside services, just like everybody else who has embraced the hybrid work environment. We'll take a hard look at our facilities costs as well. So we've already started down the path on several of those as I talked about, hey, we'll continue to look at those as we go into the second half. So there's numerous areas for us to focus on. In addition, keep in mind, too, that in OpEx, there's a good bit of that cost structure related to incentive comp and commissions. And certainly, those will come down in the second half as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [62] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nehal Sushil Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst [63] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So -- the total revenue guidance is lowered by 400 basis points at current prices, 100 basis points due to incremental FX, another 100 basis points due to lower PCF ARR target, and then the remaining 200 basis points either due to weaker billings results on a constant currency basis during the quarter? Or is it a weaker billings result that has started to transpire during the third quarter, again, on a constant currency basis? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [64] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So for the second half, Nehal, that is mostly related to product revenue, which would be largely booked and recognized in the quarter. So it's -- there's -- backlog is largely at the normal rates, the seasonal normal rates that we would expect. So that is going to be systems in the second half, I think, is the third part of your question. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nehal Sushil Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst [65] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Excellent. Okay. And then dollar-based net revenue retention rate declined quite significantly, 192 to 140. Is this largely because of the project-related stuff? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [66] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollar-based net revenue retention was 150 last quarter, and it's now 140. So step down as the base of customers expand, and we did see some churn in our consumption business, as we noted on our call, so we don't see that as materially different than what we would expect. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [67] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And to George's point, Nehal, we've been calling that for several quarters, which is, as that ARR number gets bigger, that dollar-based net retention percentage will come down. We like to call it the 120, 130, where we think it will land, but we have been calling that percentage to continue to decline as that number increases. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nehal Sushil Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst [68] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That you have. Okay. And then just finally, Mike, the PCF GM did come down both Q-on-Q and year-over-year. Why is that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [69] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The PCF gross margin came down because of the revenue scale relative to the infrastructure that we have deployed. Note that the consumption business, some elements of those are based on our deployed systems, right, in the cloud provider environments. And when they have less scale, you see -- less utilization, you see less gross margin. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [70] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. It came down from 69.7% to 68.3%, so down slightly. And to George's point, that's largely due to scale. We continue to feel good, as I mentioned in my notes, about the 75% to 80% as we drive that scale. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [71] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wamsi Mohan, BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in Americas Equity Research [72] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I appreciate the fiscal year guide. But George, you were talking earlier about IT budgets and some caution around that. I was wondering if you could share some color on what you're hearing from customers more around calendar '23 IT budgets. And what's your view on how you expect the storage market to grow in '23 and your growth relative to that? And I have a follow-up. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [73] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think with regard to '23, we're being cautious. We aren't guiding next fiscal year, but we are being cautious about the start to calendar year '23. We have seen, typically, these macro situations that new budget outlays to start a calendar year probably take longer than typical. So we've been cautious about the start of the new calendar year. With regard to the storage market overall, I think it's going to be paced by new workload deployments. I think there will be customers that will be forced to upgrade systems because their existing systems are coming to either end of useful life or end of they're just out of capacity or performance. But I think the majority will prioritize new workload deployments and/or system consolidation for cost and energy benefit use cases. We continue to see -- while the cloud migrations are slowing down a bit, we continue to see that as a long-term trend that customers are going to take on for a whole bunch of reasons. And so I think cloud will outpace on-prem in the broader market. And in the on-prem world, we see NAND helping flash be a bigger part of the mix going forward. Our capacity flash products had a good quarter. Our hybrid flash products had a good quarter. They are typical about where customers are cost conscious. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wamsi Mohan, BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in Americas Equity Research [74] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. That's helpful, George. And just a follow-up on your last comment about the NAND market. Every few years, you see the significant dislocation in pricing and this one is quite severe. You guys noted the benefit that you will recognize in gross margin terms. But can you just remind us on how you're thinking about the impact to revenues based on the NAND price decline? Are you expecting a deceleration in AFA revenues? Or are you expecting elasticity of demand to offset that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [75] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Customers' budget in dollars, the current macro environment has them spending less dollars, but they'll probably shift the mix to AFAs, if there's more value in the offering, right? So we see them budget in dollars, Wamsi. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wamsi Mohan, BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in Americas Equity Research [76] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. But in aggregate terms, would you say that the customer budgets would be up or down, like in full, in aggregate, whether it's cloud, on-prem, all put together? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [77] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think overall, year-on-year, I think '23, we expect to be moderated and down relative to '22, certainly at the start of the year. '22 had a good start to the year. And so our start of the new calendar year, which is baked into our outlook for the second half of fiscal year, we think people are going to be more cautious overall, Wamsi. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [78] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shannon Siemsen Cross, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [79] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I was just wondering what you're hearing from customers on your Keystone offering. I think as a service offering, they're becoming a bit more attractive in an economic downturn. So I'm wondering what kind of traction you're seeing there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [80] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's early, but good traction. We are focused with a few channel partners who are enabled on selling Keystone. We've had good customer wins, good momentum in terms of our offerings. We brought new innovation to market in the last quarter, both a unified control plane so that you can use either a Keystone-based consumption offering in your environment or our public cloud offerings, and you can move workloads and licenses across those. So a good amount of innovation. And you're correct, we'll continue to see opportunities to help customers around whatever their kind of buying model is in this environment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shannon Siemsen Cross, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [81] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great, and thanks. And Mike, look forward to seeing you on Thursday at our conference. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael J. Berry, NetApp, Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [82] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I as well. Look forward to seeing you on Thursday. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [83] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our final question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kyle P. McNealy, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [84] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You touched on this a bit earlier, but not directly. But does the budget scrutiny that you're seeing right now from some subset of customers impact their decisions for provisioning the mix that they're provisioning of all-flash versus hybrid arrays at least for new projects. And I know you mentioned that your all-flash portfolio has leading cost efficiency, but do you expect the mindset to change on how much customers are willing to embrace more all-flash? Will the pockets of slowdown that you're seeing potentially pull everything back and the mix stays relatively on the same trajectory? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [85] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think -- thank you for the question. We didn't see customers sort of reevaluating technical decisions about what type of infrastructure to buy. I think they allowed the technical team to choose what was the most value, and they make decisions based on the relative cost effectiveness of disk versus flash, right? I think what we saw was an approval level going up for the same deal what would have been approved by a director, now got taken up to a VP, what was approved by a VP, probably goes up to a CTO. That is what elongated deal cycles in the quarter and/or people shrinking how much they wanted to buy at one time and phasing projects into multiple phases. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kris Newton, NetApp, Inc. - VP of Corporate Communications &amp; IR [86] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All right. Thanks, Kyle. I'm going to give it back to George for a couple of closing thoughts. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Kurian, NetApp, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [87] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- While there are near-term economic challenges for every company, we know that our opportunity ahead is substantial, durable and growing. The fundamentals of our business are strong and the value we bring customers is undeniable. Our strategic growth opportunities all-flash arrays, cloud storage and cloud infrastructure optimization are tightly aligned to customers' top priority and represent the potential for long-term, sustained and profitable growth. We will continue to be disciplined stewards of the business, focusing on our strategic growth opportunities while continually optimizing our operating costs to drive shareholder value. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [88] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results can be found at http://investors.netapp.com.

Future Enterprise Awards 2022 winners revealed.NetApp usage of non-GAAP financial informationTo supplement NetApp’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), NetApp provides investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow, billings, and historical and projected non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. NetApp also presents the hardware and software components of our GAAP product revenues. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. The hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers, down to the level of the product hardware and software components. This allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which NetApp has historically billed customers for such respective components.NetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP earnings per share data, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.NetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.NetApp believes that the presentation of the software and hardware components of our product revenues is meaningful to investors and management as it illustrates the significance of the Company’s software and provides improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and R&amp;D investment.NetApp approximates billings by adding net revenues as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period to the change in total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the same period. Billings is a performance measure that NetApp believes provides useful information to management and investors because it approximates the amounts under purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed.NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making.NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable:A. Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.B. Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the amount can fluctuate based on variables unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period.C. Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results.D. Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or cost base and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.E. Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.F. Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.G. Gains/losses on the sale or derecognition of assets. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties and other transactions in which we transfer control of assets to a third party. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.H. Gains/losses on the sale of investments in equity securities. These are gains/losses from the sale of our investment in certain equity securities. Typically, such investments are sold as a result of a change in control of the underlying businesses. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.I. Debt extinguishment costs. NetApp excludes certain non-recurring expenses incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of debt. Management believes such nonrecurring costs do not reflect the results of its underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.J. Income tax adjustments. NetApp’s non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, statute lapses and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company’s tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges resulting from the integration of intellectual property from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful measure of the Company’s operational performance.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) share price has soared 219% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 18% in about a quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Tractor Supply While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Tractor Supply achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 26% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Tractor Supply has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Tractor Supply's TSR for the last 5 years was 242%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Tractor Supply returned a loss of 1.0% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 18%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 28% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Tractor Supply  you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.Of course Tractor Supply may not be the best stock to buy.

(""Enbridge"" or the ""Company"") and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including management's assessment of Enbridge and its subsidiaries' future plans and operations. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as ''anticipate'', ''expect'', ''project'', ''estimate'', ''forecast'', ''plan'', ''intend'', ''target'', ''believe'', ""likely"" and similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward-looking information or statements in this news release include statements with respect to the proposed CO2 pipeline transportation system and sequestration facility in the Corpus Christi, TX area, including the characteristics and benefits thereof and the anticipated supply and customer arrangements for the project.Although Enbridge believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the information available on the date such statements are made and processes used to prepare the information, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. By their nature, these statements involve a variety of assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Assumptions regarding the expected supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, renewable energy and other commodities, and the prices of these commodities, are material to and underlie all forward-looking statements, as they may impact current and future levels of demand for the Company's services. Similarly, energy transition, including the drivers and pace thereof, exchange rates, inflation and interest rates impact the economies and business environments in which the Company operates and may impact levels of demand for the Company's services and cost of inputs, and are therefore inherent in all forward-looking statements. Due to the interdependencies and correlation of these macroeconomic factors, the impact of any one assumption on a forward-looking statement cannot be determined with certainty. The most relevant assumptions associated with forward-looking statements on announced projects and projects under construction, including estimated in-service dates and the realization of anticipated benefits, include the following: the impact of litigation and government, regulatory and stakeholder actions and approvals on construction and in-service schedules; the availability and price of labour and construction materials; the effects of inflation and foreign exchange rates on labour and material costs; the effects of interest rates on borrowing costs; technology-related matters; the impact of weather; and expectations about our partners' ability to complete and finance proposed projects.Enbridge's forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those risks and uncertainties discussed in this news release and in the Company's other filings with Canadian and United States securities regulators. The impact of any one risk, uncertainty or factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as these are interdependent and Enbridge's future course of action depends on management's assessment of all information available at the relevant time. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Enbridge assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made in this news release or otherwise, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Words, and variations of words, such as ""anticipate,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""may,"" ""expect,"" ""plan,"" ""develop,"" ""explore"" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes are generally indicative of forward-looking statements.

The reason is that premium credit cards have an annual fee, and only some have room for these fees in their budget. The welcome bonuses sometimes more than offset the annual fee, but premium credit cards won’t be worth it for everyone after the first year. That said, here are the top eight offers out there right now.Premium Credit CardsAs mentioned, premium credit cards often have some of the best welcome bonuses in the credit card industry. Their annual fees can also be high, as can their minimum spend to receive the bonus. However, they have the most lucrative welcome bonuses. Take a look.American Express Platinum CardWelcome bonus: 100,000 points after spending $6,000 in the first six monthsThe American Express Platinum Card offers one of the best welcome bonuses if you are a big spender. You can earn 100,000 bonus points after you spend $6,000 within the first six months of account opening.

And currently, the Gold Card’s welcome bonus is 75,000 points — just 25% less than the bonus on the Platinum Card.Story continuesWelcome bonus: 60,000 points after spending $4,000 in the first three monthsThe Chase Sapphire Preferred has a welcome bonus of 60,000 points after you spend $4,000 within the first three months of account opening. Chase says those points are worth $750 when you redeem them through the Chase travel portal. (Note: transferring to travel partners is also an option.)

Like the previous two cards, the Venture Rewards has just a $95 annual fee. This is a great card for everyday spending as it earns unlimited 2x points on every purchase. It also earns 5x miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.No-Annual-Fee Credit CardsYou still have options if you want a lucrative welcome bonus but don’t want to pay an annual fee. These no-annual-fee credit cards still have great welcome bonuses. Plus, their spending requirements are usually (but not always) lower than the premium cards mentioned above.

Chase has also introduced a unique benefit for its no-annual-fee cards, allowing you to earn 5% cash back on grocery store purchases of up to $12,000 in the first year. These two perks are worth up to $800 in total.Chase IHG Rewards Traveler CardWelcome bonus: 80,000 points after spending $2,000 in the first three monthsThe Chase IHG Rewards Traveler Card has a bonus of 80,000 points after you spend $2,000 within the first three months of account opening. Those numbers would normally put a credit card in the premium category, but this card has no annual fee. This card is a no-brainer for those who travel often and prefer IHG hotel brands (Holiday Inn, InterContinnental, Staybridge Suites, etc.).Capital One VentureOne Rewards CardWelcome bonus: 20,000 miles after spending $500 in the first three monthsThe Capital One VentureOne Rewards card gives you 20,000 miles after you spend $500 in the first three months of account opening.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now. As per Goldman Sachs, the stock market will experience relatively less pain next year compared to 2022 but there will be no gains, as enterprises post slow earnings growth through the rest of 2023. Assuming the Federal Reserve can manage a soft landing, Wall Street analysts forecast that earnings per share in the S&amp;P 500 would be flat at $224 in 2023, and the index would drop by 2% to 3,900 over the next six months. However, a hard economic landing is entirely possible, with analysts expecting that earnings per share would decline 11% to $200 in that scenario, and the S&amp;P 500 would plummet 21% to 3150. In an economic backdrop consisting of slow growth, reduced inflation, and new monetary policies, Morgan Stanley predicts that 2023 will bring upside for bonds, defensive equities, and emerging markets. Andrew Sheets, Chief Cross-Asset Strategist for Morgan Stanley Research, said on November 22: “For markets, this presents a very different backdrop than 2022, which was marked by resilient growth, high inflation and hawkish policy. Overall, 2023 will be a good year for income investing.”People who are just starting out their investment journeys are often unsure where to put their money in such a volatile environment. Some of the best beginner stocks to monitor include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Our Methodology The best stocks for beginner investors are usually safer stocks that pay dividends so that these investors aren't discouraged by large losses that are experienced more frequently by smaller-cap risky stocks that also offer potentially higher returns. Every investor's dream is to uncover safe stocks that can deliver large returns. At Insider Monkey we focus on the stocks that are favored by hedge funds and our monthly newsletter's stock picks managed to outperform the S&amp;P 500 Index funds by 74 percentage points over the last 5.5 years. Beginner investors can subscribe to our free daily newsletter to read about some of the stocks hedge funds are piling into.Story continuesFor this article we selected stocks which are defensive in nature, offer strong market visibility, can thrive in the rising rates environment, have resilient dividend profiles, and display a longstanding history of surviving turbulent market environments. We have also considered some stocks priced under $100 for beginner investors with limited money. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. 14 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashBest Beginner Stocks to Buy Now 14. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is an Illinois-based company that procures, transports, processes, and commercializes agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients in the United States, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and internationally. On November 2, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 7, to shareholders of record on November 16. Baird analyst Ben Kallo on October 26 raised the price target on Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) to $98 from $94 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he remains a buyer as underlying demand continues to be resilient while Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) navigates a mixed supply chain and exchange rate environment. He also said management continues to add value to shareholders through share repurchases and strategic M&amp;A, setting up a robust long-term outlook.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 37 hedge funds were bullish on Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.4 million shares worth $117.7 million. Like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is one of the best stocks for a beginner investment portfolio. Here is what Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund has to say about Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”13. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), the British energy and petrochemical company, is one of the best beginner stocks to invest in. On November 28, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced that it has agreed to acquire Danish biogas producer Nature Energy Biogas from Davidson Kempner Capital Management for approximately $2 billion. After acquiring Europe's biggest producer of renewable natural gas, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) will expand its established customer base across several sectors and boost its transition to net-zero emissions.On November 11, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd raised the price target on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) to $71 from $65 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The Q3 results were incrementally bullish for the integrated oil 2023 macro outlook, the analyst wrote in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was part of 39 public stock portfolios at the end of September 2022, and Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 20.7 million shares worth $1 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a New York-based financial holding company that provides financial products and services to enterprises, governments, financial institutions, and individuals in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. On November 9, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ventured back into the global exchange traded fund marketplace with the launch of the Innovator Equity Managed Floor ETF (NYSE:SFLR). SFLR is a new fund that offers a 0.89% expense ratio, 256 portfolio holdings, and seeks to provide actively managed floors that attempt to limit losses to 10% each year.On October 17, Citi analyst Keith Horowitz maintained a Buy recommendation on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $90 from $97. The bank had a ""slight miss"" in Q3 2022 as the business model works best in upward trending markets, but posting a 15% ROTCE in tight market conditions ""speaks to the durability of the revenue stream,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 52 hedge funds were bullish on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 58 funds in the last quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 12.6 million shares worth $996.4 million. Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)11. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), the American coffee giant, is one of the best stocks for beginners to invest in. On November 4, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported a FQ4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 and a revenue of $8.41 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $90 million, respectively. Comparable store sales climbed 7% globally, with sales increasing 11% in the U.S. and double digits internationally, excluding China.On November 4, Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer raised the price target on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) to $97 from $95 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares, telling investors that he is ""less worried"" about FY23 sales and earnings after the company's FQ4 results. He lifted his FY23 EPS estimate to $3.39 from $3.25, which now reflects U.S. same-store sales growth of 8.5%, up from 7.5%.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 54 funds reported owning stakes worth $2.26 billion in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 55 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.4 billion. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the leading stakeholders of the company, with approximately 3 million shares valued at $252.5 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Same Store sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the most stable and resilient dividend stocks to monitor, with a history of consistently increasing payouts for 60 years. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the top stocks for beginners to consider for a safe portfolio. On October 20, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also posted market-beating Q3 results. UBS analyst Peter Grom raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $68 from $63 and kept a Buy rating on the shares on October 26. The company's Q3 earnings beat was ""impressive"" as its organic growth sufficiently offset the currency headwinds, the analyst told investors. According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 59 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 60 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $22.40 billion. Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) sold off with consumer staples even as the company reported strong pricing for the second quarter. On average, product prices rose with management hinting at further momentum.”9. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based financial institution that operates through four segments – Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer &amp; Wealth Management. On October 18, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) reported a Q3 GAAP EPS of $8.25 and a revenue of $11.98 billion, topping analysts’ estimates by $0.57 and $450 million, respectively. On October 19, BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham maintained an Outperform rating on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $469 from $470 after its Q3 results. The company should be able to maintain a mid-teens RoTCE in the medium term on the back of ongoing tailwinds from share gains in core Global Banking and Markets, along with improved profitability from higher growth adjacencies of Transaction Banking and Consumer businesses, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 69 hedge funds held bullish positions in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), with combined stakes worth $4.5 billion. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is one of the largest stakeholders of the company, with 2.20 million shares valued at $647.3 million. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers' names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look at how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)8. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Next on our list of the best beginner stocks is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), an American general merchandise retailer. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an appropriate investment for beginners given its defensive nature, strong financials, and robust dividend. On November 28, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $578 from $581. The analyst told investors to stick with the ""winners"" in retail.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 69 hedge funds were bullish on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 64 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.10 million shares worth $521.7 million. Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”7. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based company that generates, transmits, and distributes electric power to retail and wholesale customers in North America.

The dividend is payable on December 15, to shareholders of record on November 25. On October 24, Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza maintained a Buy rating on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $99 from $108. The analyst updated select estimates ahead of Q3 earnings season from the Power and Utilities group to reflect ""known and measurable year-over-year items,"" to adjust for seasonality, and to re-mark to the latest commodity curves. According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 73 hedge funds were long NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), up from 59 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2 million shares worth $157 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”6. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), an American holding company engaged in the insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses, is one of the best stocks that beginners should closely monitor. Although Berkshire does not pay a dividend, it is managed by legendary financier Warren Buffett, who is known to lead profitable businesses despite turbulent economic environments. In Q3 2022, the company reported financials that outperformed market estimates.  In mid-October, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) announced that it has received all regulatory approvals needed for the proposed acquisition of Alleghany for a total equity value of nearly $11.60 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 104 hedge funds were bullish on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 109 funds in the last quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 30 million shares worth about $8 billion. In addition to PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the top stocks favored by elite hedge funds. Here is what Black Bear Value Fund has to say about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Going forward I expect Berkshire to compound at above average returns from this price. BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Gas Stocks To Buy10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Best Digital Payments Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 14 Best Beginner Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and The Progressive (PGR). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (-1.6% vs. -3.1%) as well as the S&amp;P 500 index (-1.6% vs. -16.4%). This performance momentum has been underpinned by a history of outperformance, with the recent strong Q3 report the 10th straight quarter of better-than-expected top and bottom line results.

If you want to read about some more consumer stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider.Consumer stocks are generally considered one of the safest investments at the stock market because of their predictable business models and relatively lower price volatility as compared to other sectors of the economy. Some examples of consumer industries include food and beverage producers, household item manufacturers, personal care product manufacturers, and tobacco companies. The consumer industry is also highly consolidated in nature, a key driver of demand for the sector in a volatile macro environment. Some of the top firms in this space are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). In the past few months, even as inflation impacts the short-term spending trends, there is a belief among experts that this sentiment might weigh on manufacturing stocks longer than expected. However, the long-term growth indicators for the industry remain overwhelmingly positive, making the sector a top retirement stock portfolio pick.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the consumer sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Consumer Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider11. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35  Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) operates as a food company worldwide. It is one of the best safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. It operates through four segments: Beef, Pork, Chicken, and Prepared Foods. On October 5, Tyson Foods noted that it is bringing all corporate teams to its headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. On November 3, Tyson Foods announced a partnership agreement with Tanmiah Food Co., producer and supplier of poultry and other meat products, to invest in the poultry capacity of Supreme Foods Processing Co. Story continuesThe firm has paid a dividend to shareholders for more than three decades. In the past ten years, this payout has registered consistent growth. On October 27, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery maintained a Neutral rating on Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stock and lowered the price target to $68 from $79, noting that the consumer demand in an inflationary environment remains at risk and falling prices will affect the firm’s chicken and beef segments.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 35 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.1 billion in Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), compared to 37 in the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion. Just like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is one of the safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. 10. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52  Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates as a general merchandise retailer in the United States. It is one of the top safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 26, Target Corporation revealed an expanded collaboration with Apple which includes a threefold increase in Apple at Target locations. The company said that it is offering the members of its loyalty program access to a four-month free trial of Apple Fitness+ with no purchase required. Target Corp has a dividend history stretching back more than fifty years. On August 18, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli maintained a Hold rating on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock and raised the price target to $165 from $150, noting that the company’s second quarter sales were in-line, but its earnings were still below the twice-revised forecast amid heavily marked down inventory clearing activity.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 52 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2 billion in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $1.3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat-footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters (…read more)9. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55      The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) operates as an off-price apparel and home fashion retailer. It is one of the elite safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 26, TJX Companies confirmed to News Center 5 that it is no longer selling the merchandise of rapper and fashion designer, formerly known as Kanye West, because of antisemitic comments. The firm is slowly trying to build a dividend profile.On October 25, Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger maintained an Overweight rating on The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) stock and raised the price target to $80 from $77, noting that the off-price retailers’ operating margins are below pre-Covid levels because of the volatile retail operating environment. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm BlueSpruce Investments is a leading shareholder in The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) with 5.4 million shares worth more than $332.3 million.  In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the U.S. and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes.”8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. It is one of the premier safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 7, Coca-Cola India declared a partnership with Xepto, a grocery delivery service, for a return and recycle initiative for PET bottles. The companies seek to establish an organized process of collection for PET bottles with 100 per cent traceability.  Coca-Cola is one of the most famous dividend stocks on the US market with a nearly six-decade old payout history. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third quarter beat expectations.   At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 59 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $25 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 60 in the preceding quarter worth $28.4 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61  Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) operates as a home improvement retailer in the United States and internationally.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potentialSupportive macroeconomic backdropPositioned to grow EPS largely independent of market conditionsIdiosyncratic revenue opportunities driving share gains Self-help initiatives catalyzing operating margin expansionBuybacks representing ~8% of current market capitalization planned for 2022 (…read more)6.

All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including several entry positions to $15 an hour.

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-waste-management-120031487.html,1669809631,STORY,['WM'],"[Does the November share price for Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Waste Management The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.95bUS$2.69bUS$2.90bUS$3.13bUS$3.31bUS$3.45bUS$3.58bUS$3.70bUS$3.80bUS$3.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x10Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.58%Est @ 4.5%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$1.8kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$80bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$80b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$41bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$63b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$165, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.972. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Waste Management, we've put together three fundamental elements you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong first quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to feel bullish about our momentum and execution across small business and tax. We're innovating at a high velocity using the power of our platform and modern technology capabilities to deliver new offerings at scale focusing on breakthrough adoption. We continue to be focused on putting more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. This is more important than ever in the current uncertain economic environment and helps us penetrate our large total addressable market of over $300 billion. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Revenue grew 29%, including 13 points from the addition of Mailchimp. Total revenue growth was fueled by the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 38% or 19% excluding Mailchimp and 25% revenue growth in the Consumer Group driven by a strong October peak with new customers and extension filers. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see charge volume growth, the number of employees paid, the hours worked per small business and cash reserves. These measures remain strong for those on our platform and inform our perspective on the health of small businesses. TurboTax had a robust finish to the tax season with a record number of innovations launched and tested in the October peak. I'm excited about this coming -- upcoming season, particularly our strategy to transform the assisted category, including the launch of Business Tax and TurboTax and Credit Karma platform integrations. Now turning to Credit Karma. At Investor Day and on our fourth quarter call earnings call, we shared that all Credit Karma verticals had been negatively impacted by the macro uncertainty. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into November, we saw further deterioration in all verticals. Consumer default rates remain relatively low by historical standards, reflecting strong consumer cash balances coming out of the pandemic. However, we continue to see partners pull back from extending credit, reflecting the uncertainty in the economic environment and the risk of deterioration in credit performance. Given this context, Credit Karma revenue came in lower than expected for the quarter. We are lowering our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for Credit Karma to a decline of 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 10% to 15% growth. At the same time, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for all other segments and reiterating our fiscal 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance. Our ability to maintain earnings power despite the lower Credit Karma revenue guidance shows the power of our diversified platform and our ability to balance platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our commitments. Regardless of the near-term macro volatility, we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% for Credit Karma driven by our vision and innovation to become the self-driving financial platform fueling prosperity for all consumers. At Investor Day, we shared how our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating our innovation and how our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate our success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our Big Bets. Our evolution from a siloed technology stack to a platform leveraging shared capabilities is well underway. Our development environment enables speed and innovation. Engineers now have 6x the velocity of deploying code, resulting in accelerated innovation compared to fiscal year 2020. Our AI and fintech capabilities are well positioned to solve our customers' biggest problems, such as our money innovations across payments and payroll, advancements in TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advance, just to name a few. And we're doing that today with over 730 million AI-driven customer interactions per year, 2 million AI models in production, 58 billion machine learning predictions per day and over $465 billion in money moved during fiscal year 2022. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customer face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. During the October tax peak, our team launched a record 50 innovations to test and learn. Our learnings can help us transform our go-to-market campaign for the assisted segment; revamp the end-to-end TurboTax Live platform experiences with faster access to money via Credit Karma; and better serve the investor, Latino and self-employed segments. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. With Mailchimp, we're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we launched a new brand campaign, refreshed our website, and launched an improved first-time use experience for new customers that help them more quickly find and use the feature that aligns with their unique business needs. We also launched a 1-hour assisted onboarding process for our high-value Mailchimp customers with the goal of guiding them to more advanced features to increase awareness and usage. This program was launched in a record 4 weeks by leveraging components of our virtual expert platform, another example of the power of the Intuit platform capabilities. As a result of these enhancements and others, we're seeing a positive impact on customer growth and expansion and a lift in customers converting to pay. Turning to our money portfolio. We've made a tremendous investment over the last few years to expand our suite of money offerings to help small businesses get paid, pay others and access capital and manage their money. We continue to see strength in our charge volume driven by easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront. This quarter, we made it even easier for more customers to access their cash quickly by removing friction and opening the funnel to more customers. We're also rolling out a new invoicing experience with a more streamlined workflow and improved design, which is driving an increase in the percentage of companies that send payment-enabled invoices. Looking ahead, we're tackling another big challenge for our small business customers, B2B payments. More than $2 trillion of invoices were managed in QuickBooks in fiscal year 2022. As we shared at Investor Day, we are launching the QuickBooks Business Network, which connects small business customers to each other, making it easier for them to do business. It's currently in beta testing, and we expect to launch more broadly later this fiscal year. We're also building our own bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. We're excited about our opportunities for growth with Mailchimp and payments becoming the center of small business growth. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy and the power of our platform. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever for our customers. We have a large TAM with low penetration, secular shifts working in our favor, a diversified large-scale platform where we continue to invest heavily in innovation across our 5 Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers, resulting in top line growth and margin expansion. We're proud to be an employer of choice as well as the financial technology platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now let me hand it over to Michelle. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michelle M. Clatterbuck, Intuit Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $76 million versus $195 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $662 million versus $555 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.14 versus $0.82 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.53 last year. Turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 38% during the quarter and 19% on an organic basis, excluding $264 million in Mailchimp revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 60% in Q1 or 28% excluding Mailchimp. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 29% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 109% in Q1. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 28%. Mailchimp revenue included in online services was $264 million, up low teens versus a year ago, in line with our expectations. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally, and we began to execute our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 172% in Q1 and 19% on an organic basis excluding Mailchimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. As a reminder, the subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with QBO pricing. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits during the quarter. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward. Moving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 2% to $425 million in Q1. This was below our expectations of mid-single-digit growth we shared at Investor Day due to further deterioration in all verticals the last few weeks of the quarter. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards, offset by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans. As the macro environment continues to remain uncertain, we're seeing an impact across all verticals. Sasan touched on this briefly earlier, but let me unpack what we're seeing. In credit cards, many financial institution partners have tightened eligibility, particularly in riskier segments. In personal loans, we saw continued pressure with many partners tightening eligibility further while increasing APRs. We continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. As a result, we are reducing our fiscal 2023 Credit Karma revenue guidance to a decline of 15% to 10%. This embeds the current trends we're seeing and additional conservatism in the remainder of the year despite the expected continued rollout of several new innovations. Consumer Group revenue was $150 million, reflecting a strong finish to the tax season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted category in the tax prep market as we head into the next tax season. We're focused on making TurboTax a compelling destination for filers who prefer assistance to complete their taxes accurately and quickly. Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue of $34 million was in line with our expectations. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $7 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable January 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared last quarter, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. As Sasan shared earlier, we are reiterating our operating income and earnings per share expectation for fiscal year 2023 despite our lower revenue expectations for Credit Karma. We're able to do this by reducing spend in areas where we expect to see lower returns near term. Last quarter, I mentioned we identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios, and the adjustments we have made are an example. Given the breadth of our offerings and the power of our diversified platform, we have the ability to maintain earnings power despite our expectation for lower Credit Karma revenue. At the same time, we have the ability to make the necessary platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our short- and long-term commitments. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our revenue guidance for Credit Karma as trends in all verticals further deteriorated in the last few weeks of the quarter and into November. We now expect revenue to decline 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance range of 10% to 15% revenue growth. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for all other segments and now expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12% versus the previous range of 14% to 16%. For the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we continue to expect 19% to 20% revenue growth. And for the Consumer Group, we continue to expect 9% to 10% revenue growth. In both businesses, we expect the majority of our growth this year to come from customer growth and mix. We are reiterating our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2023. This demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified platform and business model. So to recap, for fiscal year 2023, we expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP loss per share of $0.29 to $0.23, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.45. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Thank you, Michelle. As you all heard from Michelle and I, we're seeing continued momentum as a result of our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform, growing Intuit double digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. And with that, let me turn it over to your questions. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our first question will come from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sitikantha Panigrahi, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan, you lowered your Credit Karma growth now from 10% to 15% growth to decline now 15% to 10%. Just want to dig a little bit into your assumption for the remaining quarters in this fiscal year. Where do you see -- how conservative is this guidance? And I know that the Karma guarantee will be rolled out sometime later this year. Where can we see some kind of upside surprise if macro stays at the current level? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Thanks for your question, Siti. So a couple of things. One, as you heard from Michelle, we took the current sort of trends that we were seeing in sort of end of October into November into account. But we also very intentionally included further conservatism, deterioration just to be prudent. And so when we look at things around delinquency rates and unemployment, which is really what financial institutions look at to make future decisions, although they are at historical lows, the assumption is that they're going to deteriorate. And so we just assumed that they will significantly deteriorate, and we wanted to include that in our go-forward guidance. We take a lot of pride in the commitments that we make at the company level, and we want to make sure that we're very prudent in terms of the assumptions that we made with the guidance going forward. With that said, I think what I would amplify is our innovation that we talked about at Investor Day. Beyond things like Karma Guarantee, we are actually -- we have launched, it's almost at full scale, something called the Marketplace, where we're giving more exposure to personalized experiences around cards and personal loans to our members. And now with the integration of Mint and Credit Karma, which was part of our refreshed Big Bet 3 vision that we talked about at Investor Day, we expect in the future to have additional sort of capabilities and innovations for our prime customers, which has not been our sweet spot in -- on the Credit Karma platform. So we are leaning into our innovation and those possibilities. We are not counting on any of that impacting the growth rate that you just heard from Michelle and I for the fiscal year, and we just simply believe that's the right thing to do. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sitikantha Panigrahi, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And then a quick follow-up on the small business side. That's pretty impressive quarter, and it grew 19% organically. And if I look at your guidance for remaining 3 quarters, you just have to grow 14% to hit your guidance. You already -- like you talked about price mix shift and -- or you already raised pricing 10% to 25%. So what are you seeing in the small business side? And what are your assumptions for the remaining of the year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Sure. Absolutely. First of all, I would start by saying we have a lot of visibility into things around consumer spending, which is charge volume. We see the number of employees, whether they're going up and down. We see a number of hours worked. We see cash reserves. And of course, there's our metrics around acquisition, retention, payments and payroll volume and also what we see across Mailchimp. And what we're seeing across the board is a continued flight to digitization. If you use our payments capability, you get paid faster, and cash flow is more critical in this environment. If you use our payroll capabilities, you're actually able to reduce errors and pay your employees and have money moved from your bank account to their bank account same day versus 2 weeks in advance. With the use -- innovation that you've heard from us on Mailchimp, we're actually starting to see customer growth tick up. And so those are just illustrative examples are -- we're just continuing to see based on our innovation a flight to digitization, which is the strength that you heard from us in the first quarter. And we expect that momentum to continue the rest of the year. And we remain steadfast on our guidance until we see more quarters, but it is not at all about our sentiment about small business. We actually feel very good about what we're seeing across the board in small business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bradley Hartwell Sills, BofA Securities, Research Division - Director, Analyst [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just a question on the reiterated operating income guide. You lowered top line by, it looks like, about $700 million, yet you're able to sustain your operating income guidance, which is impressive and it speaks to the flexibility in your model. Michelle, you alluded to some adjustments that were made. If you could just provide a little bit of color as to where those adjustments were made in the business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michelle M. Clatterbuck, Intuit Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Brad... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorry, Michelle, go ahead. I was going to ask who the question was for. But Michelle, please go ahead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michelle M. Clatterbuck, Intuit Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No worries. No worries. Thank you, Brad. Yes, it is one of the things that we feel very good about. As I talked about on a previous call, when we were going through our planning for this year, we were really looking at making sure we had identified areas that we could take action on, the levers we could pull if we did see the macro environment get worse. Those things look like marketing expenses, things that we just don't think are going to pay off in the near term; other areas like travel, discretionary spend. But we are protecting R&amp;D and our innovation. And we are continuing to invest. Our investments and our head count continue to go up across the company. And yes, Credit Karma, we have taken the revenue down with a revenue hit there. But when we look at really being able to manage our expenses, it is looking across the company holistically and really focusing on the areas where we think we're not going to see as much return in the short term so that we can continue to focus longer term and drive the innovation. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bradley Hartwell Sills, BofA Securities, Research Division - Director, Analyst [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Excellent. And Sasan, one for you, if I may, please. Last year, we saw a little bit of moderation in TurboTax ASP growth. You talked a little bit about that at the Analyst Day. I think it was 4% on paid ARPU versus, I think, 8% in prior years. If you could elaborate a bit on what went on there. And should we see some acceleration here? Now that you're getting into more experience with TT Live and full service, might we actually see some acceleration in TurboTax ARPU? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. Absolutely. I think the way to think about it is in the long term and from a trajectory perspective, we should see ARPU go up. And now every year, strategically, we make decisions in terms of where we may expand our free offering or where we may increase price based on the leverage that we see in the marketplace, which is primarily in our assisted offerings. And those were some of the adjustments that we made last year. And as we look into this year, we actually feel very good about our do-it-yourself platform lineup. And really, our biggest leverage is going to come from accelerating what we're seeing across the TurboTax Live platform, which is really where the growth is coming from. It's really where the ARPU comes from, and it's where our biggest opportunity is with a $20 billion TAM in front of us. And of course, over time, opening up an additional $10 billion TAM with business taxes. So that was really the intent and the logic behind why ARPU was probably a little bit slower growth last year versus prior years. And I think the way to think about it is we're going to continue to see ARPU growth into the future, and a lot of it will come from the assisted segment. And that's really part of our plan that we're executing against this coming year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brad Alan Zelnick, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Head of Software Equity Research and Senior US Software Research Analyst [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Can you guys hear me? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Perfect. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brad Alan Zelnick, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Head of Software Equity Research and Senior US Software Research Analyst [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Sasan, you guys are always very transparent, great disclosure. And my question is maybe a little bit bigger picture. Can you talk about the opportunity to open up and externalize into its platform services to third parties for developing their own apps with live expert functionality, rich data services, money movement perhaps, and the things that are making you so successful? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Absolutely. Great question. This was actually, at Investor Day, one of our, what we call Horizon 3 ideas that we have invested in, which is around externalizing services. So first and foremost, we do see a big problem space out there where developers and partners and firms look to access and have a need for things like around our virtual expert platform services to connect people to experts, or had a use for our identity services and have a use for our fraud and risk capabilities. So there's a lot of services that we have across our platform that you heard Mariana talk about of which there is a need for those services externally. Now we want to be very choiceful and intentional what we choose to externalize and what we choose not to externalize and what problems we choose to solve and which ones we intentionally choose not to solve. But we do believe it as an opportunity. It's actually something that we funded about a little bit over 15 months ago, and we have a mission-based team that is working on it. And when we have more to share in terms of launches and anything that we think over time will be material for all of you to be aware, we'll be the first to share with you. But we do see it as an exciting Horizon 3 idea that's been funded and are excited about the prospects of it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Raimo Lenschow, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Analyst [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wanted to ask on Mailchimp. So last quarter, you pointed out that you were kind of working on go-to-market a little bit. You wanted to adjust that. This sound -- this quarter, you sounded better, and it looks like you're using Mailchimp like the lead to go -- to attack the international markets more broadly. Can you speak a little bit about what you do there, the progress that you're making, where you are in that journey, please? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Absolutely. First of all, I'll just state that I'm really excited about Rania that we just put into the business and the leadership team that she is building in. It is the result of that leadership team where we are seeing accelerated innovation. And as I mentioned a moment ago, there's been a lot of innovation just in the last sort of 3 to 4 months in Mailchimp from an entirely new brand campaign where we communicate the benefit to how you can grow your business to SMBs, both on air and on -- through digital assets. We've redesigned our website. So when you come to us, you're very clear about the benefits that we offer, the choices that you have and why it can help fuel the success of your business, to then revamping the first-time use experience, along with what we have just implemented for, I would say, higher-value, larger Mailchimp customers and new customers that we want to pursue, which is a 1-hour assisted onboarding to help you get on to the platform, to help you understand the benefits of the platform. And in context of what we've shared around international and Mailchimp as sort of the lead internationally, we are right now focused on localizing the language. Where we have localized language versus not, we have more than 13 points conversion variants. And so of course, localized language is one of our largest levers internationally, along with having a playbook that we're putting in place around go-to-market to raise awareness. So a lot of those things we have already launched that I mentioned, and the localizing languages we're working on as we speak. And a lot of what we -- what I just shared, we're starting to see a real impact from customer uptick, expansion revenue. And we're excited about the possibilities and the momentum that the leadership team is building. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stewart Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD &amp; Fundamental Research Analyst [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congrats on a good quarter. Sasan, you all are in a somewhat unique position that you get to see demand -- sort of demand on both the front-office side as well as sort of the back-office side with Mailchimp and then QuickBooks. I was wondering if you could give us any when you look at the demand indicators from a front-office perspective or a back-office perspective. Are they similar? Are they different? Is there anything you've noticed now that you get to have some insight into sort of that other part of the -- of essentially the operating ecosystem of your customers? Obviously, there's just a lot of discussion in the market right now between front-office and back-office demand. So I was wondering if you can enlighten us, I guess, with any of your thoughts on that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Sure, Kirk. And let me try to be descriptive about it, so I'm not overly generic. I think our customers that we serve, the small businesses between 0 to 100 employees, don't as much think about back office, front office. They just really look to have a platform to be able to grow their business and to be able to manage their cash flow. So if you think about our QuickBooks platform, let me start there, and I'll get to Mailchimp in a moment. Really, QuickBooks helps you manage your cash flow, all your money coming in and money going out. And the notion of digitization is really important for customers, which is why we're enjoying the growth that we just shared. And that really comes down to customers can use QuickBooks to be organized. They can get paid much faster with -- using our payments capabilities. They can get access to capital. They can have instant money flow from their bank to their employees' banks by using our payroll. If they're out in the field, they can use our time tracking so everything is automated. All those things are about digitization. And the way small businesses think about it is it actually helps them with their cash flow because we also -- with all those capabilities, project your cash flow. So that's the real big value sort of QuickBooks. And then you add to that Mailchimp. The real value of Mailchimp is don't think about it as these are not enterprise customers. These are smaller -- small businesses that where their sort of lifeline comes from being able to reach out and manage their existing customers, but also effectively be able to grow their customer base. And so the reason we're continuing to see an uptick based on our innovation and based on just good execution. And I think the best is yet ahead of us in Mailchimp, is that is separate and distinct from do I spend more money on advertising dollars. When you use Mailchimp, you have the ability to use our tools with a subscription that you pay on a monthly basis to be able to, in an automated way, reach out to your customers, market to new customers. And we're seeing sort of equal demand, if I go back to your frame of front office versus back office. I think where there is slower spend and declining is spending money on advertising dollars. That is not what Mailchimp is. Mailchimp is not impacted by advertising dollars. It's actually a -- it's a platform that you use to be able to manage your customers even if you choose to spend less advertising dollars. You can still use Mailchimp very effectively to be able to manage your customers. So that's why the demand is strong with Mailchimp and QuickBooks, and that's really what we see across the platform. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next quarter in Q1. The question that we're all going to get tomorrow from investors is, is the outlook derisked? So I wanted to dig into kind of like your guys thought process. When you're talking about Credit Karma, you told us that -- you looked at sort of the trends that happened in -- at the end of the quarter in the last couple of weeks, and you assume that those trends deteriorate a little bit further on a go-forward basis to get a conservative Credit Karma guide. Can you talk to us about -- like you didn't change any of the other numbers. All the other sort of business lines are kind of intact with your prior expectations. But is there any similar kind of derisking then? Like are you assuming any degradation in the underlying business for QBO or Mailchimp or like any of the other businesses in a similar way you are Credit Karma? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Keith, thank you for your question. And I just want to acknowledge that you and others were pushing us on our Credit Karma guide at Investor Day. And let me just start at the top level to share sort of what we've learned and what we've adjusted, and then I'll answer your question. When we look across tax, which is 35% of the company; and then when you look at across small business, which is over 50% of the company, so that's like 86% of the company, we have sort of -- which includes Mailchimp, we have proven and tried KPIs that allows us to see things well into sort of the future not only to ensure that we're investing in all the right things, but also be able to be very intentional and thoughtful about how we guide because we take our guidance very seriously. One of the things that we learned with Credit Karma is there are 2 factors that we look at but we did not take into account: one is unemployment, the other is delinquency rate. And what I mean by that, not taking it into account as we view it, we look at it, and they're at historical lows. And the one thing that we learned from this process, what we are adjusting and have adjusted our KPIs is just looking at where they are today, but also projecting where they could be a year from now. And ultimately, projecting what could happen if we were sitting in the shoes of some of the partners that are on our platform. So that is a very important shift, which actually gets at the point you made around our Credit Karma guidance. We feel that it is absolutely derisked. We -- as you heard from Michelle and I, we have built a deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year because we have taken into account uptick in both unemployment and delinquency rates, and therefore, have put out a guidance that we believe is derisked. To go to the second part of your question, tax, which is 35% of the company, that is really economically resilient. So let me focus my answer on Small Business. Because of our KPIs and the rich data that we have access to and what we see within Small Business, we actually feel like our guidance in Small Business is derisked because we make certain assumptions around how things will potentially play out the remainder of the year that we took into account when we set the initial guidance, and we still feel very good about the guidance. And you can see based on what we delivered in Q1, we can just do the math and see what it means for the rest of the year. So we feel very good about the way we set guidance in those 2 businesses. We feel very good about the guidance in those areas for the rest of the year. And hopefully, my explanation made sense around Credit Karma. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. Yes, that's super helpful. And then just one clarification question. On Mailchimp, it looks like the revenues was basically flat, maybe down a little bit sequentially. I'm assuming there is a currency impact in there. Can you -- is there like a constant currency number that we could see kind of like how it grew sequentially? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. It's actually -- it is in constant currency. I mean maybe, Michelle, I'll let you chime in here in a moment. But I think what I would say is we -- when you look at our innovation and when you look at our customer uptick and the expansion revenue that we're starting to see, it's actually very much in line with what we would have expected because a lot of our innovation that is in place is actually now accelerating the growth of the business. Because remember, this business was run for cash flow and profitability, and now we're running it for growth. And we're actually quite pleased with the impact that we're starting to see, and we would expect that to accelerate in the upcoming quarters. But Michelle, do you want to chime in on the currency version? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michelle M. Clatterbuck, Intuit Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. The only thing I would clarify is that Mailchimp actually sold at U.S. dollars, and so there isn't a currency impact there for the international, even though 50% of their sales are outside the U.S. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Analyst [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congrats on the results. Sasan and Michelle, curious to get your perspective. We don't like recessions, but this is a recession -- maybe it's a recession that we've all been anticipating. It's the most widely anticipated one. So what are the assumptions that you have incorporated in your forecasting for the foreseeable future? I mean, is it an uptick in attrition or maybe the expansion rates come down a little bit? I'm just curious to get your thoughts on what you've dialed in with your current go around of trajections. And also, Sasan, if you could talk about payments. You clearly demoed at the analyst event, very, very impressive. Clearly, it's got a lot of potential. What should we be expecting? What are you expecting in your payments business in the medium term to long term? What are your goals? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Thanks for the question, Kash. Just in terms of your question around assumptions, I think on Credit Karma, hopefully, what I just shared a moment ago resonated in that. We are assuming sort of further deterioration and conservatism in the back half of the year -- or the remainder of the year, I should say, despite a lot of innovation that is still coming to market because we're just -- we're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates getting worse, which means that financial institutions, although we're one of the last platforms they pull off of that they will be conservative in terms of their investment levels. So those are the assumptions that we've made for the remainder of the fiscal year for Credit Karma. And for Small Business, a lot of the strength that we're continuing to see is just -- it's a shift to digitization from folks that are already on our platform. So we have a lot of customers that are on our platform. If you remember, we used the figure out there -- there's $2 trillion of invoices being managed on our platform, and we have over $100 million that as part of our -- well over $100 million as part of our payments charge volume, which means we have a huge opportunity to penetrate that within our existing base. And I use that just as an illustrative example, Kash. To answer your question, we're not making any assumptions around payments uptick because the macro environment will get better in the second half of the year. We're actually assuming that a lot of the growth that we are seeing is just continuing shift to digitization from those that are on our platform. And so we make customer acquisition assumptions. We make attrition assumptions. We'll look at assumptions around payments and payroll that are really in the context of how we feel about the environment going forward. Although we're not seeing it within our SMB segment, we are assuming a level of conservatism as we think about the remainder of the year. And those are the assumptions that we've made for both Small Business and Credit Karma. And tax, again, tax is economically resilient. We pretty much make assumptions based on our penetration in the assisted segment. And that's really -- that and the total number of IRS returns is where our assumptions come from. And again, those are -- that's economically resilient. So that's how we think about the guide going forward as we just reiterated. In terms of payments, listen, payments is one of the areas that we're the most excited about. If I had to pick a couple of areas, it's Mailchimp, it's payments, and it's what we're doing to go upmarket and with QuickBooks Advanced and mid-market. And with payments, we spent 4 or 5 years building out all of our fraud and risk capabilities, all of our AI capabilities, and we're just innovating very fast with that team. And a lot of the future around what we can do to digitize B2B around what's possible with bill pay, that -- those are yet to come and not even in our forecast going forward. We just believe that there's so much room for penetration attached going forward. So hopefully, our (inaudible) payments has been to your liking, but we think our best is yet ahead of us. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Andrew Schneeberger, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan, I'm curious, I'm kind of honing in on Credit Karma and credit cards, which I believe is about half of the revenue. And please correct me if that's changed, perhaps gone up, based on what personal loans has done. But just how are you looking at credit cards? What are you seeing with consumers there? I understand it was the strength in that segment of the quarter versus personal loans, home loans, auto loans, auto insurance. What -- specifically in the credit cards, is that strengthening -- or maybe not strengthening, but weakening a lot less? Just honing in on that specific segment, what are you seeing from the consumer? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Sure, Scott. First of all, it is -- as you said, it's a large part of the overall Credit Karma platform. With that said, I'll start with context that when you look at the 129 million customers or members that we serve on Credit Karma, the majority of our focus has been sub-prime and near-prime customers. And that's really a lot of our personalized experiences are for those cohorts. And one of the things that we're very excited about that we have shared at Investor Day is we're also building out capabilities and innovation for prime customers. And that's why we shifted Mint over, and we're combining the Mint and Credit Karma platform. So that context is important because as you hear my answer, just hear it from the lens of the majority of where our business comes from is sub-prime and near-prime. In the future, we'll also have capabilities, innovation and ultimately, revenue that will come up front and prime as well, which positions us really well in the marketplace. And with all of that said, in essence, yes, we're continuing to see growth in credit cards, but we're actually assuming that, that will really deteriorate the rest of the year based on unemployment going up and delinquency rates going up. And as you heard from both Michelle and I, we have built conservatism into the remainder of the year. And so there's -- which will ultimately result in declining growth rate. But what we saw in Q1 and the growth rate of the 2%, a lot of the headwinds in other verticals was offset by credit cards. But we have assumed that, that will get worse over time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Andrew Schneeberger, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Appreciate that. And then following on -- it's kind of more on the tax side, but overall, the guidance for the second quarter seems to be the most derisked with EPS down year-over-year. And that's an uncommon sequential change. But it sounds like the levers Michelle is pulling, it sounded like marketing and advertising was one of them. I infer that it's more in the small business side. But just curious on the tax side, are you doing anything differently now that we may have a more normal tax season versus the past few with regard to advertising timing or overall? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Sure. I'm actually glad you asked about our second quarter guide of 8% to 9%. First of all, our momentum in Small Business continues into Q2. There are 2 elements that drive our guide of 8% to 9% revenue growth in second quarter. One is we always make assumptions for tax. As you know, tax is tricky between second quarter and third quarter. And we make assumptions around when the IRS will open, forms availability, and those assumptions drive what we assume will happen in our tax business. And in some cases, we have elements of our tax business that actually we've assumed may decline in the second quarter. So that drives our guidance overall at the company level for Q2. And then Q2 generally has been seasonally the weakest quarter for Credit Karma because of the month of November, December and January and then just the number of holidays. It's seasonally the weakest quarter. So when you combine our assumptions with tax and you combine our assumptions with Credit Karma, that's where you get Q2 where it is. And hopefully, that answers your question. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Andrew Schneeberger, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It does. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allan M. Verkhovski, Wolfe Research, LLC - Research Analyst [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is Allan Verkhovski on for Alex Zukin. I think more people are warming up to your ability in hitting your SMB guide for the year despite the challenging macro. But I want to dig further into what you're seeing in the SMB segment today. Can you talk about what you saw around ARPC growth in the quarter, excluding the benefit you observed from the pricing increases that went into effect? It'd be helpful to get how much of a tailwind the pricing increase was in the quarter for QBO accounting and better understand the quarter how your growth levers, such as customer growth, upselling and cross-selling, were impacted from the macro, if at all? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Sure. Absolutely. The majority of our guide for the year and what we also saw in Q1 actually came from customer growth and mix, and mix includes things like QuickBooks Advanced. And you saw from our online services growth of 28%, we're seeing really sort of good growth from Payroll, Payments, Time Tracking. And that, of course, excludes Mailchimp, and we talked about Mailchimp separately. So I think the short answer to your question is we are seeing the type of balance that we would want, which is our growth coming from customer growth and mix, and price will play an element -- a smaller element, but it plays an important element as we look at not only what we saw in Q1, but what we expect for the remainder of the year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allan M. Verkhovski, Wolfe Research, LLC - Research Analyst [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, if I may. On the Mailchimp front, I want to follow up to Keith's earlier point around Mailchimp revenues being sequentially relatively flat. Could you share maybe something more about maybe conversion rates? Or just a follow-up on the acceleration comment you made through the full year, just anything that could give us more color for how we think about potential revenue growth of Mailchimp for the full year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Yes. Absolutely. I mean if you go back to when we closed the deal almost a year ago, one of the things that we were very clear about, in addition to our excitement around the asset and the fact that now combined with QuickBooks, we can have one growth platform that can be the source of truth for -- and the source of growth for a small business, one of the things that we reiterated was that this was really a business that was run for profitability and it was run for cash flow. And even particularly in COVID times, where you saw a lot of front-office company accelerate, Mailchimp really didn't because, again, it was more run for cash flow and profitability. And so we worked very hard in the last year to put a playbook in place in context of the priorities that we've shared to accelerate growth. And those priorities, they always take time to shift the business from being run for profitability and cash flow, to being run for a growth business, typically, takes a couple of years. And we're actually starting to see a trajectory change within the first year. And we're quite demanding of ourselves in terms of the velocity that we would like to see. So really, what's happened there last year is we were taking a business that was, again, run for profitability, cash flow to revamping the website, coming up with a new campaign, revamping the product. And when I say revamp, it's not done. We've not reached the destination. It's just the beginning of what's possible to really focus on high-value customers to position ourselves to go after mid-market to start ramping up what we can do internationally. All of these things, we're starting to now see indicators where in the quarter, although it was sequentially flat from a revenue perspective, we're seeing conversion from free to pay is up. We're seeing customer growth tick up. We're actually seeing expansion revenue, which means our customers are growing and they're upgrading what SKU they use. We're starting to see these, and these things really become future indicators of growth. And that's why the comment that I made earlier and Michelle made earlier around, we expect that the growth in Mailchimp to accelerate in the coming quarters because we're seeing the KPIs around customer growth, expansion retention, these things are starting to improve. So hopefully, that helps to answer your question. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question will come from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steven Lester Enders, Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Research Analyst [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I guess I just want to clarify a little bit on what you're seeing on the Credit Karma side and what you talked about historically on that front and what you're expecting for the guide here. I think before, you talked about expecting an acceleration kind of in the back half of the year as you kind of combine the cross-sell with TurboTax here. I guess, how are you thinking about that opportunity now given kind of where the macro is and what you're assuming versus the cross-sell that could potentially come here? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. We have taken -- thank you for the question. We have taken sort of a firewall approach here. One is we're very excited about the innovations that we talked about at Investor Day. And in fact, the only thing that's changed is we've added a few more innovations that we've launched within Credit Karma. The Marketplace that I shared earlier is one of them, where -- and it's almost at full scale where our customers see an additional tablet, a marketplace of all the products that are right for them in one place that brings more visibility and brings to the forefront products that are right for a specific cohort of customers. So in terms of the integration with TurboTax, you're going to see a far more robust experience this year with Credit Karma being integrated into TurboTax and vice versa. Credit Karma Guarantee continues to be on track in terms of a rollout to customer -- to members and financial institutions. All the innovations that we talked about, plus a few more are all on track, and we're equally as excited about the impact that it will have. And very consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, what we talked about then was that these innovations were not reliant on a macro pickup. They're just -- they're going to deliver more benefits, and therefore, more monetization. Back to the word firewall, we're not counting on those innovations in our results when we think about the rest of the year. We're assuming current trends. We're assuming further conservatism for the remainder of the year. We're making assumptions around unemployment going up, delinquency rates going up. And so therefore, that's informed our guide of minus 15% to minus 10%. And that's sort of separate and distinct from the innovation that we continue to be excited and focused on and are on track for the rollout. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steven Lester Enders, Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Research Analyst [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And I guess just to clarify again on Mailchimp. I know that last quarter, you were putting some changes in place to kind of improve conversion rates and really kind of rightsize or kind of build out some of the structure of that business. Like where are those changes you're making kind of at, at this point? And how should we kind of think about the level that so this kind of go in there to kind of more kind of rightsize that business? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. Let me answer your question. I'm not sure what you mean by rightsize where -- is this -- we are very focused on investing in Mailchimp and accelerating the growth combined with the QuickBooks platform. And I would say a couple of big things that we have put in place and are continuing to implement. One is really strengthening the leadership team at all levels. We're very excited about leaders that we -- had joined the Mailchimp family and with Rania's addition to the Mailchimp team, with additional changes that we are making to continue to strengthen the team, very excited about the impact there because that's having a direct impact on innovation, which is the second point I want to make. I really like the velocity, particularly what I've seen in the last 90 days. And I actually hope to see Mailchimp being one of the highest-velocity innovative teams across the company with the team that we have in place. And I think everything that I mentioned earlier that we have launched is a result of the impact of that team. And lastly, it's about impact. And we're starting to see the key performance indicators that I mentioned earlier uptick in the right direction, which means that almost a year in, it's not been quite a year, but almost a year in, I feel very good about sort of year 2 because we've put a lot of foundational things in place in year 1. We have a lot of work still ahead of us. But a lot of the work is about turning this into a sort of a strong growth business and fueling the success of small businesses, and I feel like we are on that trajectory given what I've seen, particularly in the last 90 to 100 days. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [49] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our final question will come from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Daniel William Jester, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Director &amp; Software Analyst [50] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Two quick ones. A lot of talk about the macro with regards to Credit Karma. I'd love to hear about how you're overlaying that macro on QuickBooks Capital and anything you might be doing differently there as the year progresses, given the uncertainty. And then secondarily, Sasan, you talked about some of the economic indicators you track for small business. Are you seeing consistency in the U.S. and international? Or is maybe one geography stronger than the other right now? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [51] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Absolutely. Let me start with your macro question and QuickBooks Capital. We have built incredible machine learning capabilities, where we literally can control the dial of which customers', capacity for customers on a daily basis. And QuickBooks Capital is very important for our customers, and it is not a material sort of revenue driver for the company. It is, however, essential as part of our overall platform. So I think that what I would say is we're very good and have been very good. I think it's been proven, especially during the COVID times, to be able to adjust the doubt so that we offer capital only to those that we can see can pay it back. And remember, the loans that we typically give could be from 30 days to 6 months. And there's a ceiling for all of these loans. So we feel very good about the macro environment impact and how we manage our QuickBooks Capital within that context, and I think we've proven that during COVID. The second element of your question, I would love to sort of parse it out in 2 ways. One is even in the U.S., there are sectors within small business. Remember, we're very diversified in the small businesses that we serve. But there are segments within small businesses that have gotten hit hard. Those that focus on auto sales, those that focus on financial services, those that focus on real estate. Some of their revenues are down 10% to 15%, but you don't really see that in our results because we're very, very diversified. We're not -- no one sector can really impact our overall results. So that's in context of the globe, but it's also in context of the U.S. Not every sector is created equal. Some sectors are hit hard, the ones that I just mentioned. I would say U.S. has been the strongest, followed by Canada. And the ones that have been hit the hardest has been U.K., Australia and France. And again, our -- we're not -- we've not assumed any of this in our guidance, but our hope is those will, over time, begin to bounce back. We've not seen the bounce back yet, but they've been hit harder than the U.S. And I think that was the last question. And so maybe I can bring us to a close by saying thank you for all of your wonderful questions. And be safe, and we look forward to seeing all of you for our second quarter earnings results. Until then, be safe. Thank you, everybody. Bye-bye. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [52] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.]"

non-GAAP financial measures. Table B1, Table B2, and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:Share-based compensation expenseAmortization of acquired technologyAmortization of other acquired intangible assetsGoodwill and intangible asset impairment chargesGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assetsProfessional fees and transaction costs for business combinationsWe also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:Gains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investmentsIncome tax effects and adjustmentsDiscontinued operationsWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit’s operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.Share-based compensation expenses. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire a business in a business combination, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the business and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete, and trade names.Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results.Professional fees and transaction costs for business combinations. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees.Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and gains and losses on other investments.Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant acquisitions, changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. We will evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate.Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of business and long-lived assets.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221129005009/en/ContactsInvestorsKim WatkinsIntuit Inc.650-944-3324kim_watkins@intuit.comMediaAbby SmithIntuit Inc.408-839-6028abby_smith@intuit.com]"

But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) share price is 49% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. In comparison, the share price is down 4.0% in a year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Stryker While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Stryker achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Stryker has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Stryker's TSR for the last 5 years was 58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Stryker shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 2.8% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 18%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Stryker has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NYSE:IR) Could Be Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ingersoll-rand-inc-nyse-191330028.html,1669749210,STORY,['TT'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Ingersoll Rand’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand What Is Ingersoll Rand Worth?Great news for investors – Ingersoll Rand is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $67.34, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Ingersoll Rand’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Ingersoll Rand generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Ingersoll Rand's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 68%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since IR is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IR for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IR. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

345,a762aa34-1f91-3a47-9240-1c7b3f566a41,GE,2022-11-30,"With 72% ownership, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/72-ownership-general-electric-company-130042355.html,1669813242,STORY,['GE'],"[A look at the shareholders of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of General Electric, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.General Electric already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at General Electric's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in General Electric. The company's largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company, with ownership of 9.1%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.9% and 7.5% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of General Electric Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$229m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in General Electric. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

346,5f51e862-ddbe-34cd-ad9a-a81dc8ba342f,GE,2022-11-30,General Electric (GE) to Offer CT Motion Injector in U.S.,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-ge-offer-ct-145602848.html,1669733762,STORY,"['GE', 'PH', 'IEX', 'AIT']","[General Electric’s GE Healthcare unit is collaborating with Ulrich Medical to offer contrast media injectors in the United States under the brand name CT motion.The CT motion is a multi-dose syringeless injector that delivers iodinated contrast media for Computed Tomography (""CT"") imaging procedures. It reduces procedure setup time and improves patient throughput by removing extensive preparation steps while simultaneously optimizing patient dosing.According to a statement released by General Electric, recent research shows that CT motion can enable six additional patient CT exams each day compared to a regular dual-syringe-based injector using single or multi-dose vials. The research also shows that the GE Healthcare branded injector reduces cost from consumables and saves 30ml of contrast per procedure, on average.General Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company price | General Electric Company QuoteThe statement released by GE reveals that the U.S. contrast media injector market is estimated to grow at 4.3% annually between 2022 and 2030. This should drive demand for the Healthcare unit’s latest offering.General Electric expects global demand for iodinated contrast media to double in the next 10 years, owing to the prevalence of chronic disorders and growth in CT procedures. To meet this anticipated surge in demand, the company recently invested $80 million at its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients site in Lindesnes, Norway, to increase contrast media manufacturing capacity by 30%.In order to meet the growing demand for iodinated contrast media, GE has also invested $30 million to open an additional manufacturing line at its facility in Cork, Ireland. The company has also entered into a multi-year agreement with Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile to increase the iodine supply. Through these milestones, General Electric aims to reach its broader goal of producing 30 million more doses of contrast media per year by 2025.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGeneral Electric currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are some better-ranked stocks worth mentioning:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Valero Energy (VLO). VLO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. VLO has a P/S ratio of 0.3. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.32.Finally, investors should note that VLO has a P/CF ratio of 4.55. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. VLO's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 5.34. VLO's P/CF has been as high as 15.65 and as low as 3.51, with a median of 9.19, all within the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Valero Energy is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, VLO sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, the oil production cuts declared by OPEC+ further limited supply, boosting demand and prices. In addition, with outflow cuts and scarcity, we’re finding plenty of attractive opportunities with plenty of energy stocks to buy.Perhaps the main concern for investors in energy stocks is the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening efforts. The bank is committed to tackling the rampant inflation rates by raising benchmark interest rates. Moreover, the continued bumps in interest rates will likely impact the demand for energy resources and related commodities. The pandemic pushed oil prices into negative territory for the first time, forcing energy producers to cut back on spending. Moreover, the subsequent deleveraging allowed energy firms to benefit from the rising oil price environment.LNGCheniere Energy$173.08SWNSouthwestern Energy$7.16ENPHEnphase Energy$319.42SMRNuScale Power$11.22COPConocoPhillips$126.81VLOValero Energy$138.40CVXChevron Corp.$183.70Energy Stocks to Buy: Cheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOne of the top energy stocks to buy is Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG), a Houston, Texas-based energy giant occupying a powerful position in the natural gas sector. Europe and Asia are hungry for increased access to natural gas, creating opportunities for Cheniere’s long-term growth potential. The company’s long-term partnership with China’s leading LNG producer, CNOOC Limited, provides an additional growth avenue through which Cheniere’s assets can be utilized.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn addition, its unique geographical positioning puts Cheniere closer to potential buyers in Europe and Asia than its competitors across the globe. Plus, it can take advantage of this secular story shaping up for natural gas production. Even better, its stock trades roughly 21% lower than its 5-year average while offering double-digit returns. Hence, it’s one of the best bets in the energy space for long-term stability.Story continuesEnergy Stocks to Buy: Southwestern Energy (SWN)a gas pipe with the sun going down in the background, naturalSource: ShutterstockAnother one of the top energy stocks to buy is Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN), a natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in Texas. The firm will also benefit from the current push for non-Russian sources of hydrocarbons, with the demand for natural gas expected to surge in the coming years. In addition, earning results over the past few quarters have been stellar, with revenues surging by triple-digit margins. For example, in its most recent quarter, its revenues shot up 183.8% to $4.5 billion. Also, its gross profit and EBITDA margins have also increased by double-digit margins in the past year. Moreover, another positive for the firm is that 60% of its portfolio is hedged, which effectively protects it from natural gas’s downward pricing volatility. As such, investors should consider SWN as one of the energy stocks to buy for the long haul if they seek value and strong shareholder performance.Energy Stocks to Buy: Enphase Energy (ENPH)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comBetween rising energy prices and grid reliability concerns, switching from conventional electricity sources to more emissions-free alternatives can be challenging. Fortunately, such problems have become the core focus of Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Fremont, California, this innovative energy technology business has spent the last decade pioneering a suite of products that are helping to make renewable energy simpler and more accessible than ever before.In addition, from its robust line of solar micro-inverters to its reliable battery energy storage solutions, the firm has only grown in popularity since  inception. Operating results for the firm have been stupendous, to say the least. In the past five years, its sales have grown at over 43% on average with rapid growth in free cash flow margins. Overall the business is likely to grow at similar rates for the foreseeable future on the back of tailwinds towards green energy and solar in particular.NuScale Power (SMR)uranium stocks nuclear powerSource: iStockNuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) is another one of the top energy stocks to buy and is pushing the boundaries of nuclear energy. By harnessing the power of small modular reactors, they are revolutionizing the industry’s capacity to deliver safe, reliable energy. Unlike traditional atomic plants, these facilities can be built almost anywhere around the globe without fear of compromising safety standards.Furthermore, their smaller physical footprint means these SMRs can integrate more easily into existing infrastructure. This could equate to a seismic shift in our power grid. It could also highlight NuScale’s game-changing potential ability to deliver nuclear energy. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), nuclear energy could contribute a sizeable 14% of global electricity by 2050, up from 10%. Firms like NuScale offer a novel product in the sphere and should benefit immensely from its first-movers advantage.ConocoPhillips (COP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a global leader in the oil exploration and production industry. It has operations spanning 13 countries and total assets which exceed $93 billion. This forward-thinking organization has also been generous in rewarding shareholders through dividend returns; over the past five years, offering more than 30% of profits to investors.The firm has consistently performed in the oil and gas space, with 2022 being one of its best years to date. Oil and gas prices surged to new heights this year, which resulted in a gusher of cash flows for the company. In addition, it also delivered $4.7 billion in free cash flows in its third quarter, for another comfortable earnings beat. Moreover, it boosted its quarterly dividend by a hefty 11% and bumped its existing buyback program by $20 billion. With the robustness in energy markets likely to persist for the foreseeable future, I expect COP stock to continue delivering the goods for its investors.Valero Energy (VLO)rising oil prices concept. oil next to green up arrowSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is an American company heavily involved in the oil industry. It’s one of the top leaders in the global energy sector with a well-diversified refinery base throughout Canada, the U.K., and the U.S.In addition, the firm has been booming over the past few months due to fundamental factors that have seen refining margins surge. With no new refineries coming online, existing infrastructures are more heavily relied upon to meet the increasing consumer demand, and Valero is taking full advantage of those circumstances. Valero can also operate at a much higher rate than normal through enough capacity to handle this strong demand, delivering more output and earning increased profit as prices hit new heights. This is great news for investors, who are reaping the benefits of a sturdy company with admirable performance.Chevron (CVX)oil pumps and oil barrels with world map and financial chart graphsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) more commonly known as CVX, has been a player in the energy industry since the late 19th century. At the moment, Chevron operates in hydrocarbon exploration, storage, transportation, refining, and marketing products related to energy conservation. In addition, the company’s ability to manage the early adaptation phases of the transition from traditional oil sources is reflected in its strong balance sheets and healthy liquidity ratios. Also, its debt-to-equity ratio is at just 0.15, significantly better than the industry average. Moreover, CVX is a dividend king, growing its payouts for 35 consecutive years.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque held a LONG position in Solana and Ethereum.

For 2023, the company expects the top line to be within the range of $357-$360 billion, higher than the consensus mark of $352.6 billion.Growing strength in its UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments is likely to support growth.

355,437aca04-ba88-373c-9e9a-2e8b70e05d93,LKQ,2022-11-30,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Genuine Parts and LKQ,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-genuine-132301150.html,1669728181,STORY,"['LKQ', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 29, 2022 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Genuine Parts Co. GPC and LKQ Corp. LKQ.Industry: Auto PartsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2022647/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-on-the-right-track-amid-industry-oddsThe Zacks Automotive- Replacement Parts industry is reeling under chip crunch and supply chain disruptions, which are likely to limit sales. Additionally, increasing cost of raw materials, adverse foreign exchange translations and high research and development expenses are clipping margins. Seemingly, the only silver lining is the increasing longevity of vehicles. In an otherwise gloomy industry, Genuine Parts Co. and LKQ Corp. appear better-positioned, thanks to their strategic buyouts and investor-friendly moves.About the IndustryThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. A few of the important auto replacement components include engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts.The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Key Themes Deciding the Industry's FateCommodity Inflation &amp; Forex Woes: Costs of raw materials like steel and non-ferrous metals are on the rise. Commodity inflation is not likely to abate anytime soon and will act as a major speed bump for quite some time. Industry players acknowledge that the increasing cost of raw materials is set to impact their margins. Further, most industry participants have a global presence, which makes them more vulnerable to forex woes. Adverse foreign currency translations are also likely to impact earnings and margins.Story continuesRising Operational Costs: The industry is bearing high costs for developing technologically advanced auto components amid the soaring popularity of electric vehicles, which is likely to weigh on profits further. With the technology shift in full swing, industry players must develop and upgrade their offerings to remain on par with the evolving trends in the automotive market. The new features and upgrades call for high capex and research and development expenses, which are likely to limit operating margins and cash flows.Supply Chain Snarls: The industry is battling semiconductor shortage— a byproduct of COVID-19 that only worsened with the Russia-Ukraine war. The deficit of microchips is hindering the business operations of the industry participants and the chip crunch is not likely to end anytime soon, in turn resulting in lost revenues. Logistical challenges and disruptions in the supply chain systems are clouding the prospects of the industry.Aging Vehicles: One comforting prospect of the industry is the increasing average age of vehicles. The average age of U.S. vehicles has hit a new record of 12.2 years. In a bid to ensure the long-term functioning of the aging vehicles, customers will more likely spend on repairs, thereby driving the business of auto replacement and repair companies. Also, amid economic uncertainty, customers are more likely to opt for repairing old vehicles rather than splurging on expensive new vehicles.Zacks Industry Rank Paints Gloomy PictureThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #185, which places it in the bottom 26% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since April, the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have moved south by 3.5%.Despite the industry's dim near-term outlook, we will present two stocks worth considering for your portfolio. But before that, let's look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry's Decline Narrower than S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector and Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has declined 1.3% against the sector and the S&amp;P 500's decline of 45.8% and 15.1%, respectively.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. Based on trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 9.27X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12.21X and the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 13.43X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.08X, as low as 6.76X and at a median of 10.02X.2 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnGenuine Parts: Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes auto and industrial replacement parts across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. The KDG and Inneco acquisitions have bolstered the company's Industrial segment. Other strategic bolt-on acquisitions, including Winparts, Rare Spares, PartsPoint and Alliance Automotive Group are adding to the top-line growth of the Automotive segment.GPC's dividend aristocrat status boosts investors' confidence. The company envisions 2022 free cash flow in the band of $1.2-$1.4 billion, calling for a surge from $992 million generated in 2021.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC's 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 16% and 2.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2022 and 2023 earnings signals a year-over-year improvement of 18% and 6%, respectively. Genuine Parts— currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and having a Value Score of A—topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.LKQ Corp: Headquartered in Illinois, LKQ is one of the leading providers of replacement parts, components and systems. The buyouts of Bumblebee Batteries, Elite Electronics, Green Bean Battery, SeaWide Marine Distribution, Greenlight and Fabtech Industries have bolstered the firm's product offerings as well as sales. Low leverage and high liquidity of the firm increase its financial flexibility and lower default risk.As a show of its solid cash flow generation ability and balance sheet strength, the company recently hiked its dividend by 10% from the prior payout and boosted buyback by $1 billion. Between the period of initiating the stock buyback program in late October 2018 to Sep 30, 2022, LKQ repurchased around $2.2 billion worth of stock.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ's 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $4.18, implying 6.6% growth year over year.  The consensus mark for 2023 EPS has moved north by 2 cents a share to $4.18. The company surpassed earnings estimates in the last four quarters, the average surprise being 8%. LKQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of A.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The world is getting warmer due to greenhouse emissions. We are rapidly exhausting our supply of fresh water in many areas. Our social and governance systems can also be improved.With ESG investing, investors invest in companies that do well in terms of trying to make their operations more environmentally friendly, trying to help their communities, and trying to have good corporate governance.As a result of more awareness over the issues facing our world, many investors and institutions have dedicated more resources to ESG investing.According to PwC, asset managements are expected to increase their ESG-related AUM to $33.9 trillion globally by 2026, up from $18.4 trillion in 2021. If successful, ESG assets could constitute over one fifth of the total global assets under management by 2026.In terms of PwC's base case growth scenario, ESG AUM in the United States could rise to $10.5 trillion in 2026 from $4.5 trillion in 2021. In Europe, ESG AUM could increase to $19.6 trillion in 2026. Finally, ESG AUM in the Asia Pacific region could rise to $3.3 trillion.PwC Global Asset &amp; Wealth Management Leader, PwC Ireland Olwyn Alexander said, “ESG has become perhaps the most powerful driver of growth in asset and wealth management. The surge in demand for ESG investments highlighted in our survey exceeds almost all previous expectations.""2022 has been a challenging year given the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times this year alone. As a result of the interest rate increases, many economists think there could be a recession next year. According to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, the U.S. central bank will likely need interest rates above 5% for most of next year and into 2024 to win the battle against inflation. Currently the upper bound for the Federal funds rate is 4%.Story continuesAs a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Hadrian / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor the best 12 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now list, we took the top 12 unique stocks by weight from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) and we ranked them based on percent of funds as of 11/28/2022.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and The Progressive (PGR). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (-1.6% vs. -3.1%) as well as the S&amp;P 500 index (-1.6% vs. -16.4%). This performance momentum has been underpinned by a history of outperformance, with the recent strong Q3 report the 10th straight quarter of better-than-expected top and bottom line results. Sales improved year over year driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.However, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins.

The company continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses.Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.However, exposure to catastrophe losses induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses due to higher losses and settlement expenses remain an overhang on the company's margin.

If you want to read about some more consumer stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider.Consumer stocks are generally considered one of the safest investments at the stock market because of their predictable business models and relatively lower price volatility as compared to other sectors of the economy. Some examples of consumer industries include food and beverage producers, household item manufacturers, personal care product manufacturers, and tobacco companies. The consumer industry is also highly consolidated in nature, a key driver of demand for the sector in a volatile macro environment. Some of the top firms in this space are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). In the past few months, even as inflation impacts the short-term spending trends, there is a belief among experts that this sentiment might weigh on manufacturing stocks longer than expected. However, the long-term growth indicators for the industry remain overwhelmingly positive, making the sector a top retirement stock portfolio pick.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the consumer sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Consumer Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider11.

(NYSE:TSN), compared to 37 in the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion. Just like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat-footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters (…read more)9. The TJX Companies, Inc.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets.

Doing so enables us to both save on jet fuel costs and reduce GHG emissions. American has set a target to achieve a 50 million-gallon absolute reduction in jet fuel use by 2025, using 2019 aircraft as a baseline. That is, aircraft in our fleet as of January 2019 that continue to fly through 2025 will use 50 million gallons less fuel as a result of fuel-efficiency initiatives.We have implemented a host of fuel-savings initiatives, both on the ground and in the air, focused on three key areas:Operating more efficiently on the ground. We have implemented a number of operational changes to reduce on-the-ground fuel use. For example, in 2021, American developed a new application to optimize how we assign gates to aircraft at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). This new approach to gating optimizes for taxi time, maximizes on-time arrivals, reduces ramp congestion, minimizes gate conflicts, saves fuel and reduces GHG emissions. Leveraging real-time Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight data and routing information, we are using the new tool for all our DFW flights today; we also expect to expand its use to other airports. Based on the reduced taxi time resulting from use of the tool today, we project full-year fuel savings of 870,000 gallons at DFW alone, equal to more than 2,600 metric tons of CO2 .American has also reduced the use of onboard auxiliary power units during flight preparation by connecting to less carbon-intensive electric ground power at the airport terminal. We have also increased our use of single-engine taxi operation (i.e., using just one aircraft engine to taxi to the gate after landing), which reduces the carbon emissions produced by taxiing by 20%-40%. In addition, we have implemented new procedures for staggering flight departures and arrivals, which results in less time for aircraft on the ramp and, therefore, less fuel use.Story continuesReducing excess weight. The weight on an aircraft is a critical driver of how much fuel it uses, and even small reductions in weight can add up to significant fuel and GHG emissions savings when multiplied across our whole fleet and the many flights each aircraft makes.We have taken a number of steps to reduce weight on our aircraft, including installing lighter seats, removing seat-back entertainment systems, discontinuing American Way magazine, and stocking our galleys with only as much ice as we expect passengers will use on each flight. Even using lighter paint makes a difference: On our A321 fleet alone, this saves about 1 million gallons of fuel per year. Collectively, our weight-reduction efforts save 12.4 million gallons of fuel annually, which equals 117,800 million metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided each year.Optimizing flight plans and procedures. We focus on flying as efficiently as possible, which includes consid ering everything from the speed and paths our aircraft take on departure and descent to how flight crews adjust en route to account for changing weather conditions.Since we began deploying specialized software in 2020 that uses real-time weather conditions to provide our flight crews with better data about optimal flight altitudes and speeds, we have saved more than 8.4 million gallons of fuel. That translates to just over 80,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided. This and other flight planning improvements also help us optimize the amount of arrival fuel on the aircraft - that is, the extra fuel carried on the aircraft - which makes a big difference in reducing weight and, therefore, improving fuel efficiency.Increasing Efficiency by Modernizing Our Air Traffic Control SystemImproving the country's network of aviation infrastructure, technology and services will increase operational efficiency and reduce jet fuel use. In turn, that will avoid millions of metric tons of CO2 emissions annually and help reduce aviation's carbon footprint. Improvements in our Air Traffic Control (ATC) system will produce enormous environmental and economic benefits, and American supports efforts to modernize our ATC system. We encourage policymakers to advance policies that achieve that objective, and we are committed to working with the FAA and other policymakers to make it a reality.In 2021, the FAA implemented more efficient descent procedures that will make a meaningful impact in reducing fuel use and associated CO2 emissions. American supported designing the new procedures by providing technical data and expertise on aircraft behavior and systems, energy management considerations and application. The new Optimized Profile Descents allow planes to glide down safely from cruising altitudes into airspace around some of the nation's largest airports, instead of the traditional stair-step procedure that consumes more fuel. For each group of descents used at an airport, the FAA estimates that an average of 2 million gallons of fuel is saved, and 18,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions are reduced annually.*American has also partnered with the FAA and NASA on a trial program in Charlotte, North Carolina, to test and validate the benefits of Terminal Flight Data Manager infrastructure. During testing at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, the program reduced taxi times, helping to save more than 275,000 gallons of fuel annually. The program also avoided almost eight tons of CO2 emissions daily and cut delays by 916 hours over four years, equivalent to an average of 15 minutes of wait time on a taxiway for more than 3,600 departing flights.** In 2021, NASA transferred findings from the trial program to the FAA for nationwide implementation.* https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-implements-more-efficient-descent-procedures-reduce-fuel-burn-emissions.** https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-transfers-air-traffic-management-tool-updates-to-faa.Read MoreAmerican Airlines, Tuesday, November 29, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/729315/American-Airlines-Flight-Operations-and-Efficiency]"

Check out our latest analysis for Eaton Eaton Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, April Boise, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$139 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$162, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 43% of April Boise's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Eaton shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Eaton Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Eaton. In total, Executive VP &amp; CFO Thomas Okray sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Eaton Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Eaton insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$220m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Eaton Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Eaton stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that Eaton is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Eaton. While conducting our analysis, we found that Eaton has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.But note: Eaton may not be the best stock to buy.

Expose the Data.,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-advance-inclusion-diversity-dont-161000394.html,1669738200,STORY,['ETN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 29, 2022 / Business leaders today know that diverse teams drive smarter, better decisions. How? An emerging body of research indicates that heterogeneous teams spark creativity and challenge our standard ways of thinking, which in turn, strengthens our performance.Eaton, Tuesday, November 29, 2022, Press release pictureAccording to a recent McKinsey report, companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25 percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile-up from 21 percent in 2017 and 15 percent in 2014. What's more, the greater the representation, the higher the likelihood of outperformance. Companies with more than 30 percent women executives were more likely to outperform companies where this percentage ranged from 10 to 30.""Ensuring you expose, understand and make decisions based on your data and the deeper story it tells will allow you to create the inclusive culture you desire while realizing the powerful benefits of a diverse workforce.""Ernest W. Marshall, Jr., Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources OfficerAlthough we may know the potential benefits of building a diverse team, how do we ensure we are on the right path to attracting, developing and retaining one? How can we ensure we intentionally and equitably advance historically underrepresented people? Although the answer may be simple, it takes some finesse: to uncover the story, we must expose our data.But first, a caution. There's an art and a science to this. I want to warn you that data alone will never be enough. Though numbers are part of the science, insight from those numbers takes a kind of art-and you need the two together. Raw data alone never tells you everything you need to know. For that, you must peel back the layers.In years past, a company's leaders or board might have been presented with analytics, percentages and attrition rates of employees to make decisions. Yet, this reporting likely never painted a complete picture for them. The view was obstructed. Think about it; what if you only looked at the growth numbers of your women hires? If you never coupled those figures with those who were leaving, you might have thought your representation was good-because you never factored in those walking out the door. It gets much more complex than that, but you get the point.Story continuesTo put this into context, at Eaton, we aim to increase the representation of our professional workforce of global women to 40% and U.S. minorities to 34% by 2030. (See Eaton's 2020 Global Inclusion and Diversity Transparency Report). And to achieve it, we know we must fully understand the barriers and challenges that are getting in our way. So, we've made it a practice to look at who we hire and why some may be leaving. We examine things such as pay equity, learning and development opportunities and even the hiring patterns of our interns to make better decisions that strengthen our bench of talent.Getting here didn't happen overnight. It took some time and even more planning across the enterprise. As a new CHRO with Eaton just a few years back, I was fortunate to have the flexibility to build a team that had deep data engineering and statistics expertise. And over time, we have methodically moved our organization from pure reporting to delivering insightful data analysis allowing us to introduce intentional and focused solutions. We now have a far more profound understanding of where to direct our efforts to drive sustainable change.I can also attest that we are now providing our board of directors with what they need to make evidence-based choices affecting our workforce. Better decisions, by the way, which are not just better because of what we are providing them-but because our board is diverse too. Today, more than half of Eaton's board is comprised of women and U.S. minorities.I have often said that if business leaders are not intentionally inclusive, they are unintentionally exclusive. If we are not purposeful in driving equity, access and fairness across our companies, we deny it to those who deserve it. Ensuring you expose, understand and make decisions based on your data and the deeper story it tells will allow you to create the inclusive culture you desire while realizing the powerful benefits of a diverse workforce.By no means are we at the end of our journey. We are not even close. But we are closer to achieving our aspirational goal of becoming a model of inclusion and diversity in our industry than at any other point in Eaton's history. And we're better equipped to make the decisions we need to make to get there, with the data we need to help guide us on our way.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Eaton on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: EatonWebsite: https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/sustainability.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: EatonView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/729295/Want-To-Advance-Inclusion-and-Diversity-Dont-Just-Show-the-Data-Expose-the-Data]"

If you want to read about some more consumer stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider.Consumer stocks are generally considered one of the safest investments at the stock market because of their predictable business models and relatively lower price volatility as compared to other sectors of the economy. Some examples of consumer industries include food and beverage producers, household item manufacturers, personal care product manufacturers, and tobacco companies. The consumer industry is also highly consolidated in nature, a key driver of demand for the sector in a volatile macro environment. Some of the top firms in this space are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). In the past few months, even as inflation impacts the short-term spending trends, there is a belief among experts that this sentiment might weigh on manufacturing stocks longer than expected. However, the long-term growth indicators for the industry remain overwhelmingly positive, making the sector a top retirement stock portfolio pick.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the consumer sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Retirement Stock Portfolio: 11 Safe Consumer Stocks to ConsiderPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashRetirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Consumer Stocks to Consider11.

Story continuesThe firm has paid a dividend to shareholders for more than three decades. In the past ten years, this payout has registered consistent growth. On October 27, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery maintained a Neutral rating on Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stock and lowered the price target to $68 from $79, noting that the consumer demand in an inflationary environment remains at risk and falling prices will affect the firm’s chicken and beef segments.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 35 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.1 billion in Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), compared to 37 in the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion. Just like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo, Inc.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52  Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates as a general merchandise retailer in the United States. It is one of the top safe consumer stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 26, Target Corporation revealed an expanded collaboration with Apple which includes a threefold increase in Apple at Target locations. The company said that it is offering the members of its loyalty program access to a four-month free trial of Apple Fitness+ with no purchase required. Target Corp has a dividend history stretching back more than fifty years. On August 18, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli maintained a Hold rating on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock and raised the price target to $165 from $150, noting that the company’s second quarter sales were in-line, but its earnings were still below the twice-revised forecast amid heavily marked down inventory clearing activity.  At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 52 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2 billion in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $1.3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat-footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters (…read more)9. The TJX Companies, Inc.

(NYSE:TJX) stock and raised the price target to $80 from $77, noting that the off-price retailers’ operating margins are below pre-Covid levels because of the volatile retail operating environment. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm BlueSpruce Investments is a leading shareholder in The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) with 5.4 million shares worth more than $332.3 million.  In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the U.S. and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes.”8.

Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Lowe’s Companies, Inc.

The FDA target action date is March 30, 2023.HoFH is an ultra-rare inherited condition that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the U.S. and is the most severe form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The disease occurs when two copies of the FH-causing genes are inherited, one from each parent, resulting in dangerously high levels (usually &gt;400 mg/dL) of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C or bad cholesterol). Those living with HoFH are at risk for premature atherosclerotic disease and cardiac events even in their teenage years.The sBLA is supported by data from a three-part trial evaluating Evkeeza in children aged 5 to 11 years with HoFH. Efficacy was assessed in 14 children enrolled in the Part B portion of the trial. Despite treatment with other lipid-lowering therapies, these children entered the trial with an average LDL-C level of 264 mg/dL, more than twice the target (&lt;110 mg/dL) for pediatric patients with HoFH. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing children who added Evkeeza to other lipid-lowering therapies reduced their LDL-C by 48% at week 24 on average. Furthermore, 79% (n=11) saw their LDL-C reduced by at least half at 24 weeks following Evkeeza treatment, with an average absolute reduction in LDL-C from baseline of 132 mg/dL.Among 20 children evaluated for long-term safety across Parts A, B and C of the trial (mean exposure: 52 weeks, range: 42-64 weeks), the most common adverse events (AEs) occurring in ≥15% of patients included COVID-19 (n=15), pyrexia (n=5), headache (n=4), throat pain (oropharyngeal pain, n=4) as well as upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis and cough (all n=3). Most reported AEs were mild or moderate, and none led to study discontinuation. The safety profile of Evkeeza observed in these patients was generally consistent to those seen in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.Story continuesEvkeeza is the first angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) targeted therapy approved by the FDA, European Commission and the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency as an adjunct therapy for patients aged 12 years and older with HoFH. The potential use of Evkeeza in HoFH patients aged 5 to 11 years has not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the TrialThe three-part, single-arm, open-label trial evaluated Evkeeza in pediatric patients with HoFH aged 5 to 11 years. Part A (n=6) was a Phase 1b trial designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of Evkeeza.Efficacy was evaluated in the 24-week treatment period in the Phase 3 Part B portion, which enrolled 14 patients with an average age of 9 years. Among them, 86% were on statins, 93% were on ezetimibe, 50% were on LDL apheresis and 14% were on lomitapide. Patients received Evkeeza 15 mg/kg every four weeks delivered intravenously alongside their lipid-lowering treatment regimen. The primary endpoint was change in LDL-C at week 24. Secondary endpoints included the effect of Evkeeza on other lipid parameters (i.e., apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein[a] and total cholesterol), efficacy by mutation status, safety and tolerability, immunogenicity and PK.Patients who completed Part A or B were allowed to continue treatment in Part C (n=20), an ongoing Phase 3 extension trial. Parts A, B and C were not designed to evaluate the effect of Evkeeza on cardiovascular events.About Evkeeza® (evinacumab)Evkeeza was invented using Regeneron's VelocImmune® technology and is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the function of ANGPTL3, a protein that inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL) and regulates circulating lipids, including LDL-C.Regeneron scientists discovered the angiopoietin gene family more than two decades ago. Human genetics research published in New England Journal of Medicine in 2017 by scientists from the Regeneron Genetics Center® found that patients whose ANGPTL3 gene did not function properly (called a ""loss-of function mutation"") have significantly lower levels of key blood lipids, including LDL-C, and that this is associated with a significantly lower risk of coronary artery disease.The generic name for Evkeeza in its approved U.S. indications is evinacumab-dgnb, with dgnb the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA. The safety and effectiveness of Evkeeza have not been established in patients with other causes of hypercholesterolemia, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The effect of Evkeeza on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.Regeneron is responsible for the development and distribution of Evkeeza in the U.S. and is collaborating with Ultragenyx to clinically develop, commercialize and distribute Evkeeza outside of the U.S.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb), REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR EVKEEZA® (evinacumab-dgnb) INJECTIONWho should not use EVKEEZA?Do not use EVKEEZA if you are allergic to evinacumab-dgnb or to any of the ingredients in EVKEEZA.Before receiving EVKEEZA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Does Growth Match The P/E?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 24% decrease to the company's bottom line. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 155% in total over the last three years. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 7.1% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 9.1% each year, which paints a poor picture.With this information, we find it concerning that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. Apparently many investors in the company reject the analyst cohort's pessimism and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals currently trades on a higher than expected P/E for a company whose earnings are forecast to decline. When we see a poor outlook with earnings heading backwards, we suspect share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

Why should Congress help them?,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-greedy-railroads-blame-rail-204531674.html,1669754731,STORY,['UNP'],"[Freight train cars at a Union Pacific yard in City of Commerce. With a majority of rail workers balking at a contract negotiated with railroads under the eye of the Biden administration, a rail strike looms. (Ashley Landis / Associated Press)The prevailing take on the looming national rail crisis is that a few recalcitrant railroad unions are poised go on strike Dec. 9, provoking an industrywide labor walkout that would inflict a ""crippling"" blow to the U.S. economy.The quoted word comes from President Biden, who on Monday called on Congress to impose a contract on the workers and avert the strike.His concern was echoed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who indicated that her chamber is ready to do so. In the Senate, both Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have expressed willingness to go along.Few, if any, workers have more power over the economy than transportation workers.Labor historian Erik LoomisSince Biden is known as firmly pro-labor to an extent not seen in the White House in nine decades, and Pelosi's Democratic Party is generally favorable to organized labor, you might think they're right to put the onus on the unions.You would be wrong.The truth is that the rail strike is being provoked by railroad managements that have absolutely refused to give in on a central goal of the rail unions: the provision of paid sick leave. The contract Biden wants to impose was negotiated by union leaders and railroad managements under the eye of the Biden administration. It requires one paid sick day per year, in an industry in which some leading companies don't provide any.Meanwhile, the railroads are absolutely swimming in profits — more than enough to have satisfied the unions' demand and have tens of billions of dollars left over.Pelosi says the House will vote Wednesday on whether to add seven sick days per year to the tentative contract. But that will happen only after the House votes on whether to impose the contract, and it will be a separate vote. This is an arrangement that reduces any leverage the workers had, to force more sick day into the contract, to nil.Back in September, Biden celebrated what looked like a victory for railroad workers — a contract that gave workers a raise of some 24% over its five-year term, negotiated with White House help.Story continuesSince then, however, members of four of the 12 rail unions involved in the negotiations have rejected the deal. Since all 12 must approve the contract for it to go into effect, the rejections mean a strike is looming.In his statement Monday calling on Congress to step in, Biden noted that ""the majority of the unions in the industry have voted to approve the deal."" That's misleading, however. The four holdouts represent 60,000 of the 115,000 unionized employees. In other words, although a majority of the unions have approved the contract, a majority of the workers have not. They should have our support.During negotiations earlier this year under the eye of the emergency board Biden appointed in May, the unions sought at least 15 days of paid sick leave, with unused days available to carry over to subsequent years without limit.The railroads balked. The union proposal would cost $688 million a year, they said. Ultimately they agreed to one paid sick day a year, plus any number of unpaid days, in the contract.The unions rightly saw this provision as an insult. In global terms, it certainly was. The U.S. is one of only 11 United Nations member countries that provides no government-mandated sick leave. As I observed in 2020, that places America in an elite group that includes the Pacific Island nations of Tonga, Tuvalu and Nauru, along with Somalia.The need for consistent sick leave policies was placed in stark relief by the pandemic, when sick workers were forced to continue working under conditions that threatened to amplify the spread of the COVID-19 virus to customers and co-workers.The congressional solution to that crisis was meager: The initial pandemic relief measure — the Families First Coronavirus Response Act enacted in March 2020 — provided for two employer-paid weeks of emergency medical leave, but exempted businesses with 500 employees or more and allowed small businesses with fewer than 50 workers to claim hardship exemptions.Some railroad companies were notorious for punitive time-off and scheduling policies. Among them was BNSF, the giant carrier owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. BNSF's old system required workers to be on call 75% of the time; a policy implemented in January required them to be on call 90% of the time.Union officials called the new system ""the worst and most egregious attendance policy ever adopted by any rail carrier” and said that 700 workers quit before the company ended the policy in June.How devastating would be the cost of 15 sick days a year? Not devastating at all. Let's look at the numbers.The major railroads are earning carloads of profits. Union Pacific boasted in January that 2021 had been its ""most profitable year ever,"" with $6.5 billion in net income after tax. The good times have continued to roll, with $5.4 billion recorded in the first nine months of this year.BNSF reported $6 billion in profit last year and $4.5 billion through Sept. 30 this year. CSX reported $3.7 billion in profit last year and $3.1 billion through Sept. 30.Those profits were plenty big enough to fund some $196 billion in stock buybacks and dividends — handouts to shareholders — from 2010 through 2020. The companies continued to shell out for buybacks and dividends by the billions last year and this year, all while whining about the much lower annual cost of sick leave for employees.Top executives, by the way, shared the wealth. Lance M. Fritz, chief executive of Union Pacific, received $14.5 million in compensation last year, 162 times the average employee pay at the company. At CSX, the compensation of CEO James M. Foote rose more than 30% last year to $20 million from $15.3 million. The CEO-to-worker ratio there was 186 to 1.It's true that a rail strike would have severe consequences for the economy. It could be felt in millions of households, through higher prices for shipped foodstuffs and other goods and commodities, as well as possible layoffs in sectors reliant on rail shipments.That's the whole point of strikes — to impose economic pain in order to generate pressure for settlement. This is almost the only leverage that organized labor enjoys. It's a categoric error to interpret that leverage as something that absolves employers of their responsibilities to negotiate fairly.News coverage of this dispute, as it is in almost all labor disputes, depicts the unions and their members as the active parties.As the great press critic A.J. Liebling observed during a newspaper strike in 1963, the press traditionally presents union goals as ""demands"" and employer goals as ""offers,"" when it would be just as accurate to say that employers are demanding that workers accept their policies and the union members offer their work at a given price.In this case, obviously, the railroads could avert a strike by coming to the table with a more accommodating sick leave policy, or ""demand.""U.S. laws, including that statute that Biden has asked Congress to activate, generally put their thumbs on the scale in favor of employers. As labor historian Erik Loomis has noted, ""few, if any, workers have more power over the economy than transportation workers.""As a result, strikes and threatened strikes in that sector have traditionally resulted in the extreme exercise of government authority.The best example was the Pullman Sleeping Car strike of 1894, which was provoked by the monstrously closefisted George Pullman and was poised to expand into a nationwide rail strike. (Pullman laid off huge numbers of his employees and cut pay but refused to reduce rent on the houses he owned in his company town.)President Grover Cleveland, whose Cabinet was stocked with moonlighting railroad lawyers, called out the military to quell the strike and put the railroad union leader, Eugene V. Debs, in jail, turning Debs into a national figure.Although federal laws such as the Railway Labor Act of 1926 were typically presented as instruments of labor peace, in the current context they may have guaranteed that the railroads would hold fast to contract terms they knew would sow discontent among their workforce, and staffing reductions that make railroad work more hazardous.But they were confident that, if push came to shove, the federal government would intervene on their side to keep the trains rolling. That's what's happening, with the deadline of Dec. 9 looming.As Biden said, the secretaries of Transportation, Agriculture and Labor have all come to the conclusion that ""there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table and have recommended that we seek congressional action."" Thanks to the prospect of congressional action, the railroad workers are destined to lose. But don't make the mistake of thinking that they're the guilty parties.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

GPS has been gaining from sturdy demand and strength in the Athleta brand. Its cost-cutting actions bode well. This led to third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, both metrics improved year over year.Results gained from sturdy demand for formal clothing and dresses, as people are preferring more formal clothing, dresses, woven tops and pants, and shelving casual wear as they return to travel, work and social occasions after two years of the pandemic.Adjusted earnings of 71 cents per share compared favorably with earnings of 27 cents in third-quarter fiscal 2021. Net sales rose 2% year over year to $4,039 million. The metric also grew 1% from the pre-pandemic level. Comparable sales (comps) inched up 1% on a year-over-year basis.We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have risen 53.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 5.4% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research That said, let’s delve deeper into the factors driving the stock.A Brief IntrospectionContinued momentum across its Athleta brand has been acting as a key growth driver for long. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales.In third-quarter fiscal 2022, net sales jumped 6% to $340 million for the Athleta brand, while the metric grew 57% from the pre-pandemic levels. Comps remained flat year over year.Segmental results gained from positive responses for fall and holiday products, particularly in bottoms and tops. Increased focus on performance active, as well as active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends, bodes well. It has also emerged as one of the fastest-growing women's athleisure brands in North America. Driven by these factors, Athleta remains on track to reach $2 billion in net sales by fiscal 2023.The company has been aggressively undertaking cost-management actions in the fiscal third quarter. Some notable efforts are the elimination of 500 existing and open positions in its corporate offices, a hiring freeze, a pause on contractor spend for the rest of the year, the renegotiation of advertising agency contracts, reduced technology and operating costs, and rationalized investments. This resulted in roughly $250 million in estimated annualized savings. Such endeavors are likely to help offset higher incentive compensation and rising labor costs in fiscal 2023.Gap is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores. As part of the plan, the company expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute 70% to sales by 2023.Notably, the company closed 29 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America in the nine months ending Oct 29, 2022. It expects to close 30 more in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023.Story continuesHurdles on the WayGap has been reeling under longer transit times, more delays, pack-and-hold strategies, and elevated levels of slow-turning basics and seasonal products. Management expects inventory to remain high in the fiscal fourth quarter due to remaining fall products despite higher markdowns in the reported quarter.Huge discounts and elevated commodity prices dented margins in the fiscal third quarter. Notably, the adjusted gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) year over year, whereas the adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps year over year.Management expects sales to decline year over year in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. This might result from the continued uncertain consumer environment and higher promotions.The company raised concerns about a drab holiday season this year. Also, rising prices of essential commodities are likely to continue to hurt lower-income consumers' spending on non-essentials like apparel.Bottom LineAll said, strength in Gap’s Athleta brand, cost-management efforts and the Power Plan 2023 strategy are likely to help it sustain its momentum despite cost woes. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% raises optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked stocks to consider, namely Wingstop WING, Dollar General DG and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.Wingstop currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Suggests It's 33% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-cisco-systems-inc-110054514.html,1669806054,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$14.6bUS$16.0bUS$15.7bUS$16.3bUS$16.9bUS$17.3bUS$17.6bUS$18.0bUS$18.3bUS$18.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.02%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2%Est @ 1.99%Est @ 1.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$13.7kUS$14.0kUS$12.7kUS$12.3kUS$12.0kUS$11.4kUS$10.8kUS$10.3kUS$9.8kUS$9.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$116bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$364bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$364b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$181bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$297b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$48.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.023. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?
