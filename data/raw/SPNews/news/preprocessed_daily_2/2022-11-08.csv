(NASDAQ:VRSK)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-verisk-analytics-140741413.html,1667830061,STORY,['VRSK'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$946.0mUS$997.3mUS$1.04bUS$1.07bUS$1.10bUS$1.13bUS$1.16bUS$1.19bUS$1.21bUS$1.24bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.67%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.22%Est @ 2.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$888US$879US$859US$834US$806US$777US$748US$719US$690US$662(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.9bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$28bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$28b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$15bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$23b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$167, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Verisk Analytics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.878. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Verisk Analytics, we've put together three additional aspects you should explore:Risks: For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Verisk Analytics (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does VRSK's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

4,e5c7d83d-44e1-3ce4-b6a2-a503b781fcb4,SCHW,2022-11-08,Is Schwab Fundamental International Large Company Index ETF (FNDF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-international-large-company-112011481.html,1667820011,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Launched on 08/13/2013, the Schwab Fundamental International Large Company Index ETF (FNDF) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Charles Schwab. FNDF has been able to amass assets over $7.75 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Developed ex US Large Co. Index (Net) before fees and expenses.The Russell RAFI Developed ex US Large Company Index (Net) measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores, which are created using as the universe the companies included in the Russell Developed ex-U.S. Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Story continuesWith one of the cheaper products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.25%.FNDF's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 4.21%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Shell Plc (SHEL) accounts for about 3.30% of the fund's total assets, followed by Bp Plc (BP.) and Samsung Electronics Ltd.The top 10 holdings account for about 11.52% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -14.68% and is down about -14.94% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 11/07/2022), respectively. FNDF has traded between $25.15 and $34.12 during this last 52-week period.FNDF has a beta of 0.84 and standard deviation of 23.80% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 970 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Large Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) tracks FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) tracks FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF has $45.49 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF has $91.40 billion. VXUS has an expense ratio of 0.07% and VEA charges 0.05%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is depicted in the graph below:Evolution Petroleum Corporation, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEvolution Petroleum Corporation, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEvolution Petroleum Corporation, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Evolution Petroleum Corporation, Inc. QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of 38 cents has witnessed no revisions in the past seven days. The estimated figure suggests an improvement of 137.5% from the prior-year number.Factors to ConsiderPer data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the average West Texas Intermediate crude prices in July, August and September were recorded at $101.62 per barrel, $93.67 per barrel and $84.26 per barrel, respectively. In comparison, in the year-ago respective months, average oil prices were reported at $72.49 per barrel, $67.73 per barrel and $71.65 per barrel, per the EIA’s data.Higher oil price was favorable for the exploration and production activities of Evolution. Natural gas price was also healthier, thereby favoring EPM’s exploration and production businesses. These are likely to have aided the company’s bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Evolution this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

(NYSE:AYI), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Acuity Brands’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Acuity Brands What Is Acuity Brands Worth?Great news for investors – Acuity Brands is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $259.88, but it is currently trading at US$181 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Acuity Brands’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Acuity Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 10% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Acuity Brands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since AYI is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AYI for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy AYI. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Acuity Brands from their most recent forecasts.

(NYSE:AYI) contributed to portfolio performance as the Company continued to generate strong revenue growth while protecting margins in the face of a particularly difficult inflationary environment. The Company’s fiscal fourth quarter results (released in early October) reflected +12% revenue growth with over +15% adjusted operating margins that are near all-time highs from a year ago. Acuity is managing inflationary pressure by constantly re-engineering their lighting and control products while also enacting more than a half-dozen price increases over the past 2 years. The Company’s backlog continues to build as commercial office, education and industrial facilities owners invest in much needed renovations. The secular move toward more energy-efficient commercial lighting solutions is a long-term driver for Acuity products. For example, California recently banned the sale of compact and linear fluorescent lamps. Although Acuity does not sell lightbulbs, it stands to benefit from future demand for luminaires and lighting controls for LED units that will inevitably replace these fixtures.""Story continuesSmall-Cap AI StocksPhoto by lucas law on UnsplashAcuity Brands, Inc.

11,f82027b5-405b-3804-b2c8-dbd11b8a3394,USB,2022-11-08,"With 68% institutional ownership, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/68-institutional-ownership-u-bancorp-110019277.html,1667905219,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 68% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about U.S. Bancorp. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of U.S. Bancorp. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$87m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 8.1% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Results benefited from strong performances by EEFT’s EFT Processing, epay and Money Transfer segments.

Total transactions climbed 48% year over year to 1,733 million in the third quarter, while the consensus mark for the same stood at 1,683 million.The segmental performance was driven by better domestic and international withdrawal transactions resulting from the continued rebound in travel. Other factors, such as the buyout of Piraeus Bank's merchant-acquiring business leading to improved point-of-sale revenues and with higher volume in low-priced payment processing transactions within the Asia Pacific also contributed to the strong segmental performance.Story continuesThe epay segment reported revenues of $248.9 million in the quarter under review, which grew 4% year over year or 18% on a constant-currency basis. The figure was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $230 million.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $30.5 million, up 8% year over year or 24% on a constant-currency basis.Operating income of $29.1 million improved 12% year over year or 29% on a constant-currency basis.Transactions witnessed a 13% year-over-year increase to 915 million but were lower than the consensus mark of 1,040 million.The segment was aided by digital branded payments and mobile growth, and an expanding digital distribution channel.The Money Transfer segment’s total revenues of $364.9 million rose 3% year over year (up 11% on a constant-currency basis) in the third quarter. Revenue growth was led by 14% and 12% in U.S.-outbound transactions and international-originated money transfers, respectively.

Her work is energized by an abiding love for unstructured play and the creativity and empathy that can bloom from it.As one of the three main pillars of the U.S. Bank Community Possible platform, Play, is a quality which brings joy and vibrancy to communities, but in low-income areas there are often limited spaces for play and fewer people attending arts and cultural events. That's why Erica and her team look for opportunities to invest in community programming that allows children and adults to play and create.In Erica's hometown of San Diego, one organization specifically, The New Children's Museum, has captured the hearts and minds of the Opstad family, including Erica's son, Blake, and her husband, Keith, an award-winning artist and art educator who is also an appointed commissioner for the City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture. The museum's motto is ""Think, Play, Create,"" and Erica is a part of the museums board of directors, while the entire Opstad family are longtime supporters and fans.In 2022, under the guidance of San Diego Community Affairs Manager Rockette Ewell, the U.S. Bank Foundation awarded The New Children's Museum a three-year. $105,000 grant to help fund visits to the Museum through a wide array of access programs, including:Story continuesSummer Camps: U.S. Bank will fund 12 camp scholarships each year for three years, allowing children from low-income families to attend the Museum's week-long arts-based day camps.Social Service Organization Visits: Children and families utilizing San Diego social service organizations serving children coping with abuse, homelessness, domestic violence, illness, and disabilities are part of a program that includes group visits, special workshops, free admission and other programming, including Mass Creativity Day, a free annual festival which celebrates these partnerships at the Museum.Museums for All: This program allows families receiving federal assistance through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, aka food stamps) and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs admission to the Museum for just $2/person and the ability to purchase annual memberships for $40.Title I School Visits: Title I is a federal education program that supports low-income students, as determined by the number of students who qualify for free or reduced lunch. Through the Museum's access programs, students from Title I schools come for field trips at no cost to them.Accessibility Mornings: Free access for families in need of a sensory-friendly experience.Discover &amp; Go Library Program: Offers San Diego Public Library cardholders a free pass to visit the museum.Military: The Museum provides active-duty military and their families free admission from Armed Forces Day through Labor Day through the national Blue Star Museums program. The Museum also provides discounted military admission the remainder of the year.In addition to funding access programs, U.S. Bank employees, like Erica and Rockette, volunteer at the Museum regularly. Recent activity includes a large group participating in Mass Creativity Day, the Museum's long-running community engagement program, in partnership with multiple community-based organizations throughout the county.Learn more about the support of U.S. Bank Foundation in this news segment, or hear more from Erica and Keith about their personal support of the museum via StoryCorps.Learn more about U.S. Bank hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724238/Superhero-Inspired-Support-of-Unstructured-Play-in-San-Diego]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has lost 7.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $4.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.43 points to a change of +358.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.06 indicates a change of -17.4% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For CF, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.68 billion and $9.85 billion estimates indicate +78.6% and -15.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WMT, The Kroger Co. KR and Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao CBD.Industry: SupermarketLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2014575/3-supermarket-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-concernsPlayers in the Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry are grappling with elevated cost concerns and supply-chain bottlenecks. Increased raw material, transportation and warehouse costs have been hurting the margins of several industry participants. A challenging macroeconomic landscape is also a concern.Nonetheless, continued efforts to enhance store and online operations have been working well. Robust efforts to boost omnichannel operations keep Walmart Inc., The Kroger Co. and Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao well placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry includes supermarket retailers, which offer grocery, health and beauty aids, household chemicals, electronics, stationery, automotive accessories, hardware and paint, sporting goods, fabrics and crafts, entertainment products, home furnishings and much more. Players in this industry operate through various formats such as supermarkets, multi-department stores, retail stores, discount stores, supercenters, hypermarkets and warehouse clubs.Nevertheless, food retail accounts for a chunk of their business. The industry has undergone a significant transformation over the years, with e-commerce playing a strong role. Given consumers’ rising preference for online shopping, industry participants have been enhancing pickup and delivery services as well as offering easy payment options.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Supermarkets IndustrySupply-Chain Bottlenecks &amp; Margin Woes:  The industry is dealing with supply-chain disruptions, rising freight charges as well as labor shortages. Due to supply issues across the world, companies have been witnessing inventory delays, product shortages and manufacturing delays. Rising raw material costs, increased transportation costs, higher wages and elevated warehouse costs have been hurting the margins of players in the industry.Story continuesApart from this, companies’ constant technological investments to bolster online operations, and costs related to employee benefits pose a threat to margins. Continued price investments and other promotion activities also come at the cost of margins.Tough Macroeconomic Landscape: A tough macroeconmic environment, marked by heightened inflation, has been weighing on consumer spending, thereby limiting shopping capacity. Continuation of these trends may hurt demand (particularly for discretionary products) and lead to reduced average ticket size, especially during the holiday season.Solid Omnichannel Efforts: Supermarket retailers have been firing on all cylinders to strengthen operations – both in stores and online. To this end, they have been focused on store improvisation, merchandise enhancement, prudent pricing strategy and efforts to replenish assortments.Additionally, companies have been pushing the edge out of the envelope to bolster online operations. In fact, pandemic-led social distancing has taken online shopping to another level – causing industry players to constantly step up their efforts in this arena through meaningful buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. In this regard, companies have been benefiting from their same-day delivery, buy online and pick-up in-store, curbside pickup as well as contactless payment options.Despite an improvement in-store traffic with things getting back to normal and people stepping out, online shopping remains popular. Companies’ concerted efforts to unite store and online operations to offer customers a solid omnichannel experience certainly keep them well placed for growth.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Drab ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail - Wholesale sector.

21,8ffbe849-17b0-3dee-8e50-2ffb59697e89,WMT,2022-11-08,12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-blue-chip-stocks-175815259.html,1667843895,STORY,"['GE', 'JPM', 'HD', 'PG', 'JNJ', 'DIS', 'WMT']","[In this article, we will take a look at 12 of the best blue chip stocks to buy today. If you want to see more of the best blue chip stocks to buy today, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.2022 has been a challenging year for many stocks in the market.Given the high inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year and many analysts think the central bank will raise the rate even further.With the higher interest rates, the U.S. consumer has less spending power and consumer demand is lower. With lower demand, companies are not investing as much, especially given that the cost of debt is also higher.Similarly, the rising interest rates have increased U.S. Treasury yields substantially and the higher Treasury yields have made stocks less attractive to some investors.As a result of the headwinds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 11.4% year to date while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 21.4% year to date. The NASDAQ has fallen the most, declining almost 34% year to date.Like the Dow Jones, many blue chip stocks have declined substantially in terms of their stock prices year to date. Given that many blue chip companies have strong competitive advantages and growth potential, however, some leading blue chips could be good buys in terms of long term investments as valuations potentially return closer to normal if the Federal Reserve successfully contains inflation.In the near term, however, there is uncertainty even for blue chips if economic data fails to meet expectations. Many analysts think there could be a recession next year and the Federal Reserve has signaled it isn't done raising rates.In addition to rising rates domestically, the international economy could face headwinds given that China's exports fell in October for the first time in over two years. With China's exports falling 0.3% in October in dollar terms year over year, global aggregate demand could be potentially weaker than expected.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that we think have upside in terms of the long term given their competitive advantages and growth potential. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 blue chips stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stocks at the end of Q2 2022.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today12. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is an industrial conglomerate whose shares declined in 2020 due to the pandemic, which weakened demand for GE aviation. With the interest rate increases and the broader market weakness, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) shares have declined again by slightly over 14% year to date in 2022. Nevertheless, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has quality businesses and quality earnings power that could give the stock upside in the long term.Longleaf Partners commented on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a blue chip stock that's owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Although Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is down around 2.57% year to date, the company's stock has done a lot better than the three major indexes as the leading retailer has benefited from more demand. Given the higher inflation, more consumers are looking for the best prices, and often Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stores are among the most competitive. If it can maintain its market share and keep its new customers, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) could continue to grow earnings for the future.10. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71As a maker of premium consumer staple brands, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been negatively affected by higher inflation. As a result, shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have declined by 17.8% year to date. Nevertheless, there's hope that the Federal Reserve will successfully win its battle against inflation in a year or two. If that happens, demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) premium brands could normalize again.9. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80Given the interest rate increases, the 30 year fixed mortgage rate is around 7.23% or more than double what it was a year ago. Given the higher mortgage rates, demand for homes has decreased, and demand for home improvement products has weakened too. As a result, leading home improvement retailer The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stock has fallen 31.6% year to date. Although interest rates could go higher before they go lower, there's hope the Federal Reserve will win its battle against inflation. If that happens, interest rates could normalize and demand for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) could normalize too. Currently shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) trade for a forward P/E ratio of 16.4, which could be an attractive valuation if the company grows EPS at the rate that analysts expect in the next five years.8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83 Although the broader market might have declined substantially in 2022, shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are up around 0.24% year to date. In the longer term, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is also in an uptrend as the company continues to grow earnings per share given its innovative products and the pricing power of its consumer brands. Currently shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) trade for a forward P/E of 16.5, which is pretty attractive given the company's competitive advantages and earnings power.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has benefited from the higher interest rates with higher net interest income, which rose 51% year over year in the third quarter. While JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s net interest income rose, the bank's net profit nevertheless fell 17% given it set aside $808 million in reserves. If there is a recession next year, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is among the best prepared banks given its balance sheet. In the long term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has upside given its quality earnings potential.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares are down 35.7% year to date given some of the company's businesses such as its theme parks are pretty economically sensitive. Disney+'s valuation has also decreased in 2022 given the decline of Netflix's valuation this year. Nevertheless, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has many high quality businesses that will likely increase in value in the long term if they maintain their market share.Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are blue chip stocks that are owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.Suggested articles:22 Biggest Economies in the World in 202215 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market CapDisclosure: None. 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

27,52564c10-8dfd-3760-8cb4-4cef27c469d0,MGM,2022-11-08,Insiders at MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) snagged a bargain: a US$104k profit on a US$1.9m buy,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-mgm-resorts-international-nyse-191408809.html,1667848448,STORY,['MGM'],"[Insiders who bought MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) in the last 12 months may probably not pay attention to the stock's recent 5.9% drop. After taking the recent loss into consideration, the US$1.9m worth of stock they bought is now worth US$2.0m, indicating that their investment yielded a positive return.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International MGM Resorts International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Chairman Paul Salem for US$998k worth of shares, at about US$28.92 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$33.84. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.9m for 57.86k shares. But insiders sold 32.39k shares worth US$1.5m. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by MGM Resorts International insiders. They paid about US$32.05 on average. It's great to see insiders putting their own cash into the company's stock, albeit at below the recent share price. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeMGM Resorts International is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insiders At MGM Resorts International Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significantly more insider buying, than insider selling, at MGM Resorts International. We can see that Independent Director Janet Swartz paid US$499k for shares in the company. On the other hand, Independent Director Daniel Taylor netted US$155k by selling. We think insiders may be optimistic about the future, since insiders have been net buyers of shares.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of MGM Resorts InternationalFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.7% of MGM Resorts International shares, worth about US$92m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Do The MGM Resorts International Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest MGM Resorts International insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for MGM Resorts International you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.But note: MGM Resorts International may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE: NCLH) (together with NCL Corporation Ltd., “Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings”, “Norwegian” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022 and provided a business update.Highlights:GAAP net loss of $(295.4) million or EPS of $(0.70) and Adjusted Net Loss of $(268.3) million or Adjusted EPS of $(0.64).1Reached positive Adjusted EBITDA milestone in the third quarter of 2022.Sequential Occupancy improvement to approximately 82% in the quarter, consistent with guidance.Total revenue per Passenger Cruise Day exceeded expectations, increasing approximately 14% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2019.On track to generate positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the fourth quarter of 2022.2023 cumulative booked position equal to record 2019 levels at significantly higher pricing.Reaffirm expectation for record Adjusted EBITDA and record Net Yield for FY 2023.“We are demonstrating continued positive momentum as we consistently reach key operational and financial milestones, including positive Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The underlying fundamentals of our business and our target upmarket consumer remain strong and our strategy of focusing on maximizing long-term, sustainable profitability is working as intended, evidenced by our 2023 booked position which is equal to 2019’s record levels and at record pricing,” said Frank Del Rio, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “We believe we are uniquely positioned within the cruise space to unlock value for our stakeholders given our dominance as the leading operator in upscale experiences, our sizeable yet nimble 29-ship fleet, our industry-best growth profile and our differentiated go-to-market strategy of market-to-fill and value-add bundling.”Story continuesOperations Update The Company continued its phased ramp-up in the third quarter focusing on maximizing long-term pricing, which resulted in a 17-point improvement in Occupancy to approximately 82%, consistent with previously outlined expectations. The Company continues to expect quarterly Occupancy levels to increase and reach historical levels for the second quarter of 2023. Given fourth quarter Occupancy is typically lower due to seasonality, we expect Occupancy to be in the mid-to-high 80 percent range, but with the gap versus 2019 levels expected to further narrow.Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation resulted in better-than-expected total revenue per Passenger Cruise Day which was up approximately 14% in the third quarter of 2022 versus 2019, higher than guidance for a high-single digits increase and despite the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced Baltic itineraries. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company expects total revenue per Passenger Cruise Day to increase approximately 20% versus 2019.The Company reached another significant financial inflection point by generating positive Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $28 million for the third quarter of 2022. The Company continues to target positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the fourth quarter of 2022 and slightly positive Adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2022. In addition, the Company continues to target exceeding historical record Net Yield and Adjusted EBITDA levels for full year 2023 and a return to Adjusted Net Income in 2023.Booking Environment and OutlookAs expected, the Company’s current cumulative booked position for the fourth quarter of 2022 is below the comparable 2019 period but at higher prices even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits (“FCCs”). Dilution from value-add FCCs issued during the pandemic will not carry over into 2023 as the bonus portion of these FCCs expire at year-end 2022.Booking trends for full year 2023 remain positive with cumulative booked position equal to record 2019 levels inclusive of the Company’s increase in capacity. Pricing is significantly higher than that of 2019 at a similar point in time for full year 2023. Net booking volumes continue to be at the pace needed to reach historical Load Factor levels in 2023.As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s advance ticket sales balance, including the long-term portion, was $2.5 billion. This includes approximately $260 million of FCCs or approximately 10% of the total deposit balance. Approximately 60% of the FCC balance outstanding has been applied to future sailings. Gross advance ticket sales build was approximately $1.5 billion during the quarter, in line with the prior quarter.Liquidity and Financial Recovery PlanThe Company continues to prioritize enhancing liquidity and financial flexibility in the current environment while seeking opportunities to optimize its balance sheet and reduce leverage. As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s total debt position was $13.9 billion and the Company’s liquidity was approximately $2.2 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion and a $1 billion undrawn commitment.“We are on track to generate positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to march towards our expected return to historical occupancy levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023,” said Mark A. Kempa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “We are proactively working to further enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity, including the amendment and extension of our Operating Credit Facility which we expect to complete by year-end. We believe our ongoing cash generation, buoyed by our attractive newbuild growth pipeline, provides a path to meet our near-term liquidity needs and restore our balance sheet over time.”Third Quarter 2022 ResultsGAAP net loss was $(295.4) million or EPS of $(0.70) compared to net loss of $(845.9) million or EPS of $(2.29) in the prior year. The Company reported Adjusted Net Loss of $(268.3) million or Adjusted EPS of $(0.64) in 2022. This compares to Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS of $(801.4) million and $(2.17), respectively, in 2021.Revenue increased to $1.6 billion compared to $153.1 million in 2021 due to the phased ramp up of cruise voyages.Total cruise operating expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021, due to the continued resumption of voyages, which resulted in higher payroll, fuel, and direct variable costs of fully operating ships, compared to the prior year when only 8 ships were returned to service. Costs were also impacted by inflationary pressures and continued COVID-19 related costs, including testing.Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, increased to $830 from $693 in 2021. The Company reported fuel expense of $186.9 million in the period.Interest expense, net was $152.3 million in 2022 compared to $161.2 million in 2021. Interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower interest expense in connection with recent refinancings and higher interest income, partially offset by higher debt balances and higher rates.Other income (expense), net was income of $31.5 million in 2022 compared to $4.7 million in 2021. In 2022, the income primarily related to gains on foreign currency remeasurements.OutlookAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and current macroeconomic conditions, while the Company cannot estimate the impact on its business, financial condition or near- or longer-term financial or operational results with certainty, it will report a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company does not provide certain estimated future results on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of certain gains and charges. These items are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.FuelThe following reflects the Company’s expectations regarding fuel consumption and pricing, along with accompanying sensitivities. Fourth Quarter 2022Full Year 2022Fuel consumption in metric tons240,000870,000Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges1$725$780Effect on Adjusted EPS of a 10% changein fuel prices, net of hedges$0.02$0.022(1)   Fuel prices are based on forward curves as of 11/2/22(2)   For the remaining quarter of 2022As of September 30, 2022, the Company had hedged approximately 44% and 38% of its total projected metric tons of fuel consumption for the fourth quarter of 2022 and full year 2023, respectively.

Anticipated non-newbuild capital expenditures for full year 2022 are expected to be approximately $470 million including approximately $155 million in the fourth quarter.Newbuild-related capital expenditures, net of export credit financing, are expected to be approximately $0.7 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion for the full years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, reflecting adjusted ship delivery schedules for the third and fourth Prima Class vessels due to shipyard constraints. Net newbuild-related capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2022 are expected to be approximately $84 million.Other Guidance Occupancy is expected to be in the mid-to-high 80% range for the fourth quarter of 2022. Capacity Days are expected to be 5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Total revenue is expected to be $1.4-1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenue per Passenger Cruise Day is forecast to increase approximately 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day is expected to decrease by approximately 10% in second half of 2022 versus first half of 2022.Interest Expense, net is expected to be approximately $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and approximately $610 million for full year 2022, excluding losses on extinguishment of debt.Depreciation and Amortization is expected to be approximately $195 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $740 million for full year 2022.Adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2022 is expected to be slightly positive.The following reflects the foreign currency exchange rates the Company used in its fourth quarter 2022 guidance. Q4 2022 Guidance Euro$0.98British pound$1.12Australian Dollar$0.64Canadian Dollar$0.72Company Updates and Other Business Highlights:Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Committed $100,000 to the American Red Cross to assist in Hurricane Ian relief efforts.

See “Terminology” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yield to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and believe they are relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income (loss), we believe changes in Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.As our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income (loss), as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.In addition, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net loss and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation during normal operations. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results.Management believes Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow provide investors with useful financial metrics to assess our ability to service and repay our debt and to pursue opportunities to enhance our growth after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as they exclude certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as measures to assess both business performance and overall liquidity.You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below.Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsSome of the statements, estimates or projections contained in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained, or incorporated by reference, in this release, including, without limitation, those regarding our business strategy, financial position, results of operations, plans, prospects, actions taken or strategies being considered with respect to our liquidity position, valuation and appraisals of our assets and objectives of management for future operations (including those regarding expected fleet additions, our expectations regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and general macroeconomic conditions, our expectations regarding cruise voyage occupancy, the implementation of and effectiveness of our health and safety protocols, operational position, demand for voyages, plans or goals for our sustainability program and decarbonization efforts, our expectations for future cash flows and profitability, financing opportunities and extensions, and future cost mitigation and cash conservation efforts and efforts to reduce operating expenses and capital expenditures) are forward-looking statements. Many, but not all, of these statements can be found by looking for words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “project,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “will,” “may,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “intend,” “future” and similar words. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and may involve risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in those forward-looking statements. Examples of these risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the impact of: the spread of epidemics, pandemics and viral outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and their effect on the ability or desire of people to travel (including on cruises), which is expected to continue to adversely impact our results, operations, outlook, plans, goals, growth, reputation, cash flows, liquidity, demand for voyages and share price; implementing precautions in coordination with regulators and global public health authorities to protect the health, safety and security of guests, crew and the communities we visit and to comply with regulatory restrictions related to the pandemic; our indebtedness and restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity and be in compliance with maintenance covenants and otherwise limit our flexibility in operating our business, including the significant portion of assets that are collateral under these agreements; our ability to work with lenders and others or otherwise pursue options to defer, renegotiate, refinance or restructure our existing debt profile, near-term debt amortization, newbuild related payments and other obligations and to work with credit card processors to satisfy current or potential future demands for collateral on cash advanced from customers relating to future cruises; our need for additional financing or financing to optimize our balance sheet, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and our outstanding exchangeable notes and any future financing which may be dilutive to existing shareholders; the unavailability of ports of call; future increases in the price of, or major changes or reduction in, commercial airline services; changes involving the tax and environmental regulatory regimes in which we operate, including new regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions; the accuracy of any appraisals of our assets as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise; our success in controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures; trends in, or changes to, future bookings and our ability to take future reservations and receive deposits related thereto; adverse events impacting the security of travel, such as terrorist acts, armed conflict, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and threats thereof, acts of piracy, and other international events; adverse incidents involving cruise ships; adverse general economic and related factors, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or otherwise, such as fluctuating or increasing levels of interest rates, inflation, unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities and real estate markets, and perceptions of these conditions that decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence; breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection; changes in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use and/or other cruise operating costs; mechanical malfunctions and repairs, delays in our shipbuilding program, maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities; the risks and increased costs associated with operating internationally; our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues; our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage; pending or threatened litigation, investigations and enforcement actions; any further impairment of our trademarks, trade names or goodwill; volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets, which may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks, including those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees; our reliance on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; our expansion into new markets and investments in new markets and land-based destination projects; overcapacity in key markets or globally; and other factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently amplified by and will continue to be amplified by, or in the future may be amplified by, the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the impact of general macroeconomic conditions. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. The above examples are not exhaustive and new risks emerge from time to time. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections regarding our present and future business strategies and the environment in which we expect to operate in the future. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any

During the previous quarter, the company reported a sustained boost in booking volumes on account of changes in its health and safety protocols. This includes relaxed testing protocols (regardless of sailing length) and removed mandatory vaccination requirements. During the previous quarter, the company’s advanced ticket sales build rose more than 40% to $1.5 billion. Also, it stated that It stated that pricing for the full-year sailings remained higher than pre-pandemic levels. Given the pent-up demand coupled with an emphasis on reducing friction and travel-related hassles for its guests, the momentum is likely to have continued in the third quarter.Increased revenue generation from its onboard and passenger ticket is likely to have driven the third-quarter top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues is currently pegged at $1,133 million and $513 million compared with $86 million and $67 million, respectively, reported in the prior-year quarter.The Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced Baltic and Eastern Mediterranean itineraries is likely to have affected pricing in the third quarter. This and inflationary pressures and global supply chain constraints are likely to have dented the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Norwegian Cruise this time around.

According to a copy of the Alameda balance sheet seen by CoinDesk, Alameda holds $292 million of “unlocked SOL,” $863 million of “locked SOL” and $41 million of “SOL collateral.” One theory is that Alameda might try to dump its SOL tokens in a bid to raise fresh liquidity, wrote CoinDesk’s Jocelyn Yang.Early Monday, Bankman-Fried tried to assure FTX users, tweeting: ""A competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors.

It’s now at $86.5 billion market, according to CoinGecko.

While the exchange itself has had some positive headlines over the last week, like its plan to potentially purchase a bank to bolster its licensing regime, token holders might be concerned that its getting caught in a crossfire between its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and FTX’s Sam Bankman Fried.Over the weekend, CZ tweeted that Binance was planning to liquidate its holdings of FTT after CoinDesk revealed that the balance sheet of the FTX-affiliated fund Alameda Research contained a notable amount of FTT.On Twitter, spectators quickly highlighted pointed out that liquidation of FTT holdings by a stakeholder as large as Binance would likely cause market contagion if Alameda’s balance sheet became illiquid.Given that the industry just suffered through the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, testing the resilience of Alamada’s balance sheet is something that many in the industry would prefer not to do.

43,f49284f4-dca7-3543-beca-cf2db9e113c5,O,2022-11-08,Breaking Down Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Stock Before Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-occidental-petroleum-oxy-233611873.html,1667864171,STORY,"['OXY', 'CL=F', 'NG=F']","[Occidental Petroleum’s OXY third quarter earnings report on November 8 will be heavily covered with famed investor Warren Buffett controlling a significant stake in the company. With many notable energy and oil companies like Chevron CVX and Exxon Mobil XOM seeing their stocks rally after strong earnings reports, investors in OXY will be hoping for the same.Basics Trading near its 52-week high of $77.13 seen in August, a strong Q3 report could help the stock reach new highs. Oil prices have also remained near $90 a barrel making operating conditions favorable for the integrated oil and gas company.OXY’s Oil and Gas-Integrated-United States Industry is in the top 31%, and its strong business and growth have catapulted the stock over the last year. Occidental Petroleum has significant exploration and production exposure and produces a variety of chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers, and specialty chemicals.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverview Occidental Petroleum’s diversity is attractive to many shareholders including Buffett. The company is broken down into three segments: Oil &amp; Gas, Chemical, and Midstream &amp; Marketing.The Oil and Gas segment explores, develops, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL), condensate, and natural gas with both domestic and international operations. The Chemical segment manufactures and markets polyvinyl chloride resins, chlorine, and caustic soda in the U.S., Canada, and Chile. Lastly, the Midstream and Marketing segment encompasses operations that gather, treat, process, transport, store, trade, and market crude oil, natural gas, NGL, condensates, and carbon dioxide. Wall Street will be looking for further growth among the Chemical and Midstream Segments to show the company’s ability to separate itself as an elite player among integrated oil companies. Last quarter, OXY’s chemical segment income was $620 million, up 158% from Q2 2021, for the fourth consecutive quarter of record earnings. Occidental stated the increase was due to improved demand across most product lines. The Midstream and Marketing segment was also up at $247 million compared to a loss of -$3 million the prior year, driven by higher sulfur prices and sales volume. This helped the company beat earnings expectations by 8% at $3.16 per share.Story continuesInvestors will surely hope the growth and diversification of Occidental Petroleum continues along with the company’s core Oil and Gas business which saw income up a stellar 645% to $3 billion in Q2.Q3 OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for OXY’s Q3 earnings is $2.48 per share, which would represent a 185% increase from Q3 2021. However, earnings estimates for the period are significantly down from $2.78 at the beginning of the quarter. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 37% at $9.35 billion.Year over year, OXY earnings are now expected to rise 295% to $10.07, but dip -17% in FY23 at $8.29 per share after a tough-to-compete-with year. Sales are projected to be up 43% this year but decline -8% in FY23 at $34.76 billion. Occidental’s revenue is now well above its pre-covid levels, with 2019 sales at $20.91 billion.Performance &amp; Valuation Year to date OXY is up +162% to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -22% and its peer group’s +104%, which includes notable competitors Hess Corporation HES and ConocoPhillips COP. Taking a look at the stock’s post-pandemic performance, we can see OXY is up +522% to blast the benchmark when including its dividend in its total return. This is also near its peer group’s +549%.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $75 per share, OXY has a forward P/E of 7.2X. This is nicely below the industry average of 12.2X. Even better, OXY trades at a discount to its high of 19.4X earlier in the year and near the median of 7X. Plus, despite OXY’s impressive performance this year the stock trades well below the benchmark’s 17.2X. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLike other oil and energy stocks that have already beaten Q3 expectations, a strong report could be a nice catalyst for OXY and lead to a sustained rally. OXY currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While Occidental Petroleum is expected to see continued growth, earnings estimates have gone down from the beginning of the quarter.This makes an earnings beat even more significant for the stock along with the ability to show continued growth among its business segments. OXY offers investors a 0.71% annual dividend yield at $0.52 a share and long-term investors may be rewarded with the company in a top-rated industry and still appearing to trade at a discount despite oil prices remaining high.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

52,88685a33-4ef8-3c0a-9012-8349dad4efb3,FE,2022-11-08,Can FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-corp-nyse-fe-maintain-150053040.html,1667833253,STORY,['FE'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for FirstEnergy How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for FirstEnergy is:11% = US$1.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit.Does FirstEnergy Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, FirstEnergy has a higher ROE than the average (9.0%) in the Electric Utilities industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 3 risks we have identified for FirstEnergy visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining FirstEnergy's Debt And Its 11% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by FirstEnergy, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.89. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course FirstEnergy may not be the best stock to buy.

53,83ac72bd-82c8-3918-89ff-b4e3337ee0ff,FE,2022-11-08,The Illuminating Company Completes Grid Enhancement Projects in Lake County,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/illuminating-company-completes-grid-enhancement-133400042.html,1667828040,STORY,['FE'],"[Plan filed to build on project through second phase of smart grid technology investmentsMENTOR, Ohio, Nov. 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Illuminating Company, a FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) subsidiary, is wrapping up smart grid upgrades across Lake County, Ohio, to help prevent or minimize the length of service disruptions, particularly during severe weather. The work includes installation of new, automated equipment and technology in substations and along power lines serving nearly 35,000 customers in parts of Madison, Mentor, Painesville, Perry, Willoughby and nearby areas. Upgrades began in 2020 under the company's initial three-year portfolio of grid modernization work and are on track to be completed this fall.The Illuminating Company Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""As a result of system enhancements over the past three years, nearly 835,000 customer minutes of interruption have been saved in Lake County alone through our smart grid technology,"" said Pat Mullin, acting president of FirstEnergy's Ohio operations. ""These upgrades allow us to restore service to our customers faster following severe weather as well as pave the way for a more robust power system to support different types of energy sources in the years to come.""Utility personnel have finished electrical equipment upgrades in six substations in Lake County and modernized power lines that deliver electric service to customers from those facilities. With the work complete, thousands of homes and businesses in the area will benefit from the installation of 71 new automated reclosing devices in the substations and along power lines to help limit the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions.These electrical devices work like a circuit breaker in a home that shuts off power when trouble occurs, with the added benefit of automatically reenergizing a substation or power line within seconds for certain types of outages to keep power safely flowing to customers. This technology is safer and more efficient because it often allows utility personnel to automatically restore service to customers in lieu of sending a crew to investigate.Story continuesIf the device senses a more serious issue, like a fallen tree on electrical equipment, it will isolate the outage to that area and limit the total number of affected customers. The device's smart technology will quickly pinpoint the location of the fault and help utility personnel better understand the cause of the outage to help speed restoration.Locations for these automated devices were determined based on a review of historical outage patterns across Lake County to identify the areas that could benefit most from new technology.Additional power lines that tie together existing circuits have been constructed to provide more flexibility in restoring service following outages. The new power lines will help reduce the length of outages and the overall number of customers impacted by switching them to a backup line for faster service restoration.Lastly, 72 capacitor banks were installed to regulate voltage, helping provide energy savings by reducing the amount of electricity that must be generated and evenly distributing electricity to allow all customers served by a single power line to receive the same flow of safe, reliable power.Beyond the company's investments in power lines and equipment, The Illuminating Company has installed more than 25,000 smart meters for customers in Lake County since 2020. As the latest in metering technology, smart meters enable customers to better track their energy consumption and minimize estimated readings. Smart meters also can be leveraged by customers electing to enroll in programs like time-varying rates, which can provide price incentives to reduce electricity use during high demand periods throughout the day.FirstEnergy's Ohio utilities, including The Illuminating Company, recently filed a plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) that would expand smart grid technology investments. The filing, known as Ohio Grid Mod II, proposes a four-year, $626 million investment plan that builds upon system upgrades completed since the PUCO approved the utilities' Grid Mod I plan in 2019.In addition to power infrastructure upgrades, the proposed plan also includes several pilot programs that could provide enhanced customer benefits, such as providing residential and non-residential electric vehicle managed charging incentives to help support the adoption of electric vehicles across the company's Ohio service territories. The Grid Mod II Plan is subject to PUCO approval.The Illuminating Company serves 755,000 customers across Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake and Lorain counties. Connect with The Illuminating Company at www.illuminatingcompany.com, on Twitter @IlluminatingCo and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/IlluminatingCo.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

(NYSE:CRM) is a leading customer relationship management (CRM) platform with a broad suite of products that help its customers with sales, service, marketing, and analytics. Salesforce has steadily gained market share within its addressable market, that itself is growing 13% per year. Salesforce has used both organic innovation and selective M&amp;A to expand its menu of products. This has improved penetration as customers increase the number of products, or clouds, they buy from Salesforce. As a customer moves from one Salesforce cloud to two clouds, annual recurring revenue (ARR) increases 3X on average. With 3 clouds, ARR is 9X higher vs. 1 cloud, and we believe this exponential growth dynamic will increase with each successive cloud. In addition to generating recurring revenue for Salesforce, each incremental cloud helps Salesforce increase its position within the daily operations of its customers, making its products stickier. Long term, we believe these secular trends will continue, and that Salesforce will continue to gain market share, expand margins, and innovate to address the needs of its customers.""Story continuesCopyright: drserg / 123RF Stock PhotoSalesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.30bUS$7.59bUS$9.30bUS$11.7bUS$13.6bUS$15.1bUS$16.2bUS$17.2bUS$18.0bUS$18.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x27Analyst x27Analyst x14Analyst x7Analyst x5Est @ 10.29%Est @ 7.8%Est @ 6.05%Est @ 4.83%Est @ 3.97% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$5.9kUS$6.6kUS$7.5kUS$8.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.9kUS$9.9kUS$9.8kUS$9.6kUS$9.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$87bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$359bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$359b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$178bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$264b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$140, the company appears quite good value at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.037. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Salesforce, we've put together three fundamental elements you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(CRM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-salesforce-inc-140002256.html,1667829602,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 7.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.1%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.56 indicates a change of +17.7% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.93 billion and $35.35 billion estimates indicate +16.8% and +14.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.8%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.34%. The EPS surprise was +16.67%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

60,20dbd160-dd6d-35ed-bb48-e44bab7f8ccf,RL,2022-11-08,Should Investors Buy Ralph Lauren (RL) Stock Before Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-buy-ralph-lauren-rl-005412678.html,1667868852,STORY,"['RL', 'HBI']","[Investors will get a glimpse into consumer spending when Ralph Lauren RL reports its fiscal Q2 earnings on Thursday, November 10. Trading 30% from its highs, retailer or consumer discretionary earnings like Ralph Lauren will give a preview and alternative perspective on the effects a slowing economy is having on consumers with big retailers like Walmart WMT and Target TGT reporting next week.OverviewRalph Lauren’s earnings will show consumer demand and economic strength or weakness on an international level with the company being a major designer, marketer, and distributor of premium lifestyle products in North America, Europe, and Asia.RL has seen a large decline over the last year despite its diversified offerings in apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and other licensed product categories. We can see from the nearby chart that a large leg of RL’s plummet came earlier in the year as inflation concerns began to cripple the broader market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor Ralph Lauren, a strong earnings report with better than expected guidance will be crucial for its stock going forward. Last quarter RL beat earnings expectations by 9% at $1.88 per share, with a short-lived rally afterward. The company’s outlook is most crucial at this juncture with an economic downturn still expected by most amid challenging operating environments.OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RL’s fiscal Q2 earnings is $2.07 per share, which would be a decline of -21%. Earnings estimates for the period have gone down from $2.46 at the beginning of the quarter. Sales are expected to be up 3% at $1.56 billion. This is an indication that operation costs are still weighing on Ralph Lauren’s bottom line.Year over year, RL earnings are now expected to decline -6% but rise 14% in FY24 at $8.91 per share. Top line growth is expected, with sales projected to be up 2% in fiscal 2023 and rise another 5% in FY24 to $6.66 billion.Story continuesPerformance &amp; Valuation Year to date RL is down -20%, near the S&amp;P 500’s -22%. This has outperformed its peer group’s -52% decline that includes notable competitors Lululemon LULU and Hanesbrands HBI. Even better, over the last 20 years, RL is up an impressive +298% to outperform the benchmark and its peer group’s -49% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLonger-term investors are hoping Ralph Lauren can get back to its stellar past performance with the stock appearing to trade at a discount. Trading around $94 per share, RL has a forward P/E of 12.1. This is near the industry average of 10.6X. Even better, this is well below RL’s own decade-high of 242X and the median of 17.7X.Bottom LineJust as important as earnings will be Ralph Lauren’s guidance with inflation and a slowing economy still a concern. Wall Street will want to see if the company is able to give further insight and outlook for FY23 and start to reaffirm what is expected to be a return to growth in fiscal 2024. This will be critical for RL’s stock as increasing competition from Lululemon and younger digital native upstarts in premium apparel may also be a challenge along with a tougher operating environment.With that being said, Ralph Lauren should continue to be one of the leaders in its industry. RL currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and the stock appears to be trading at a discount relative to its past. Patient investors may be rewarded for holding the stock. RL also offers investors a solid 3.16% annual dividend yield at $3 per share and The Average Zacks Price Target suggests 17% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

61,d4bd4cd6-c65d-3852-8306-3dbaade25696,RL,2022-11-08,Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-corporation-nyse-rl-171819847.html,1667841499,STORY,['RL'],"[Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) has had a rough three months with its share price down 6.0%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Ralph Lauren's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ralph Lauren is:24% = US$559m ÷ US$2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.24 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Ralph Lauren's Earnings Growth And 24% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Ralph Lauren has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Ralph Lauren over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Ralph Lauren's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 11% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is RL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether RL is currently mispriced by the market.Is Ralph Lauren Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Ralph Lauren has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Moreover, Ralph Lauren is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 35%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Ralph Lauren's future ROE will be 28% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Ralph Lauren's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.56 billion, which indicates growth of 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.07 per share, which suggests a decline of 21% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has moved down 1.4% in the past 60 days.The apparel and lifestyle products company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3% in the last reported quarter. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.9%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRalph Lauren Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteRalph Lauren has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand, and expansion across all channels and regions. The company’s strategy of product elevation, acquisition of full-priced consumers, favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to have supported AUR growth in the quarter under review.The company’s focus on expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities via investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment bode well. Strength across owned and wholesale digital channels globally is likely to have been a key growth driver. Some other notable efforts on the online front are virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store”, endless aisle product availability, the introduction of additional digital sites in key markets, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition.These factors, along with the company’s first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app, are likely to have aided the top line in the quarter under review. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected year-over-year revenue growth of 11% at cc for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.However, Ralph Lauren has been reeling under the negative impacts of higher freight and marketing expenses, which are anticipated to have dented margins in the fiscal second quarter. Management, in its last reported quarter’s earnings report, predicted the gross margin to contract 40-80 bps year over year at cc in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Also, unfavorable currency fluctuations are likely to have been concerning. The company earlier expected the unfavorable currency to negatively impact revenues by 750 bps, the gross margin by 190 bps and the operating margin by 240 bps in the to-be-reported quarter. These are likely to have impacted the bottom-line performance in the said quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ralph Lauren this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ralph Lauren has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:BJ's Wholesale BJ has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Another wave of gusty winds is expected along with moderate rain and heavy snow Tuesday morning, followed by the potential for thunderstorms in the afternoon.Safety Crews and EquipmentIn anticipation of widespread winter storm conditions, PG&amp;E activated its Emergency Operations Center on Sunday, Nov. 6 and has positioned personnel and equipment to safely and quickly respond to potential weather-related outages.In advance of the storm, PG&amp;E’s vegetation management crews will be working to keep trees away from powerlines during the forecasted wet and windy weather to reduce the risk of outages caused by downed trees and other vegetation.Adverse weather conditions are expected to peak on Tuesday as unstable air and moisture remain throughout Northern California causing widespread showers at lower elevations and snow in colder, higher elevation locations.Wet and hazardous weather could linger into Wednesday in some locations ahead of mostly fair and dry conditions on Thursday. Although another, weaker system could bring more wet weather on the weekend.PG&amp;E’s meteorology team has developed a Storm Outage Prediction Model that incorporates real-time weather forecasts, historical data and system knowledge to predict where and when storm impacts will be most severe. This model enables the company to pre-stage crews and equipment as storms approach to enable rapid response to outages.PG&amp;E is urging its customers to take the necessary steps to be prepared and stay safe throughout the winter.Story continuesSafety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 911 and by calling PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights, and not candles, due to the risk of fire. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup.Have fresh drinking water, ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer during an outage to prevent foods from spoiling. Blue Ice from your picnic cooler also works well in the freezer.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should make sure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on power lines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns. Turn your appliances back on one at a time when conditions return to normal.Safely clean up: After the inclement weather has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 811 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at pge.com/bepreparedAbout PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

64,ab2d9548-cde0-3aef-9296-27ba9c8b0bb6,NWS,2022-11-08,Fox (FOXA) Receives Green Signal to Buy a Stake at FanDuel,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-receives-green-signal-173405935.html,1667842445.0,STORY,"['FOXA', 'VZIO', 'NWSA']","[Fox Corporation FOXA has recently received a green flag towards buying a stake in FanDuel, one of the biggest brands in U.S. online gambling.Fox had been facing a dispute with Flutter, the parent organization of FanDuel, over this deal over the past year, as the latter was demanding too high a price for an option to buy an 18.6% stake in FanDuel.However, recently, an arbitrator has ruled that Fox has the option to buy a stake in sports-betting operator FanDuel Group from parent company Flutter for about $3.7 billion.This comes as a strong tailwind for Fox as the deal would aid the performance of Fox Bet, the online sports betting brand of Fox, which has been struggling as it failed to gain traction in the U.S. betting market due to its poor reach and tech.The deal would help Fox in successfully diversifying itself into the booming wagering business which per Custom Markets Insight is expected to reach around USD 145.6 Billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12%.Fox to Bolster Growth With Other M&amp;A’s and PartnershipsFox Corp recently announced its merger with News Corporation NWSA. This merger would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets, including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox has also entered a multi-year deal with VIZIO VZIO to expand its distribution partnership. The Fox Sports app will now be available on VIZIO smart TVs along with the Fox Weather channel being added to VIZIO WatchFree+ besides existing Fox ad-supported LiveNOW and Fox Soul. VIZIO Ads will also have access to Fox’s premium inventory for audience-based opportunities with advertisers.Story continuesIn August, Fox announced the completion of a multi-year renewal of its distribution agreement with Verizon for its Fios TV platform.The agreement included the continued distribution of the entire portfolio of FOX brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Network and local FOX O&amp;O TV stations in markets including New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. FOX Weather has also been added to the Fios TV lineup and Tubi is included in both Fios TV set-top boxes, as well as on many other platforms. Threats Attached to the DealsThese mergers and acquisitions and partnerships are expected to bolster Fox’s top line, but they also bring certain headwinds for the company.The wagering business, into which Fox is expanding, is highly competitive with companies like DraftKings DKNG having already established a secure market position in the sports betting industry.DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.The merger with News Corporation also brings some risks for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.This has not boded well among the investors. The shares of Fox Corporation, which currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have declined 19.1% year to date compared to Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ALGN) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by Joseph Hogan, President of the company, who spent a stonking US$2.0m on stock at an average price of US$189. There's no denying a buy of that magnitude suggests conviction in a brighter future, although we do note that proportionally it only increased their holding by 6.0%. See our latest analysis for Align Technology Align Technology Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Director, Warren Thaler, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$703 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$181). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Warren Thaler.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 20.85k shares for US$4.7m. But insiders sold 5.00k shares worth US$3.5m. In total, Align Technology insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The average buy price was around US$228. These transactions suggest that insiders have considered the current price attractive. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

Align Technology insiders own 4.0% of the company, currently worth about US$567m based on the recent share price.

68,a12587f6-82b4-305e-84c9-9b0a7c384b2f,ALGN,2022-11-08,Lamb Weston and Align Technology have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lamb-weston-align-technology-highlighted-135001944.html,1667829001,STORY,"['LW', 'ALGN', 'DIS']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 7, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Lamb Weston LW as the Bull of the Day and Align Technology, Inc. ALGN asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Walt Disney Company DIS, BJ’s Wholesale Club BJ and Take-Two Interactive TTWO.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Few areas of the market have managed to stay above the selling in 2022 outside of the booming energy sector. Lamb Weston stock didn’t just avoid the fall, it has climbed over 30% YTD to hit new 52-week highs recently, as it thrives amid an economic downturn.A Consumer Staples CornerstoneLamb Weston is one of the largest suppliers of frozen potatoes in the world, selling a nearly endless array of potato-based offerings. LW makes everything from classic fries to sweet potato waffle fries and everything imaginable in between. The company also sells potato chips, hash browns, mashed potatoes, and beyond, alongside some frozen vegetables.Lamb Weston sells its frozen potato products to restaurants and retailers around the world. The company’s growth has been rather impressive outside of its covid-based downturn, as fries and potatoes are core parts of diets in the U.S. and beyond.Recent Growth and OutlookLamb Weston topped our Q1 FY23 (period ended on August 28) earnings estimate in early October. The firm grew its revenue by 14% YoY to $1.13 billion even though volumes declined due to “softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the U.S. as well as the timing of shipments to large chain restaurant customers.” LW was able to raise its prices nearly across the board, with its price/mix up 19%.Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings soared 317% to $0.75 per share to crush our bottom-line estimate by 44%. LW has now topped the Zacks consensus estimate by an average of 47% in the trailing four quarters. Despite large-scale macroeconomic setbacks, Lamb Weston executives said it was on track to deliver on the higher end of its fiscal 2023 financial targets.Story continuesZacks estimates call for Lamb Weston’s revenue to climb roughly 15% both this year and next to go from $4.10 billion in FY22 to $5.39 billion in FY24. This would follow 12% revenue growth in fiscal 2022.Lamb Weston’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar 46% this year and another 28% next year to reach $3.90 per share. Plus, its consensus EPS estimates for FY23 and FY24 have popped since its early October release to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Other FundamentalsLamb Weston stock has soared over 50% in the past 12 months vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 22% fall and its industry’s 3% climb. This run includes a nice 35% surge in 2022 that saw it break new 52-week highs on November 2.Despite the climb, LW still trades below its pre-covid peaks and its average Zacks prices target offers a 10% upside to the $85.46 a share it closed at on Friday.LW stock has climbed 185% since it was spun off from ConAgra Foods in the fall of 2016. Lamb Weston shares trade at 24.9X forward earnings, which is near its median and 22% below its highs.The stock does trade at a premium compared to its industry, but the stock has also crushed its industry since going public (185% vs. 1.5%).Lamb Weston pays a dividend that currently yields 1.2% and it repurchased $28 million of common stock last quarter. On top of that, four out of the five brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys,” alongside one “Hold.”Bottom LineLamb Weston is set to benefit from its stature as a key provider of consumer and restaurant staples amid the current bout of inflation and slowing spending.More broadly, the ongoing market and economic uncertainty favors companies with stable, boring businesses that have pricing power. Right now, it appears that investing in one half of the meat and potatoes combo could pay off for investors.Bear of the Day:Align Technology, Inc. is the company behind Invisalign. Align grew its revenue at an impressive rate over the last 10-plus years, and the firm's clear aligners have permanently reshaped the orthodontics industry.Align now faces tough-to-compete against periods and a rapid slowdown in consumer spending. The company fell short of Q3 estimates in late October and its earnings outlook is fading alongside its stock price.Align BasicsAlign’s advanced clear aligner system has shaken up the orthodontics space over the last 20-plus years, as people look for viable alternatives to traditional metal braces. Align works hand-in-hand with dentists and orthodontists who help customers through the entire process from start to finish. ALGN’s success has inspired competitors to enter the market, including SmileDirectClub.Align has helped doctors treat roughly 14 million patients with its Invisalign system, and it has expanded its reach to include wider digital services. On top of that, ALGN has slowly found success with younger customers who might have otherwise used traditional metal braces.Tougher Conditions AheadALGN posted 60% revenue growth in 2021 and it averaged 25% sales growth during the five-year stretch between FY16 and FY20. Align now faces very difficult to compete against periods of growth, including the covid rebound surge that saw customers spend big on everything from homes to straightening their teeth.Align missed our Zacks EPS estimates by 38% on October 26, as its revenue fell 12% YoY. Inflation, rising interest rates, currency headwinds, and other broad-based economic factors are tugging at ALGN’s expansion and margins. These factors are also making consumers far less willing to shell out money to straighten their teeth during these times of economic uncertainty.Align’s FY22 revenue is projected to fall roughly 5% YoY to $3.77 billion, based on Zacks estimates. The company’s adjusted earnings are expected to tumble 35% to $7.32 per share. ALGN’s consensus earnings estimates tumbled once again following its Q3 report to help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.Bottom LineThe company’s Medical - Dental Supplies industry is in the bottom 17% of over 250 Zacks industries right now and ALGN lands an overall “D” VGM grade. Align stock, like many others, soared too high too fast during the post-lockdown surge. ALGN is now down around 75% from its 2021 peaks and closed regular trading Friday at $180.93 a share.Some investors might want to keep Align on their watchlists with it now trading at 26.2X forward earnings. This nearly matches the Medical Products space that it had previously traded at a huge premium to and comes in below its decade-long median.Still, Align shares have been prone to wild up-and-down moves even before Covid-19. Overall, investors might want to stay away from the stock for now given the ongoing economic uncertainty.Additional content:What to Expect from Disney's (DIS) Q4 EarningsThe Walt Disney Company is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 8.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved down 9.5% to 57 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating an increase of 54.1% year over year.The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $21.11 billion, suggesting growth of 13.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Notably, Disney’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed in the remaining two quarters, the average surprise being 16.12%.The Walt Disney Company price-eps-surprise | The Walt Disney Company QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDisney’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results are expected to benefit from strong Disney+ growth and revival in Parks, Experiences and Products businesses.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Parks, Experiences &amp; Consumer Products revenues is currently pegged at $7.32 billion, indicating growth of 34.3% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Disney+ has emerged as a key growth driver for Disney, primarily driven by its solid content portfolio. Expanding footprint has been a key catalyst.Disney+, as of Jul 2, 2022, had 152.1 million paid subscribers compared with 116 million as of Jul 3, 2021.The rapidly growing subscriber base has strengthened Disney’s position in the increasingly saturated streaming space currently dominated by Netflix and the growing prominence of services from Apple, Peacock, Amazon prime video and HBO Max.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the number of paid subscribers of Disney+ is currently pegged at 162 million, suggesting 37.2% growth year over year.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

The deal is subject to customary terms and conditions, including closing adjustments.Further, the deal is anticipated to be concluded by year-end 2022 and will result in MRO approximately doubling its position in South Texas' Eagle Ford shale basin.The Houston, TX-based firm expects the transaction to be immediately and significantly accretive to its key financial metrics. Moreover, it will drive 17% growth in the company’s 2023 operating cash flow and a 15% rise in its free cash flow.Marathon Oil stated that the acquisition adds 130,000 net acres adjacent to its existing Eagle Ford position, with a 97% working stake, mainly situated in the prolific condensate and wet-gas windows of the play. This allows the firm to leverage its knowledge, experience and operating strengths in the region while materially augmenting its Basin-scale to 290,000 net acres.Marathon Oil anticipates gaining 600 undrilled locations, representing an inventory life of more than 15 years. Moreover, the company stated that the acquisition comprises 700 existing wells, a majority of which were completed before 2015 with early-generation completion designs, thus offering the potential for upside redevelopment.MRO expects to fund the deal with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings on the firm's revolving credit facility and new prepayable debt.Incorporated in 2001, Marathon Oil Corporation is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the United States and Africa.As of the end of 2021, Marathon Oil had approximately 1,106 million oil-equivalent barrels in net proved reserves (52% crude oil/condensate and 68% proved developed), and 89% were located in the United States.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Microsoft's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Microsoft How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:40% = US$70b ÷ US$174b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.40 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Microsoft's Earnings Growth And 40% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Microsoft has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 27% net income growth seen by Microsoft over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Microsoft's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 25% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is MSFT worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MSFT is currently mispriced by the market.Is Microsoft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The three-year median payout ratio for Microsoft is 30%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 70%. So it seems that Microsoft is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Microsoft has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 24% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Microsoft's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

That’s the fastest title to reach that milestone in the franchise’s history, says Activision-Blizzard.To date, fans have played more than 200 million hours of the game and battled in more than 1 billion matches on consoles and PC.While hitting $1 billion in sales in that span of time is impressive, it’s not an industry record. That honor goes to Grand Theft Auto V, which topped $1 billion within three days of its 2013 release. Still, it’s a big reassurance for both Activision and Microsoft, which is hoping to acquire the publisher. It’s also the biggest opening of any form in the entertainment industry this year.Call of Duty is traditionally the industry’s best-selling game each year, but there have been quiet concerns about the franchise in recent years as sales fell short of expectations.Modern Warfare II is a sequel to 2019's reboot of Modern Warfare, featuring iconic characters and themes from the original series, but packaged into fresh stories set in today's world. The single-player campaign has received so-so reviews, but the multiplayer has been highly praised.The success of the game is certain to be noted by regulators who are deciding whether to oppose Microsoft’s $68.7 billion planned acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. The deal has been under especially close scrutiny in the U.K. as regulators there fear the merger could harm competition in the video game industry, especially if Microsoft at some point no longer publishes Call of Duty games on Sony’s PlayStation or other platforms.Xbox chief Phil Spencer has said Microsoft has no plans to take the franchise away from PlayStation.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraStory continuesElon Musk is facing trial again over his $56 billion Tesla paycheck that’s ‘the largest in human history’The winners of the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot will probably take it in cash.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Signet Jewelers'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Signet Jewelers is:23% = US$469m ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.23 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Signet Jewelers' Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Signet Jewelers has an impressive ROE. On the other hand, the industry average is quite high at 29%, which tempers our excitement. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 28% net income growth reported by Signet Jewelers over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other factors driving this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a high ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So the high ROE levels also provide some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Signet Jewelers' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 31% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is SIG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Signet Jewelers Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Signet Jewelers' ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 1.6% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (98%) of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, Signet Jewelers has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 12% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Signet Jewelers' future ROE will rise to 31% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Signet Jewelers' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company has seen significant growth in its earnings backed by a respectable ROE and a high reinvestment rate. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Barrett Business Services and Paychex are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that BBSI is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.BBSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.66, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 27.04.

You can skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and current market trends and go directly to see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back.In the third quarter of 2022, inflation pressures resulted in central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy. Nominal and real bond yields have been pushed to their highest levels in over a decade as a result, with the market being thrown into a downturn. According to a Fidelity Investments report published this year, profit growth has been decelerating while remaining positive, while expectations for earnings growth among S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at 10%.As a result of the inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, the country is thrown into a state of confusion. We aren't in a recession, yet major companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), among others, are thus seeing significant decreases in their stock prices. Many are trading at historically low levels, offering investors the opportunity to buy them while they are affordable.However, the S&amp;P 500 has begun its recovery. In October, the broader benchmark posted gains of 7.99% for the month. Technology stocks are getting hammered while energy and certain healthcare stocks are doing really well this year. Overall, the benchmark is still down 18.76% year-to-date. As a result, now is the best time to buy renowned companies at a discounted rate, to benefit from future profits.Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look BackImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMany investors believe that the stock market is efficient. We disagree. The 52-week price range for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is $108 and $346. That's an extremely wide range. Was NVDA efficiently priced when it was trading at $346? How about at $108? Did the future cash flows of NVDA go down by two thirds in a matter of 12 months? We believe the stock market gets overly pessimistic right before the market bottoms and that's usually a very good time to buy for long-term investors. Selling stocks when the earnings and the P/E multiples peak is also a good idea. We don't think we are near the bottom yet, but we are getting close. It is time to get prepared which is why we are going to take a look at the following 10 stocks that we can buy on sale and stay invested for the long-term.Story continuesOur Methodology:For our list below, we have selected stocks with significant long-term growth potential despite their share prices falling this year. We have considered current projects and operations the companies are involved in to determine whether they are truly on the path to growth in the long term. We have also looked at key fundamentals such as their revenue and free cash flow growth and guidance, alongside looking at analyst ratings and price targets. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back10. Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Share Price as of November 4: $81.93Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD) is a financial company that originates, sells, and services a variety of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products and services through its subsidiaries. The company offers first mortgage, second trust, supplemental, construction, mezzanine, preferred equity, small-balance, and bridge/interim loans. It is based in Bethesda, Maryland.The company is down 50% from its recent highs, as of November 3. The company is currently trading for less than 10x its forward earnings. Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD) is however growing into a leader in commercial real estate finance. It sees more opportunities in the market this year, and has an operating revenue of $226 million, which is 24% higher than its $184 million operating revenue in the first quarter of 2021. While there is general pessimism in the commercial real estate market, Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD) is poised to remain unfazed and grow to unprecedented highs, making now the best time to buy the stock before it gets too expensive.MD Sass was the largest stakeholder in Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD) in the second quarter, holding 327,036 shares worth $31.5 million. In total, 16 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $100.3 million.Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD), like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), is among the best stocks to buy on the dip at present.9. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Share Price as of November 4: $13.26Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is an automobile manufacturer that services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles across the globe. The company operates through its Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments, and it is based in Dearborn, Michigan. It also offers wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory.An Overweight rating was reiterated on shares of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) by Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley on October 27.Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is trading exceptionally cheap right now, but the company shows room for share price growth based on strong fundamentals. The company raised its free cash flow guidance for 2022 this October, bringing it up to $9.5 billion - $10 billion, compared to the previous figures of $5.5 billion - $6.5 billion. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also saw a 10% year-over-year increase in its revenue in the third quarter.Out of 895 hedge funds tracked in the second quarter, 46 funds were long Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), with a total stake value of $608.8 million. In comparison, 46 funds were long the stock in the previous quarter as well, with a total stake value of $1.2 billion.Leaven Partners, an investment management firm, mentioned Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Share Price as of November 4: $84.68Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a consumer discretionary company operating as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee across the glove. The company operates through its North America, International, and Channel Development segments and offers coffee and tea beverages, roasted whole beans and ground coffee, single-serve products, and ready-to-drink beverages across its stores internationally. It is based in Seattle, Washington.Joshua Long at Stephens initiated coverage of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares on September 22 with an Equal Weight rating and a $91 price target.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a blue-chip stock you can buy today at a bargain since it has historically been undervalued by 16%, yet has the ability to deliver returns of almost 150% within the next five years. The company's management is guiding for 17%-22.5% CAGR long-term returns, and analysts also think 17% is likely. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) boosted its growth outlook by 2% annually in the long-term growth plan outlined in the company's 2022 investor day held this September. The company has also guided for 10%-12% annual sales growth.Bailard Inc was the largest stakeholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the second quarter, holding 71,319 shares worth $6 million. There were 55 hedge funds long the stock in total, with a total stake value of $1.4 billion.Polen Capital, an investment management firm, mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Share Price as of November 4: $90.40NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a footwear company that designs, develops, markets, and sells men's women's, and kids' athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories across the globe. The company provides its products under the Jumpman, Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron, and Jack Purcell trademarks. It is based in Beaverton, Oregon.Raymond James' Rick Patel initiated coverage of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares on October 13 with an Outperform rating and a $99 price target.While current market headwinds make most investors wary of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), the company's strong fundamentals cannot go ignored. It has managed to beat earnings estimates for the past four quarters consistently. In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, the company's EPS was $0.93, beating estimates by $0.01. Its revenue was $12.69 billion, up 3.58% year-over-year, and beating estimates by $399.97 million. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was also the biggest gainer in the Dow 30 stocks at the start of October, rising 3.25% and coming up to more than 12% in partial recovery. The company's robust fundamentals and persistence in maintaining earnings records can lead to its further growth in the coming years, especially as recession fears die down.NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was found among the 13F holdings of 72 hedge funds in the second quarter, and 67 funds in the previous quarter. Their total stake values were $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.RiverPark Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Share Price as of November 4: $134.21NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an information technology company providing graphics, and compute and networking solutions in the US, Taiwan, China, and internationally. The company is a key player in the semiconductor space, and is based in Santa Clara, California. Its products are used in the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets.A Buy rating was reiterated on shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) on October 25 by analyst Rajvindra Gill at Needham. The analyst also placed a $155 price target on the stock.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has shown strong forward guidance estimates for the next five years, showing that investing in the company now will be smart seeing as it is set to keep growing in the future. This October, the company's shares were down by 56% over the past year, meaning the time is perfect to buy the stock at a bargain. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a significant upside potential of 44%-45%.Catherine Wood's ARK Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter, holding 1.4 million shares worth $167.8 million. In total, 84 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $3.3 billion.Baron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), is a growth stock forecasted to continue beating the market in the coming years. As such, it is the best stock to buy while it's still affordable. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back. Suggested articles:11 Best Future Food Stocks To Buy11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest InDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Lamb Weston LW, General Mills GIS, American Electric Power AEP and National Fuel Gas Company NFG.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Powell’s Hawkish Tone Flares Up Volatility: 5 Ultra-Safe PicksFed Chair Jerome Powell, last week, firmly indicated that interest rates would move higher than what policymakers had anticipated in September. He had emphasized that it’s “premature” to discuss pausing interest rate hikes, while policymakers collectively agreed that tightening of monetary policy may, in due course, impact economic growth.Powell intends to continue hiking interest rates as long as inflation remains elevated. He acknowledged that inflation may have softened from its fastest rise in more than 40 years, yet core inflationary pressure continues to accelerate at a painful pace. The core consumer price index, which generally excludes food and energy components, jumped 6.6% year over year in September and registered its highest 12-month climb since 1982, according to the U.S. Labor Department.The Fed, by the way, has already approved its fourth consecutive rate hike of 75 basis points on Nov 2, taking the interest rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%. The CME FedWatch Tool added that there is a 66% possibility of a half percentage point rate hike in December, taking the interest rate to between 4.25% and 4.5%. In fact, more rate hikes are looming owing to better-than-expected payroll numbers. The labor market added 261,000 jobs in October, way more than analysts’ expectations.Any increase in jobs is expected to boost consumer outlays, thereby lifting the prices of essential goods and services. On the contrary, the Fed is aiming to curb inflation, which will no doubt lead to future rate hikes. Economists are also widely expecting Fed’s terminal rate to be 5% by mid-2023, citing a MarketWatch article.Story continuesHowever, a rate hike doesn’t bode well for the stock market since it affects consumer spending habits and deters economic growth. Perhaps that’s the reason why major bourses like the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq posted weekly declines on Nov 4. But investors shouldn’t be upset. Instead, they should place their bets on risk-adjusted stocks like Archer Daniels Midland, Lamb Weston, General Mills, American Electric Power and National Fuel Gas Company.These stocks belong to the consumer staples and utility sectors making them non-cyclical in nature, or in other words their activities remain unperturbed by market gyrations.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Archer-Daniels-Midland:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$58b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 12%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.6% generated by the Food industry. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland roceIn the above chart we have measured Archer-Daniels-Midland's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Archer-Daniels-Midland.What Can We Tell From Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROCE Trend?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Archer-Daniels-Midland. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 12%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 31% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Archer-Daniels-Midland thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROCEA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Archer-Daniels-Midland has. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland  that we think you should be aware of.While Archer-Daniels-Midland isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

99,9cc5c59a-1e50-343e-8b45-f5999f18f2d0,ADM,2022-11-08,Powell's Hawkish Tone Flares Up Volatility: 5 Ultra-Safe Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powells-hawkish-tone-flares-volatility-135901113.html,1667829541,STORY,['ADM'],"[Fed Chair Jerome Powell, last week, firmly indicated that interest rates would move higher than what policymakers had anticipated in September. He had emphasized that it’s “premature” to discuss pausing interest rate hikes, while policymakers collectively agreed that tightening of monetary policy may, in due course, impact economic growth.Powell intends to continue hiking interest rates as long as inflation remains elevated. He acknowledged that inflation may have softened from its fastest rise in more than 40 years, yet core inflationary pressure continues to accelerate at a painful pace. The core consumer price index, which generally excludes food and energy components, jumped 6.6% year over year in September and registered its highest 12-month climb since 1982, according to the U.S. Labor Department.The Fed, by the way, has already approved its fourth consecutive rate hike of 75 basis points on Nov 2, taking the interest rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%. The CME FedWatch Tool added that there is a 66% possibility of a half percentage point rate hike in December, taking the interest rate to between 4.25% and 4.5%. In fact, more rate hikes are looming owing to better-than-expected payroll numbers. The labor market adde 261,000 jobs in October, way more than analysts’ expectations.Any increase in jobs is expected to boost consumer outlays, thereby lifting the prices of essential goods and services. On the contrary, the Fed is aiming to curb inflation, which will no doubt lead to future rate hikes. Economists are also widely expecting Fed’s terminal rate to be 5% by mid-2023, citing a MarketWatch article.However, a rate hike doesn’t bode well for the stock market since it affects consumer spending habits and deters economic growth. Perhaps that’s the reason why major bourses like the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq posted weekly declines on Nov 4. But investors shouldn’t be upset. Instead, they should place their bets on risk-adjusted stocks like Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Lamb Weston LW, General Mills GIS, American Electric Power AEP and National Fuel Gas Company NFG.Story continuesThese stocks belong to the consumer staples and utility sectors making them non-cyclical in nature, or in other words their activities remain unperturbed by market gyrations. Additionally, they are dividend payers, possessing a better-quality business, which makes them immune to market volatility.

(NYSE:PM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, for US$8.3m worth of shares, at about US$111 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$90.90). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Insiders in Philip Morris International didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Philip Morris International insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$232m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Philip Morris International Insiders?The fact that there have been no Philip Morris International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.

This compares to earnings of $0.83 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this aerospace industry supplier would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of -8.43%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Ducommun , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry, posted revenues of $186.59 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $163.23 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Ducommun shares have added about 0.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.9%.What's Next for Ducommun?While Ducommun has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ducommun: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.95 on $181.94 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.23 on $699.18 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense Equipment is currently in the bottom 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.TransDigm Group (TDG), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 10.This aircraft components maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 15.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.TransDigm Group's revenues are expected to be $1.51 billion, up 18% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$75b in market cap. One-year return to shareholders is currently 62% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Schlumberger, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Schlumberger?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Schlumberger already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Schlumberger, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Schlumberger. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 6.3% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Schlumberger Limited. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$149m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Year-to-date net sales increased 8.7%, or 14.0% excluding the impact of currency translation, versus the prior year period.                  Organic(1) net sales increased 7.7% in the third quarter and 11.4% year-to-date compared to the prior year periods.                          Third quarter reported gross margin was 33.0%. Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.5%, an increase of 210 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, or flat compared to the second quarter of 2022.           Perrigo gained market share in both business segments during the quarter versus the prior year period.           Reported operating income was $33 million in the quarter compared to $438 million in the prior year and $48 million year-to-date compared to $364 million in the prior year. The reported decrease was due primarily to $418 million related to the Omega arbitration award received in the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $133 million, an increase of 19.2%, or 32.2% excluding the impact of currency translation. Year-to-date adjusted operating income was $336 million, down 3.3%, or up 5.9% excluding the impact of currency translation.                  Third quarter reported net earnings (loss) per diluted share (""EPS"") was a loss of ($0.39), as compared to a loss of ($0.40) in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date reported EPS was a loss of ($0.88), as compared to a loss of ($1.22) in the prior year period.                  Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.56, an increase of 24.4% compared to the prior year quarter. Third quarter constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65, an increase of 44.4% compared to the prior year quarter. Year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $1.32, as compared to $1.45 in the prior year period. Year-to-date constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was $1.50.                           Company reiterates fiscal 2022 organic net sales growth range outlook of 9.0%-10.0% and fiscal 2022 total net sales growth range outlook of 8.5%-9.5% versus the prior year.                        Company updates fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS range outlook to $2.00-$2.10 from $2.25-$2.35, as lower sales volumes in CSCA and $0.10 from the worsening impact of currency translation are expected to more than offset solid year-to-date performance in the international business and accretion from the purchase of the Gateway plant in the U.S. The Company now expects to achieve a constant currency adjusted diluted EPS range outlook of $2.25-$2.35.Story continues (1)See attached Appendix for details. Organic net sales growth excludes the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency.(2)In addition to other non-GAAP adjustments as described in the attached appendix, adjusted profit measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income, exclude from Q1 and Q2 2021 certain costs, which are reported in GAAP continuing operations but were previously allocated to the RX business. On a go-forward basis, such costs are either covered by the transition services agreement or have been eliminated following closing.

Net sales, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS grew substantially compared to prior year in the face of continued macro-economic headwinds. We gained market share globally, including increases across every segment as store brands continued to gain share from national brands. Although revenue growth in the quarter was robust, it was below our estimates due to unfavorable currency translation, labor shortages effecting supply and slower category growth rates.""Kessler continued, ""Importantly, business fundamentals are strong, the labor issue has improved and we just announced the first major step in our Supply Chain Reinvention Program through the infant formula investment. These, along with other margin enhancement programs being implemented, including further strategic pricing initiatives, will enable Perrigo to deliver outsized growth in 2023."" Kessler concluded, ""Going forward, our focus is on execution. Successful integration of HRA, achievement of HRA synergies, integration of the Gateway plant, implementation of supply chain initiatives and reducing leverage as planned will position Perrigo to achieve strong top and bottom line growth for years to come.""Refer to Tables I - VI at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information. The Company's reported results are included in the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows.Third Quarter 2022 Perrigo Results from Continuing OperationsThird Quarter 2022 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net SalesNet Acquisitions &amp; Divestitures Adjustment Foreign Exchange AdjustmentOrganic Net SalesCSCA4.0 %3.3 %— %7.3 %CSCI8.4 %(20.3) %20.2 %8.3 %Total Perrigo5.5 %(4.5) %6.7 %7.7 %Reported net sales increased 5.5%, constant currency net sales increased 12.3% and organic net sales increased 7.7%. Reported net sales were driven by 1) $81 million in constant currency net sales from the acquisition of HRA, 2) $55 million in strategic pricing actions across both Consumer Self-Care segments, 3) U.S. store brand share gains versus national brands and store brand competitors, and growing share in the E.U. marketplace, and 4) an increase of $25 million in cough/cold-related product sales3 that primarily benefited the Upper Respiratory category. These drivers also benefited from e-commerce growth and new product sales. This growth was partially offset by 1) the impact of unfavorable currency translation of $70 million, 2) $31 million from the divested Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand, and 3) lower net sales in certain categories, particularly in the CSCI Healthy Lifestyles category.Third quarter reported operating income was $33 million, compared to operating income of $438 million in the prior year period. This decrease was due primarily to $418 million related to the Omega arbitration award received in the prior year. Adjusted operating income grew $21 million, or 19.2%, to $133 million. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 32.2% driven by 1) higher gross profit flow-through resulting from strategic price increases, higher sales volumes and the addition of HRA, and 2) the absence of two product recalls that occurred in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by 1) a $36 million impact from inflation, including higher freight &amp; distribution expenses, 2) higher operating expenses, driven primarily by the addition of HRA, and 3) divested businesses.Reported net loss was $52 million, or ($0.39) per diluted share, compared to reported net loss of $54 million, or ($0.40) per diluted share, in the prior year period. Excluding certain charges as outlined in Table I, third quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $76 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to $61 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the prior year. Constant currency EPS for the quarter was $0.65.(3)Cough/cold-related net sales includes the cough/cold sub-category within Upper Respiratory and the Pain and Sleep Aids category.Third Quarter 2022 Business Segment Results from Continuing OperationsConsumer Self-Care Americas SegmentThird Quarter 2022 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net SalesNet Acquisitions &amp; Divestitures Adjustment Foreign Exchange AdjustmentOrganic Net SalesCSCA4.0 %3.3 %— %7.3 %CSCA reported net sales of $722 million increased 4.0%, and organic net sales increased 7.3%. Net sales growth was driven by strategic price increases, U.S. store brand share gains versus national brands and store brand competitors, and new product launches. Primary category drivers are provided below.Upper Respiratory  Net sales of $132 million increased 8.4% due primarily to share gains from national brands and store brand competitors in cough/cold and allergy, and the new launch of Nasonex®24HR. This growth was partially offset by an unfavorable 4.8 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses.Nutrition  Net sales of $124 million increased 18.1% due primarily to store brand share gains in infant formula, due in part to a national brand recall, as well as third-party contract sales. Oral electrolytes also contributed positively to sales in the quarter.Digestive Health  Net sales of $120 million increased 8.1% due primarily to increased manufacturing capacity and demand for Polyethylene Glycol 3350, and new products, including Omeprazole Cool Mint. Growth in the category was partially offset by an unfavorable 2.2 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses.Pain &amp; Sleep-Aids  Net sales of $104 million decreased 4.1% due primarily to the unfavorable impact of 7.7 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses, partially offset by higher demand for children's analgesics products.Oral Care  Net sales of $84 million increased 9.0% due primarily to Plackers® and REACH®, in addition to growth in store brand offerings, primarily manual toothbrushes.Healthy Lifestyle  Net sales of $74 million increased 2.4% due primarily to increased distribution of store brand smoking cessation products, partially offset by the discontinuation of diabetes products.Skin Care  Net sales of $49 million increased 5.4% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including Mederma® and Compeed®, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of 3.0 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand, and discontinued products.Women's Health Net sales of $12 million increased 19.2% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including ella®. Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements (""VMS"") and Other  Net sales of $23 million decreased 44.8% due primarily to the unfavorable impact of 17.0  percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses.Reported operating income was $75 million compared to operating income of $90 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased $1 million to $104 million due primarily to 1) a $31 million impact from inflation, including higher freight &amp; distribution expenses, 2) higher operating expenses primarily related to the inclusion of HRA, 3) lower profitability of contract sales to the divested Rx business, and 4) the impact of divested businesses. These factors were offset by higher gross profit flow-through resulting from net sales growth and the addition of HRA.Consumer Self-Care International SegmentThird Quarter 2022 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net SalesNet Acquisitions &amp; Divestitures Adjustment Foreign Exchange AdjustmentOrganic Net SalesCSCI8.4 %(20.3) %20.2 %8.3 %CSCI reported net sales increased 8.4%, constant currency net sales increased 28.6% and organic net sales increased 8.3%. Organic net sales growth was driven by strategic price increases and higher sales volumes led by new product launches. Primary category drivers are provided below.Skin Care  Net sales of $132 million increased 15.9%, or 37.2% excluding the impact of currency, driven primarily by the addition of HRA brands, including Compeed®, strategically priced new products in the Sebamed and ACO skincare lines, and higher net sales of anti-parasite offerings that are outpacing strong category growth.Upper Respiratory  Net sales of $63 million increased 20.8%, or 43.8% excluding the impact of currency, led by strong demand for cough/cold products, including Bronchostop, Bronchonolo, Coldrex and U.K. store brands.VMS  Net sales of $46 million decreased 15.9%, or 0.2% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to lower overall category consumption and lower sales of the nutraceutical products including Granufink and Zaffranax were mostly offset by the restocking of the Abtei brand in Germany following the third quarter 2021 recall of certain batches.Women's Health  Net sales of $30 million increased 123.1%, or 163.4% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including ellaOne® and NorLevo®.Pain &amp; Sleep-Aids  Net sales of $29 million decreased 13.9%, or an increase of 2.4% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to higher demand for Solpadeine, a paracetamol-based analgesics product.Healthy Lifestyle  Net sales of $25 million decreased 32.6%, or 19.9% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to lower category consumption in weight management and smoking cessation, impacting XLS Medical and NiQuitin, respectively.Digestive Health, Oral Care and Other  Net sales of $53 million increased 21.5%, or 44.2% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to the addition of the HRA Rare Diseases portfolio in the Other category.Reported operating income was $1 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income increased $17 million, or 36.5%, to $62 million. Constant currency adjusted operating income grew 66.8%, driven by 1) higher gross profit flow-through resulting from higher net sales growth and the addition of HRA, and 2) improved manufacturing productivity. This growth was partially offset by inflation and higher operating expenses, primarily driven by the inclusion of HRA.Fiscal 2022 OutlookThe Company reiterates its fiscal 2022 organic net sales growth range outlook of 9.0%-10.0% versus the prior year. The Company also reiterates its fiscal 2022 total net sales growth range outlook of 8.5%-9.5%, as expected accretion from the Gateway plant, along with the U.S. and Canadian rights to the Good Start® infant formula brand, are expected to offset the worsening impact of currency translation. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we now expect net sales in the full year to be unfavorably impacted by 5%-6%.The Company is updating its fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS range outlook to $2.00-$2.10 from $2.25-$2.35, as solid year-to-date performance in CSCI and accretion from the purchase of the Gateway plant, along with the U.S. and Canadian rights to the Good Start® infant formula brand, are expected to be more than offset by lower sales volumes in CSCA, and $0.10 from the worsening impact of currency translation. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS in the full year to be unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.25. The Company now expects to achieve a constant currency adjusted diluted EPS range outlook of $2.25-$2.35.The Company cannot reconcile its organic net sales growth to reported net sales or its expected adjusted diluted EPS or constant currency adjusted EPS to diluted EPS under ""Fiscal 2022 Outlook"" without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. These items include taxes, interest costs that would occur if the Company issued debt, and costs to acquire and or sell a business if the Company executed such transactions, which could significantly affect our financial results. These items depend on highly variable factors and any such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.About PerrigoPerrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO) is a leading provider of Consumer Self-Care Products and over-the-counter (OTC) health and wellness solutions that enhance individual well-being by empowering consumers to proactively prevent or treat conditions that can be self-managed.

These statements relate to future events or the Company's future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements of the Company or its industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""expect,"" ""forecast,"" ""plan,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""predict,"" ""potential"" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its variants; supply chain impacts on the Company's business; general economic, credit, and market conditions; the impact of the war in Ukraine and any escalation thereof, including the effects of economic and political sanctions imposed by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries related thereto; the outbreak or escalation of conflict in other regions where we do business; future impairment charges; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; resolution of uncertain tax positions, including the Company's appeal of the draft and final Notices of Proposed Assessment (""NOPAs"") issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the impact that an adverse result in any such proceedings would have on operating results, cash flows, and liquidity; pending and potential third-party claims and litigation, including litigation relating to the Company's restatement of previously-filed financial information and litigation relating to uncertain tax positions, including the NOPAs; potential impacts of ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; uncertainty regarding the timing of, and the Company's ability to obtain and maintain, certain regulatory approvals, including the sale of daily over-the-counter oral contraceptives; potential costs and reputational impact of product recalls or sales halts; the impact of tax reform legislation and/or changes in healthcare policy; the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the sale of its Rx business and the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with the transaction may exceed the Company's estimates or adversely affect the Company's business or operations; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the acquisition of HRA Pharma and the risks that the Company's synergy estimates are inaccurate or that the Company faces higher than anticipated integration or other costs in connection with the acquisition; risks associated with the integration of HRA Pharma, including the risk that growth rates are adversely affected by any delay in the integration of sales and distribution networks; the consummation and success of other announced and unannounced acquisitions or dispositions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other strategic initiatives and investments, including the Company's ability to achieve the expected benefits from its supply chain reinvention program. An adverse result with respect to the Company's appeal of any material outstanding tax assessments or pending litigation, including securities or drug pricing matters, could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay such assessments, damages from third-party claims, and related interest and/or penalties, and any such use of corporate assets would limit the assets available for other corporate purposes. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the sale of daily oral contraceptives without a prescription in the United States. These and other important factors, including those discussed under ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Non-GAAP MeasuresThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A ""non-GAAP financial measure"" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divested businesses, and the impact of currency,adjusted gross profit,adjusted net income,adjusted diluted earnings per share,constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share,adjusted gross margin, andadjusted operating margin.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. As noted, for the first quarter of 2021, these adjusted profit measures exclude certain stranded costs, such as those related to corporate and shared service functions related to the RX business. Under GAAP, these stranded costs are reported within continuing operations, but were previously allocated to the RX business. We exclude these costs from all adjusted profit measures, as we do not believe they are representative of the future run-rate of expenses of our continuing operations. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends.A copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on the Company's website at www.perrigo.com. PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months EndedNine Months EndedOctober 1,2022October 2,2021October 1,2022October 2,2021Net sales$             1,100.2$             1,042.7$             3,296.3$             3,033.8Cost of sales737.3706.32,223.51,980.0Gross profit362.9336.41,072.81,053.8Operating expensesDistribution30.623.384.569.0Research and development29.827.690.591.7Selling144.5129.7431.0405.0Administration105.9130.6386.0368.1Impairment charges—3.5—162.1Restructuring19.11.032.211.8Other operating expense (income), net(0.1)(417.6)0.7(417.6)Total operating expenses329.8(101.9)1,024.9690.1Operating income (loss)33.1438.347.9363.7Interest expense, net41.030.9115.194.5Other (income) expense, net(4.0)18.548.720.4Loss on extinguishment of debt(0.4)—8.9—Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes(3.5)388.9(124.8)248.8Income tax expense (benefit)48.6442.8(6.6)411.8Income (loss) from continuing operations(52.1)(53.9)(118.2)(163.0)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax2.7(5.0)1.384.5Net income (loss)$                 (49.4)$                (58.9)$               (116.9)$                 (78.5)Earnings (loss) per shareBasicContinuing operations$                 (0.39)$                 (0.40)$                 (0.88)$                 (1.22)Discontinued operations0.02(0.04)0.010.63Basic earnings (loss) per share$                 (0.37)$                (0.44)$                 (0.87)$                 (0.59)DilutedContinuing operations$                 (0.39)$                 (0.40)$                 (0.88)$                 (1.22)Discontinued operations0.02(0.04)0.010.63Diluted earnings (loss) per share$                 (0.37)$                (0.44)$                 (0.87)$                 (0.59)Weighted-average shares outstandingBasic134.6133.8134.4133.5Diluted134.6133.8134.4133.5 PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)October 1,2022December 31,2021AssetsCash and cash equivalents$               468.7$            1,864.9Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $6.9 and $7.2, respectively707.7652.9Inventories1,085.21,020.2Prepaid expenses and other current assets321.7305.8Current assets held for sale—16.1Total current assets2,583.33,859.9Property, plant and equipment, net839.9864.1Operating lease assets209.8166.9Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets3,492.43,004.7Definite-lived intangible assets, net3,002.92,146.1Deferred income taxes7.76.5Other non-current assets541.5377.5Total non-current assets8,094.26,565.8Total assets$          10,677.5$          10,425.7Liabilities and Shareholders' EquityAccounts payable$               461.4$                411.2Payroll and related taxes118.1118.5Accrued customer programs137.2125.6Other accrued liabilities242.7279.4Accrued income taxes22.116.5Current indebtedness33.5603.8Current liabilities held for sale—32.9Total current liabilities1,015.01,587.9Long-term debt, less current portion4,077.52,916.7Deferred income taxes409.1239.3Other non-current liabilities573.2530.1Total non-current liabilities5,059.83,686.1Total liabilities6,074.85,274.0Contingencies -

In the last reported quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 2.27%.Perrigo’s shares have gained 0.9% this year against the industry’s decline of 47.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerrigo’s earnings performance has been dismal over the trailing four quarters. The company’s earnings missed estimates in three of the last four quarters and beat the same once, reporting a negative earnings surprise of 11.83% on average.Perrigo Company plc Price and Consensus Perrigo Company plc Price and ConsensusPerrigo Company plc price-consensus-chart | Perrigo Company plc Quote Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the third quarter, the performance of Perrigo’s Consumer Self Care Americas (“CSCA”) and Consumer Self Care International (“CSCI”) segments is expected to have been aided byproducts added through its HRA Pharma acquisition. Significant sales growth of new products is likely to have boosted sales further during the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, currency movements are likely to have an unfavorable impact on the company’s international sales.Sales of cough/cold products have demonstrated a strong recovery in recent quarters. The momentum is expected to have continued during the third quarter, boosting the top line.Perrigo reported higher net price realization for its products during the second quarter. The improving price trend will likely be reflected in the company’s third-quarter sales, benefiting the top line. This increasing price is likely to partially offset cost headwinds (including the higher cost of goods sold), unfavorable currency movements and loss of sales in Russia and Ukraine, leading to lower operating margins.Loss of sales due to discontinued products and the exited businesses might have partially offset the gain from the new products.Investors are likely to ask questions about potential product launches next year. We also expect management to provide an update on the expected impact of currency movements and COVID-19 in 2023.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Perrigo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Here to tell us more, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. And [? Ali, ?] we talked time and time again, it was a massive hit. I haven't seen it, but I don't think a big surprise that they're going season two.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I'm not surprised. Both ""Monster"" as well as the ""Watcher"" both getting that renewal at Netflix. And ultimately, this is because the viewers wanted it. They showed up for it, had really solid reviews, really strong word of mouth. ""Monster"" consistently was on the top of the Nielsen streaming charts. And according to Netflix, it quickly became its second most popular English language TV season ever.Seasons two and seasons three have been renewed. And this is going to operate like an anthology series, which we know creator Ryan Murphy, he's all about that. So think what we've seen before from him with ""American Horror Story,"" so maybe potentially other serial killers. I'm not quite sure the direction they're going to take.Netflix said that the other seasons would focus on, quote, ""monstrous figures"" who have impacted society. So that's pretty broad. Take with it what you will.But Ryan Murphy, he's also behind the ""Watcher"". He signed a massive five-year deal with Netflix in 2018, $300 million. He's in that third year, so a little over halfway through. And finally, we're starting to see this deal pay off for the company.So we'll have to see what else Ryan Murphy can come up with. But for now, I'm certainly not surprised that these two shows were renewed. I haven't seen either one yet. The ""Watcher"" I think I will watch.- I watched.ALEXANDRA CANAL: ""Dahmer,"" I think I'm out.- I watched one episode of the ""Watcher"". It's intriguing. It wasn't enough to get me hooked.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: OK.- I heard if you give it a little bit more, give it a chance.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's loosely based on a true story in New Jersey.- It is.

From rulemaking to enforcement, the agency is pushing boundaries and expanding its reach into new and active areas of the market. Here, we provide updates on the Commission’s activity in several high-priority areas, including ESG, insider trading, ephemeral messaging, and the clawback of executive incentive-based compensation.ESG Regulation and Enforcement Using Preexisting Rules and Historical Causes of ActionSEC Chair Gary Gensler recently spoke about how various types of crypto technology, like “crypto token, stablecoin, or decentralized finance platform (DeFi) . . . are covered by [existing] securities laws.”1 Paraphrasing Aristotle, Gensler concluded, “[t]reat like cases alike.”2 Those observations mirrored earlier comments by Commissioner Hester M. Peirce on ESG regulation and enforcement:We can bring, and already have brought, greenwashing cases using existing rules, so why is additional rulemaking necessary? Should our focus instead be on identifying where there may be gaps in Commission rules and tailor[ing] any new rulemaking accordingly, rather than producing a new rule that is arguably redundant?3Such comments may reflect an institutional preference for amending preexisting rules and relying on historical causes of action rather than inventing new theories for ESG regulation and enforcement. This focus is evident in recent rulemaking, investigations, and enforcement actions — specifically, proposed amendments to the Names Rule, recent administrative proceedings against Bank of New York Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc. (“BNY Mellon”), and an ongoing investigation into Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”).Proposed Amendments to the Names RuleThe Names Rule was adopted two decades ago to protect the public from “materially deceptive and misleading [fund] name[s].”4 Among other things, it forbids names “suggesting guarantee or approval by the United States government.”5 The rule also prohibits names which suggest that a fund focuses on “certain investments or industries,” “certain countries or geographic regions,” or has “[t]ax-exempt” status, unless the fund’s name accurately reflects “at least 80%” of the value of its assets.6 This is also known as the 80% rule.Story continuesThe SEC recognizes when a fund’s name includes the term “ESG” or “similar terminology,”7 that “[i]nvestors may reasonably expect [such] funds . . . to invest in companies with policies, practices, or characteristics that are consistent with these standards.”8 The proposed amendments to the Names Rule would provide that “fund names with ESG and similar terminology . . . are subject to the rule’s 80% investment policy requirement.”9 The amendments would also “defin[e] certain uses of ESG terminology in fund names as materially deceptive and misleading.”10 The purpose of both amendments would be to stamp out “greenwashing.”11Among the proposals the SEC is considering is whether the names of “integration funds” should be categorically deemed to be “materially deceptive or misleading” if those names indicate that a fund’s “investment decisions incorporate one or more ESG factors.”12 The SEC is also mulling over whether a fund’s investment policy “must address each element in the fund name that suggests an investment focus.”13 For instance, a fund named “XYZ Environmental, Social, and Governance Fund” may be required to “adopt an 80% investment policy to address all three of those elements.”14On October 7, 2022, the SEC reopened the comment period for the proposed amendments to the Names Rule.15 So, it remains to be seen whether these amendments will emerge intact. For the time being, this serves as a useful reminder to embrace progress while keeping one foot firmly planted in the past, where much of the regulatory action still is.Settlement with Bank of New York Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc.For companies concerned with ESG, the SEC has emphasized that “all three of those elements” matter.16 However, “G,” for governance, is sometimes overlooked.17 This may be a risky assumption, as seen in a recent settled administrative action against BNY Mellon, and a private lawsuit and ongoing SEC investigation into Activision Blizzard.BNY Mellon recently found itself the subject of an administrative proceeding. At issue were alleged misstatements and omissions about how ESG principles informed the investment decisions of certain funds it advised.18 The decisional processes of two funds, the “Sustainable Funds” and the “Overlay Funds,” were scrutinized closely.19 Investment decisions for the Sustainable Funds always required adherence to a “proprietary ESG quality review.”20 To pass muster, securities had to “demonstrate attractive investment attributes and sustainable business practices,” and could not have any “material unresolvable environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.”21 By contrast, investment decisions for the Overlay Funds were “not subject to that specific investment criteria.”22But the SEC found that BNY Mellon misrepresented in board minutes and prospectuses the extent to which ESG quality reviews were part of the investment process of the Overlay Funds.23 The following statement was viewed as misleading:Integrated into the investment process [is] a well-established approach to responsible investment. This process includes identifying and considering the [ESG] risks, opportunities and issues through the research process via . . . proprietary quality reviews, in an effort to ensure that any material ESG issues are considered.24This was because “[a] reasonable investor . . . could mistakenly conclude that all portfolio holdings selected [for the Overlay Fund] were subject to an ESG quality review.”25 Also problematic was an RFP response which stated that, as part of the “due diligence process ahead of investing, each security being considered for investment . . . must have an ESG quality review conducted.”26The SEC concluded BNY Mellon had willfully violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act, and Rules 206(4)-8 and 206(4)-7 promulgated thereunder, and had also violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act, which prohibit fraud or deceit and untrue statements or omissions of material fact.27 Without admitting or denying any of the SEC’s findings, BNY Mellon agreed to an order requiring that it cease and desist from current and future violations, a censure, and a penalty payment of $1,500,000.28Investigation into Activision Blizzard, Inc.Activision Blizzard has been the subject of an investigation for different governance reasons. It started when a federal class action lawsuit claimed that Activision Blizzard had violated federal securities law by misleading investors, in significant part, through its 2020 ESG Report:Plaintiffs allege that [the ESG Report’s] provisions regarding no toleration of retaliation were materially false and misleading because during the Class Period retaliation against female employees of the Company who made sexual harassment and discrimination claims was rampant and tolerated by the Company.29While the plaintiffs’ first two complaints were dismissed, they recently filed a third amended complaint, reasserting their claims that Activision Blizzard’s public commitment to ESG materially misled investors.30 Activision Blizzard has also announced that the SEC is investigating the company on “employment matters and related issues.”31It is unclear whether any formal enforcement will materialize out of the Activision Blizzard investigation. Regardless, in light of administrative proceedings brought against BNY Mellon and other companies32 based upon their internal and external compliance efforts, this may indicate the form that future SEC enforcement may take against companies seeking to implement ESG protocols, especially in the area of governance.Insider Trading Enforcement Based on Companies’ Own Insider Trading Language and PoliciesIn another trend, the language and provisions of several companies’ own insider trading policies have played a significant role in helping the Commission expand its insider trading litigation. While the SEC has made reference to companies’ insider trading policies in prior enforcement actions, those references have generally served to establish scienter.33 And when the SEC has tried to use the provisions of a company’s own insider trading policies to expand the definition of insider trading in the past, those efforts have often failed.34 In a recent line of cases, however, the specific language and provisions of companies’ own insider trading policies have been outcome determinative.In SEC v. Jun, for example, particular provisions of Netflix’s insider trading policies were central to the SEC’s enforcement theory.35 Jun involved an insider trading ring that traded on tips about Netflix’s subscription information.36 That information was passed on at various times by three members of the circle, who were software and data engineers at Netflix.37 Of note, the SEC relied almost entirely upon Netflix’s “company policies, including its insider trading policy,” to establish that Netflix’s “periodic subscriber numbers” were material and confidential information.38Similarly, in SEC v. Panuwat, the specific language of Medivation’s insider trading policy was critical. Panuwat, an employee of Medivation, Inc., traded in short-term call options in a peer company, Incyte Corp., after learning that Pfizer was about to acquire Medivation.39 Panuwat challenged the SEC’s complaint for failing to show he had breached any duty owed to Medivation through his trading in Incyte. The SEC responded by citing to Medivation’s own insider trading policy, which broadly prohibited the use of nonpublic information to trade in “the securities of another publicly traded company.”40 In particular, the SEC seized upon the fact that Medivation’s policy used the expansive word “including” to provide a non-exclusive list of types of publicly traded companies.41Finally, in SEC v. Cavco Indus., Inc., Cavco’s investment and insider trading policies were used to support an action ancillary to a classic § 10(b) violation.42 Cavco’s corporate investment policy required it “to maintain surplus cash in a ‘low-risk, high credit quality portfolio’ such as money market accounts and Treasury bonds.”43 Before any investments could be made outside those guidelines, they needed to be approved “by both the CEO and CFO and reported to the Board of Directors.”44 The SEC sued the defendants for securities fraud in violation of § 10(b) and insufficient accounting controls in violation of § 13(b)(2)(B).45 In doing so, it relied on a step-by-step analysis of the company’s own investment and internal trading policies, describing how the trades were an improper use of “surplus cash,” and emphasizing how the trades were not disclosed to Cavco’s CEO, CFO, and board.46It is too soon to tell whether this trend is here to stay or what it forebodes. For now, market participants would be advised to work with inside and outside counsel to scrutinize their insider trading and investment policies to ensure they are not creating unintended liability and that their internal procedures around insider trading police the full scope of liability created by their policies.Ephemeral MessagingEphemeral messaging refers to the use of applications like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram to send “‘self-destructing’ messages that are deleted automatically after they are viewed or some set amount of time after they are sent.”47On October 13, 2021, the Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, opined on the need for a shift in SEC priorities, because “trust in our institutions is faltering.”48 Among other enforcement priorities, he advocated for the “robust enforcement of laws and rules concerning . . . violation[s] of record-keeping obligations.”49 Grewal specifically criticized the deliberate use of “ephemeral technology that allows messages to disappear.”50Less than a year later, the Commission responded to Grewal’s call.51 On September 27, 2022, the SEC announced sanctions against several firms for violating record-keeping rules. Those firms included Barclays, Citigroup, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and several others.52 In addition to being ordered to establish comprehensive compliance regimes within the year, each firm was required to pay civil penalties between $10 million and $125 million. All told, the eleven firms paid fines totaling $1.16 billion.53The infringing conduct constituted using personal text messaging services and other “off-channel” communication platforms like WhatsApp for communications “related to the business of the broker dealer,” and failing to “maintain or preserve” those communications.54 The Commission relied principally on Rules 17a-4 and 17a-4(b)(4) under the Exchange Act. Both rules were promulgated pursuant to the power granted under Section 17(a)(1) to issue record-keeping rules governing broker-dealers.55The SEC noted violations not just by junior employees, but managing directors and senior supervisors as well.56The SEC explained further that “recordkeeping requirements are an integral part of the investor protection function of the Commission and other securities regulators, in that the preserved records are the primary means of monitoring compliance with applicable securities laws, including antifraud provisions and financial responsibility standards.”57 And so, it expressed concern that during the relevant time periods that the firms were using ephemeral messaging technology, they were also receiving and responding to subpoenas in other unrelated investigations. The SEC emphasized that the firms’ failure to maintain or preserve records “likely impacted the Commission’s ability to carry out its regulatory functions and investigate violations of the federal securities laws across [those other] investigations.”58It is uncertain whether the SEC has reserved the right to bring further enforcement based upon the impact of the firms’ record-keeping failures on other unrelated investigations. For now, this is a space to watch closely. Furthermore, as accounting practices, corporate transparency, and record-keeping generally fall under the umbrella of governance within an ESG framework, this further underscores the importance of paying attention to “all three of those elements.”59Clawback Rules for Executive Incentive-Based CompensationOn October 26, 2022, the SEC announced that it had adopted a final rule requiring exchanges and issuers to develop and implement policies pertaining to the mandatory recovery of executive incentive-based compensation (“EIBC”) overpaid due to an issuer’s noncompliance with financial reporting requirements, as well as disclosure policies regarding the same — the so-called Clawback Rule. The Rule was proposed in 2015 to implement, for the first time, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act, an amendment added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.60 The proposal went dormant under Chairman Clayton, appointed under the Trump administration, until the comment period was reopened in October 2021. Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw described the Rule as being rooted in equitable concerns: “it is unfair to shareholders for corporations to allow executives to retain compensation that they were awarded erroneously.”61Section 10D(b) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission: (1) to make rules requiring companies to develop and implement mandatory recovery policies for clawing back excessive EIBC overpaid due to an issuer’s “material noncompliance” with “any financial reporting requirement” during the “3-year period” preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare an “accounting restatement”; and (2) to make rules requiring companies to develop and implement disclosure policiespertaining to the same.62Disclosure Policies. The Commission’s new disclosure rules require companies, among other things, to: (i) indicate on the cover of Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F if an accounting restatement is published during the relevant reporting period;63 (ii) file their internal mandatory recovery policies as exhibits to annual reports on Forms 10-K, 20-F or 40-F, or for registered management investment companies, on Form N-CSR;64 (iii) disclose how recovery policies have been applied by a company during a given reporting period under Item 402;65 and (iv) disclose various additional information in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”), “a structured (i.e. machine-readable) data language.”66Mandatory Recovery Policies. In Section 10D(b), Congress provided that the mandatory duty to recover erroneously awarded EIBC should be triggered only when an erroneous award is the result of a company’s “material noncompliance” with financial reporting rules. Although the Rule incorporates a materiality standard,67 Commissioners Peirce and Mark. T. Uyeda have criticized the Commission for defining the term “material” to include both “Big R” and “little r” accounting restatements, which may “require [the] clawback of de minimis amounts.”68 While the Commission has certainly shown an increasing preference for a broad treatment of “materiality” in different settings, it has generally assured market participants that the term will be construed in a manner “consistent with applicable case law.”69 Critics contend, however, that the Clawback Rule strains the meaning of materiality to its limits, in “conflict with the statutory directive.”70This seems to be by design, as the Commission aims to capture any and all erroneously awarded EIBC. In the Commission’s view, the Rule requires the recovery of “any incentive-based compensation that may be impacted by financial reporting.”71 The Rule was thus drafted “with the view that discretion to implement and execute [clawback] policies . . . should be limited.”72 At the same time, it was drafted with an understanding that these “policies were intended to apply broadly.”73 This dual heuristic has had two consequences.First, the Commission has stripped boards of directors of the discretion to determine whether an error is “material” — that is to say, whether it requires “Big R” or “little r” accounting restatements.74 “Big R” restatements involve corrections to “historical financial statements” of “errors that were material to those previously issued financial statements.”75 By contrast, “little r” restatements typically “deal with immaterial misstatements, or adjustments made in the normal course of business” and are “not generally viewed as a sign of poor reporting.”76 But, as mentioned previously, the Clawback Rule’s definition of “material error[] . . . include[s] both.”77 The Commission has also explained that “[w]hile an initial error amount may not have been material to previously issued financial statements, it may become material due to its cumulative effect over multiple reporting periods.”78Second, the Commission has adopted an “intentionally broad definition of executive officer.”79 The Senate Banking Committee understood Section 10D(b) to authorize rulemaking requiring mandatory recovery from only “a very limited number of employees.”80 But the Clawback Rule defines “executive officer” to include, among others, “any other officer who performs a policy-making function.”81 The scope of mandatory recovery is also not limited to just “those officers who may be ‘at fault’ for accounting errors . . . nor to those who are directly responsible for the preparation of the financial statements.”82The Rule thus requires the implementation of clawback and disclosure policies pertaining to the incentive-based compensation awarded to any officer who performs a policy-making function. Furthermore, it triggers the duty of mandatory recovery when an erroneous award is the result of a company’s noncompliance with any financial rule, as defined by an exceedingly broad (and potentially illusory) standard of materiality.The “Impracticability” Exception. The Rule contains at least one safeguard for companies — referred to as the “impracticability” exception — wherein recovery may not be required if: (i) “[t]he direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the policy would exceed the amount recovered”; (ii) “[r]ecovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to [the Rule’s publication in the Federal Register]”; or (iii) “[r]ecovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan . . . to fail to meet the requirements of [26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(13) or 411(a)] and any regulations thereunder.”83 Even so, Commissioner Peirce, dissenting from the rule, described the exception “itself [as] impracticable,” since it imposes significant costs on any company seeking to take advantage of it.84 This is because, before the exception applies, a company must first make “a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation” and document and report the same, or first “obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the applicable national securities exchange or association.”85The time for compliance is short. Each exchange is required to file “proposed listing standards” no later than 90 days following the Rule’s publication in the Federal Register.86 Those standards must be effective within “one year” after the Rule’s publication.87 Once that occurs, issuers will have only 60 days to adopt and implement their own mandatory recovery policies.88 In these circumstances, market participants are advised to begin working with counsel immediately to discuss the drafting and implementation of mandatory recovery and disclosure policies, and to seek advice on structuring executive compensation and benefits — and insider trading policies, internal controls around ESG disclosures, and more — to reflect this new landscape of risk.1 Statement, Gary Gensler, Chair, U.S. Sec. &amp; Exch.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF, Japan Tobacco Inc. JAPAY, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. MMP, HSBC Holdings plc HSBC and Phillips 66 PSX.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Is It Time to Dive Back into Stocks?The net effect of what we learnt from the Fed last week was that interest rates would continue to be taken up, but it could be at smaller increments and it could be that the cumulative increase would be larger than what we had anticipated earlier. Clearly, the Fed wants to feel its way just as we do, because there really isn’t a crystal ball that can tell us the exact effect on inflation.Historically, the Fed has always overdone it, so there’s no reason to think that this will be different. Which means that we could be headed into a recession sometime in the middle of 2023.Additionally, the jobs data from last week, which would be kind of good in normal times, is kind of not-so-good now because it can only encourage the Fed to continue doing what it has been doing:Total additions were a good bit stronger than expected, although hourly earnings (up 4.7% from last year, up 0.4% from the previous month) were about as expected (Bloomberg estimates, quoted by Yahoo Finance).Therefore, despite all the doom and gloom in the forecast, companies still don’t want to let their employees go. Not only that, they’re building their forces. All except the tech companies that is, because that group has built itself an army that was great during the pandemic but expensive to feed as we move down.What this means is that we still have a resilient consumer, i.e. people are still buying, which means that companies are still producing, which means earnings are still not as bad as they’re required to be (for the Fed). Which means that the rate hike saga is set to continue.Story continuesBut there are “encouraging” signs as well.The manufacturing PMI for October, although still above 1, registered its slowest growth this year, dropping to the levels seen in Jul 2020. Moreover, new orders suffered a big blow as rising inflation continued to increase uncertainties.The housing market is also softening. Tied directly to interest rates, mortgage rates have jumped to 20-year highs. As a result of the hit to affordability, home prices are coming down. The Fannie Mae home price index shows a 9.0% increase in prices at 2022 year-end (it was previously at +16.0%). Home prices are expected to decline 1.5% in 2023 (previous forecast was for a 4.4% increase). Total home sales are expected to drop 18.1% from last year (previous forecast was for a 17.1% decline), driven by existing home sales.The automotive market is also entering a soft phase. With supply chain problems easing, inventories have picked up. But higher rates have pushed up borrowing cost, which is keeping customers away. Therefore, prices should start coming down about now, with a corresponding positive effect on inflation.The macro situation described above seems to indicate that further softness is in the cards. However, it’s worth noting that estimates have been coming down, with the S&amp;P 500 benchmark dropping more than 10% for 2023 on an ex-Energy basis since mid-April. There could be downside risk to the 3.5% growth in aggregate 2023 estimates for the S&amp;P 500, but as we stand today, we are only expecting a moderate recession in the back half. Therefore, there is a reasonable chance of companies reporting positive surprises next year, which would support prices. And if such an outlook seems fraught with risk, large cap stocks that have a relatively stronger outlook based on estimate revisions trends, that also pay a nice dividend could be a hedge:Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. Based in Mexico City, the company is a franchise bottler, producing, marketing, selling and distributing Coca-Cola trademark beverages through retail outlets, restaurants and bars, auditoriums, supermarkets and other locations.The Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) ranked stock pays an attractive dividend that yields 4.25%. It belongs to the Beverages - Soft drinks industry (top 34% of Zacks-ranked industries).The 2022 earnings estimate is up 11.4% in the last 30 days. The 2023 estimate is up 7.4%. Therefore, analysts are relatively optimistic about its prospects.The shares trade at 15.15X earnings, compared with the S&amp;P’s 16.62X. They are trading below their 5-year median level of 16.73X P/E.Japan Tobacco Inc.Tokyo-based Japan Tobacco manufactures and sells tobacco products, prescription drugs and processed foods in Japan and internationally.The Zacks Rank #1 stock offers a 4.13% yield. It belongs to the Tobacco industry, which is in the top 24% of Zacks-ranked industries.Its 2022 estimate is up 7.3% in the last 30 days while the 2023 estimate is up 12.2%.Japan Tobacco’s shares trade at a 10.41X multiple, which is below its median value of 11.92X P/E over the last five years. Therefore, the shares are cheap at these levels.Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. Oklahoma-based Magellan Midstream engages in the transportation, storage, and distribution of refined petroleum products and crude oil in the United States.The Zacks #2 (Buy) ranked stock’s dividend yields 8.12%. The Oil and Gas – Production Pipeline – MLB industry to which it belongs is however in the bottom 45% of Zacks-ranked industries. It is the top 50% that have historically been known to outperform the bottom 50% in the near term. But the high yield makes this stock a relatively safe play in the current environment.Magellan’s 2022 estimate is up 9.7% in the last 30 days while its 2023 estimate is up 4.9%.The shares trade at 10.35X P/E, which is cheaper than the S&amp;P 500 and also its own median level of 12.36X P/E over the past five years.HSBC Holdings plc London-based HSBC provides banking and financial services worldwide.The Zacks Rank #2 stock pays a dividend that currently yields 4.76%. It belongs to the Banks – Foreign industry (top 32%).For 2022, analyst estimates have risen 5.1%. For 2023, they’re up 1.1%.At 6.10X P/E, the shares are trading at a significant discount to their five-year median P/E of 10.77X.Phillips 66Houston-based Phillips 66 operates as an energy manufacturing and logistics company. It operates through four segments: Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties (M&amp;S).The Zacks Rank #2 stock pays a dividend yield of 3.75%.

This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 6.89% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.41% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from TJX as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 16, 2022. In that report, analysts expect TJX to post earnings of $0.80 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 4.76%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.27 billion, down 2.13% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.11 per share and revenue of $49.78 billion, which would represent changes of +9.12% and +2.54%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for TJX. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

(NYSE:TJX) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.31bUS$3.16bUS$4.12bUS$3.87bUS$5.34bUS$5.95bUS$6.45bUS$6.87bUS$7.23bUS$7.53bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 11.27%Est @ 8.48%Est @ 6.53%Est @ 5.17%Est @ 4.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$2.2kUS$2.7kUS$3.3kUS$2.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$34bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$145bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$145b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$72bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$106b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$71.2, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.029. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Repatha continues to be at the forefront of PCSK9i research, with the longest safety and efficacy trial data among PCSK9i treatments for cardiovascular disease, providing crucial information for patients and doctors managing this disease.""This pre-specified exploratory analysis examined the association between achievement of different LDL-C levels with the incidence of cardiovascular and safety outcomes for up to 8.6 years of follow up.1 Between the parent FOURIER and FOURIER-OLE studies, over 3,500 patients (13%) achieved LDL-C levels of &lt;20 mg/dL and over 10,000 (39%) achieved LDL-C levels of &lt;40 mg/dL.1 This analysis found that over the course of 77,470 patient-years of follow-up there was a monotonic relationship between lower LDL-C levels – down to very low LDL-C levels &lt;20 mg/dL – and a lower risk of the efficacy endpoint from FOURIER of CV death, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization or hospital admission for unstable angina (see Figure 1).1Story continuesFigure 1: Primary Endpoint CV death, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization or hospitalization for unstable anginaA similar relationship was observed between achieved LDL-C levels and the risk of the key secondary efficacy endpoint from FOURIER of CV death, MI or stroke (P for trend&lt;0.0001) (see Figure 2).1 There were no significant associations between lower achieved LDL-C and the risk of serious adverse events, neurocognitive events, the development of new onset diabetes, cataract-related adverse events, new or progressive malignancy, the occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke, muscle-related events or non-cardiovascular death.1Figure 2: Secondary Endpoint CV death, MI or stroke""Until now, there was a gap in the medical knowledge of the long-term efficacy and safety implications of a very low LDL-C level &lt;20 mg/dL,"" said Marc S. Sabatine, MD, Chair of the TIMI Study Group at Brigham and Women's Hospital and senior investigator for this study. ""These data fill that gap by demonstrating that a lower LDL-C level was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes with a similar safety profile, down to very low LDL-C levels. Furthermore, these data substantiate the use of a PCSK9 inhibitor to reduce LDL-C below the threshold of 55 mg/dL for very high-risk ASCVD patients, as recommended in the recently published ACC 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Nonstatin Therapies for LDL-C Lowering in the Management of ASCVD Risk.""Prolonged LDL-C reduction with Repatha is also being studied in 12,301 patients without a prior heart attack or stroke in the ongoing VESALIUS-CV (NCT03872401) outcomes trial.About Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)CVD remains the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability and rising healthcare costs.2,3 LDL-C is a key modifiable risk factor for the development of CVD, yet nearly half of post-MI patients fail to achieve guideline recommended LDL-C goals, including those taking high-intensity statins, leaving many patients at risk for another cardiovascular event.4,5 Nearly one in five patients who have had a heart attack will have another cardiovascular event within one year, so it's important that patients get their LDL-C to guideline recommended levels.6 The American College of Cardiology's recent Expert Consensus Decision Pathway reinforces the criticality of lowering LDL-C in an update to the previous guidelines, including a lower threshold of 55 mg/dL for very high-risk ASCVD patients, and underscores the important role that PCSK9 inhibitor mAbs, like Repatha, play in helping to prevent cardiovascular events, like heart attack and stroke.7Repatha® FOURIER and FOURIER-OLE Study DesignFOURIER (20110118) was a multinational Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, designed to evaluate whether treatment with Repatha in combination with statin therapy compared to placebo plus statin therapy reduced cardiovascular events. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke.Eligible patients with high cholesterol (LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] ≥100 mg/dL) and clinically evident ASCVD at more than 1,300 study locations around the world were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly plus effective statin dose; or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly plus effective statin dose. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. The study was event driven and continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary endpoint.FOURIER-OLE were multicenter, open-label extension studies designed to assess the extended long-term safety of evolocumab in subjects who completed the FOURIER study. The FOURIER-OLE was composed of studies 20130295 and 20160250, which enrolled 5,035 and 1,600 subjects who completed the FOURIER study to receive open-label evolocumab and were followed up for a median of 5 and 4.6 years, respectively. All patients in the extension program were treated with open label evolocumab resulting in no concurrent placebo arm during this period. Although not all patients participated in FOURIER-OLE, baseline characteristics were broadly comparable between the originally randomized treatment arms, thereby allowing for reasonably unconfounded exploratory comparisons between groups.Total of 26,389 patients had an early achieved LDL-C available, 19,960 of whom were in FOURIER alone with a median follow-up of 2.0 years and 6,429 of whom also participated in FOURIER-OLE with a median follow-up of ~7 years and a maximum follow-up of 8.6 years.PROFICIO ProgramFOURIER and its extension studies are part of Amgen's PROFICIO (Program to Reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular Outcomes Following Inhibition of PCSK9 In different populations) program of clinical studies investigating the impact of Repatha® on LDL-C and CVD across multiple populations at high CV risk, including those managed by statins, statin-intolerant patients, those with genetic disorders and patients with atherosclerosis.

Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. The clinical benefits and safety of Repatha have been studied for 12 years in 50 clinical trials with over 47,000 patients. This vast body of evidence demonstrates that Repatha works rapidly.Repatha is approved in more than 75 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.Important U.S. Product Information8Repatha is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor antibody indicated:in adults with established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularizationas an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC)-lowering therapies, in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), to reduce LDL-Cas an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C-lowering therapies in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with HeFH, to reduce LDL-Cas an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), to reduce LDL-CThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha have not been established in pediatric patients with HeFH or HoFH who are younger than 10 years old or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia or HeFH.Important U.S. Safety Information8INDICATIONSRepatha® is indicated:In adults with established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularizationAs an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering therapies, in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), to reduce LDL–CAs an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C-lowering therapies in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with HeFH, to reduce LDL-CAs an adjunct to other LDL–C-lowering therapies in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), to reduce LDL–CThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with HeFH or HoFH who are younger than 10 years old or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Contraindication: Repatha® is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to evolocumab or any of the excipients in Repatha®.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, or the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, or the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative.

A jury awarded the plaintiffs $778 million in damages, which a judge later increased to $1.2 billion.But the patent-focused U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out the award last year, finding that the patent was invalid because it lacked a sufficient written description. Juno and Sloan Kettering have told the Supreme Court that the Federal Circuit's decision to invalidate the patent and other rulings against biologic patents have been ""devastating for innovation.""A Bristol Myers Squibb spokesperson said on Monday that it had sought high-court review to ""restore the proper balance to our innovation economy by reaffirming the existing patent statute, which requires only a 'written description of the invention' that is adequate to inform skilled workers how to make and use it.""""We will continue to work to correct this imbalance and the erroneous standard that has been set by the Federal Circuit,"" the spokesperson said.A Gilead spokesperson said the company was pleased with the Supreme Court's decision, which has ""effectively ended"" the dispute.Biologic drugs are made from biological cells, unlike traditional pharmaceuticals. Kite created Yescarta, which reprograms the body's immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. Worldwide sales of Yescarta reached nearly $700 million last year.Story continuesJuno told the Supreme Court in its appeal that the Federal Circuit's validity standard for patents forces biologic inventors to outline an ""essentially infinite number"" of potential variations in a patent.Pharmaceutical companies including Amgen Inc and GlaxoSmithKline and research institutions including the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital filed briefs in support of Juno.Kite said in a brief to the Supreme Court that the Federal Circuit's decision was in line with longstanding patent law and that Juno's patent had ""tried to monopolize - and block everyone else from investigating - millions of billions of possible drug candidates at the infancy of a field.""On Nov. 4, the Supreme Court took up another patent case involving biologic drugs, agreeing to hear Amgen's bid to revive patents on its cholesterol drug Repatha.

The active ingredient of AMJEVITA is an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody that has the same amino acid sequence as, and is highly similar to, adalimumab. AMJEVITA will be delivered in prefilled syringe and autoinjector presentations to support dosing in each of the approved indications.AMJEVITA is not currently available commercially.  This not an offer for sale. The following information is derived from the approved label.AMJEVITA is indicated, alone or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs, for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.AMJEVITA is indicated, alone or in combination with methotrexate, for reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 4 years of age and older.AMJEVITA is indicated, alone or in combination with non-biologic DMARDs, for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.AMJEVITA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.AMJEVITA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy, and reducing signs and symptoms and inducing clinical remission in these patients if they have also lost response to or are intolerant to infliximab.AMJEVITA is indicated for inducing and sustaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine. The effectiveness of adalimumab products has not been established in patients who have lost response to or were intolerant to TNF blockers.AMJEVITA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. AMJEVITA should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a physician.IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATIONSERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with AMJEVITA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue AMJEVITA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before AMJEVITA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to AMJEVITA use.Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with AMJEVITA prior to initiating therapy in patients: 1. with chronic or recurrent infection, 2. who have been exposed to TB, 3. with a history of opportunistic infection, 4. who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic, 5. with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with AMJEVITA, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start AMJEVITA during an active infection, including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops, monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.Drug interactions with biologic products: A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. An increased risk of serious infections has been seen with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no demonstrated added benefit in patients with RA. Concomitant administration of AMJEVITA with other biologic DMARDs (e.g., anakinra or abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based on the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF-blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants.  Consider the risks and benefits of AMJEVITA prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials of some TNF blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies were observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control patients.Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was reported during clinical trials for adalimumab-treated patients. Examine all patients, particularly those with a history of prolonged immunosuppressant or PUVA therapy, for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with AMJEVITA.In adalimumab clinical trials, there was an approximate 3-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at higher risk of lymphoma than the general population, even in the absence of TNF blockers.Postmarketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use. Approximately half of the postmarketing cases of malignancies in children, adolescents, and young adults receiving TNF blockers were lymphomas; other cases included rare malignancies associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually observed in children and adolescents.HYPERSENSITIVITYAnaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, stop AMJEVITA and institute appropriate therapy.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers, including AMJEVITA, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.  Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them during and after AMJEVITA treatment. Discontinue AMJEVITA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming AMJEVITA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers, including adalimumab products, have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Exercise caution when considering AMJEVITA for patients with these disorders; discontinuation of AMJEVITA should be considered if any of these disorders develop.HEMATOLOGICAL REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia, including aplastic anemia, have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with adalimumab products.  Consider stopping AMJEVITA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.CONGESTIVE HEART FAILUREWorsening or new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have been observed with adalimumab products; exercise caution and monitor carefully.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on AMJEVITA should not receive live vaccines. Pediatric patients, if possible, should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating AMJEVITA therapy. Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in utero exposed infant. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in adalimumab clinical trials (&gt;10%) were: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache, and rash.Please see full AMJEVITA Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.

AMJEVITA should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a physician.About Systemic Lupus Erythematosus &amp; AMG 592 (efavaleukin alfa) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can impact multiple organ systems. Efavaleukin alfa is an IL-2 mutein Fc fusion protein. It is being investigated for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including SLE.About ENBREL (etanercept)ENBREL is a soluble form of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor with a clinical efficacy and safety profile established over 20 years of collective clinical experience. ENBREL was first approved in 1998 for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. ENBREL was approved in 1999 to treat moderate-to-severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in 2002 to treat psoriatic arthritis, in 2003 for the treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, in 2004 to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults, and in 2016 the moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis indication was expanded to include patients 4 years or older. Prescription ENBREL is given by injection.ENBREL U.S. Important Safety InformationPatients treated with ENBREL are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids or were predisposed to infection because of their underlying disease. ENBREL should not be initiated in the presence of sepsis, active infections, or allergy to ENBREL or its components. ENBREL should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: 1) Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent TB before ENBREL use and periodically during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to ENBREL use, 2) Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness, and 3) Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.The risks and benefits of treatment with ENBREL should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients 1) with chronic or recurrent infection, 2) who have been exposed to TB, 3) who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic TB or endemic mycoses, or 4) with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infections such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with ENBREL, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB prior to initiating therapy.Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including ENBREL. In adult clinical trials of all TNF blockers, more cases of lymphoma were seen compared to control patients. The risk of lymphoma may be up to several-fold higher in RA patients. The role of TNF blocker therapy in the development of malignancies is unknown. Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with postmarketing TNF blocker use in RA and other indications. The risk of leukemia may be higher in patients with RA (approximately 2-fold) than the general population. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including ENBREL. Periodic skin examinations should be considered for all patients at increased risk for skin cancer. In patients who initiated therapy at ≤ 18 years of age, approximately half of the reported malignancies were lymphomas (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Other cases included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants.Treatment with TNF-blocking agents, including ENBREL, has been associated with rare (&lt; 0.1%) cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system demyelinating disorders, some presenting with mental status changes and some associated with permanent disability, and with peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders. Cases of transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndromes, other peripheral demyelinating neuropathies, and new onset or exacerbation of seizure disorders have been reported in post marketing experience with ENBREL therapy. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of ENBREL in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders.Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and, rarely, new-onset cases have been reported in patients taking ENBREL. Caution should be used when using ENBREL in patients with CHF. These patients should be carefully monitored. Rare cases of pancytopenia, including aplastic anemia, some fatal, have been reported. The causal relationship to ENBREL therapy remains unclear. Exercise caution when considering ENBREL in patients who have a previous history of significant hematologic abnormalities. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of blood dyscrasias or infection. Consider discontinuing ENBREL if significant hematologic abnormalities are confirmed. Reactivation of hepatitis B has been reported in patients who were previously infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and received concomitant TNF-blocking agents, including ENBREL. Most reports occurred in patients also taking immunosuppressive agents, which may contribute to hepatitis B reactivation. Exercise caution when considering ENBREL in these patients.Allergic reactions associated with administration of ENBREL during clinical trials have been reported in &lt; 2% of patients. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of ENBREL should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Live vaccines should not be administered to patients on ENBREL. Pediatric patients, if possible, should be brought up to date with all immunizations prior to initiating ENBREL. In patients with exposure to varicella virus, temporarily discontinue ENBREL and consider prophylactic treatment with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin. Autoantibodies may develop with ENBREL, and rarely lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis may occur. These may resolve upon withdrawal of ENBREL. Stop ENBREL if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develops. The use of ENBREL in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis receiving immunosuppressive agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide) is not recommended. Based on a study of patients treated for alcoholic hepatitis, exercise caution when using ENBREL in patients with moderate-to-severe alcoholic hepatitis.The most commonly reported adverse reactions in RA clinical trials were injection site reaction and infection. In clinical trials of all other adult indications, adverse reactions were similar to those reported in RA clinical trials. In general, the adverse reactions in pediatric patients were similar in frequency and type as those seen in adult patients. The types of infections reported in pediatric patients were generally mild and consistent with those commonly seen in the general pediatric population.The use of ENBREL in patients receiving concurrent cyclophosphamide therapy is not recommended. The risk of serious infection may increase with concomitant use of abatacept therapy. Concurrent therapy with ENBREL and anakinra is not recommended. Hypoglycemia has been reported following initiation of ENBREL therapy in patients receiving medication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients.Please see ENBREL full Prescribing Information.About EVENITY® (romosozumab-aqqg)EVENITY is a bone-building humanized monoclonal antibody. It is designed to work by inhibiting the activity of sclerostin, which simultaneously results in increased bone formation and to a lesser extent decreased bone resorption. The EVENITY development program includes 19 clinical studies that enrolled more than 14,000 patients. EVENITY has been studied for its potential to reduce the risk of fractures in an extensive global Phase 3 program that included two large fracture trials comparing EVENITY to either placebo or active comparator in nearly 12,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Amgen and UCB are co-developing EVENITY.EVENITY® U.S. Indication EVENITY® is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.The anabolic effect of EVENITY® wanes after 12 monthly doses of therapy. Therefore, the duration of EVENITY® use should be limited to 12 monthly doses. If osteoporosis therapy remains warranted, continued therapy with an antiresorptive agent should be considered.EVENITY® Important U.S. Important Safety InformationPOTENTIAL RISK OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DEATHEVENITY® may increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. EVENITY® should not be initiated in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding year. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction and stroke and instruct patients to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, EVENITY® should be discontinued.In a randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women, there was a higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, in patients treated with EVENITY® compared to those treated with alendronate.Contraindications: EVENITY® is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with EVENITY®. EVENITY® is contraindicated in patients with a history of systemic hypersensitivity to romosozumab or to any component of the product formulation. Reactions have included angioedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria.Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, dermatitis, rash, and urticaria have occurred in EVENITY®-treated patients. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of EVENITY®.Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia has occurred in patients receiving EVENITY®. Correct hypocalcemia prior to initiating EVENITY®. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia, particularly in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D while on EVENITY®.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): ONJ, which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving EVENITY®. A routine oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of EVENITY®. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ (chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, angiogenesis inhibitors, and corticosteroids) may increase the risk of developing ONJ. Other risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, and coagulopathy.For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment should guide the management plan of each patient. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of EVENITY® should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment.Atypical Femoral Fractures: Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving EVENITY®. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated.During EVENITY® treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Interruption of EVENITY® therapy should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment.Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported with EVENITY® were arthralgia and headache.EVENITY® is a humanized monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.Please see EVENITY® full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About Otezla® (apremilast)Otezla® (apremilast) is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which Otezla exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined.Since its initial FDA approval in 2014, Otezla has been prescribed to more than 700,000 patients worldwide.Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. INDICATIONSOtezla® (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease.Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONContraindicationsOtezla is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulationWarnings and PrecautionsHypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported during postmarketing surveillance. If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Otezla and institute appropriate therapyDiarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomitingDepression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occurWeight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of OtezlaDrug Interactions: Apremilast exposure was decreased when Otezla was co-administered with rifampin, a strong CYP450 enzyme inducer; loss of Otezla efficacy may occur. Concomitant use of Otezla with CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommendedAdverse ReactionsPlaque Psoriasis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache, including tension headache.  Overall, the safety profile of Otezla in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis was consistent with the safety profile previously established in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasisPsoriatic Arthritis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, and headacheBehçet's Disease: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) are diarrhea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection.Use in Specific PopulationsOtezla has not been studied in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal loss.Please see Otezla full Prescribing Information.About Prolia® (denosumab)Prolia is the first approved therapy that specifically targets RANK Ligand, an essential regulator of bone-removing cells (osteoclasts). Prolia is approved and marketed in over 80 countries worldwide.Prolia® U.S. IndicationsProlia® is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, Prolia® reduces the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures.Prolia® is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Prolia® is indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 6 months. High risk of fracture is defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Prolia® is indicated as a treatment to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. In these patients Prolia® also reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures.Prolia® is indicated as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.Prolia® U.S. Important Safety InformationContraindicationsProlia® is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia. Pre–existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating Prolia®. Prolia® is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and may cause fetal harm. In women of reproductive potential, pregnancy testing should be performed prior to initiating treatment with Prolia®. Prolia® is contraindicated in patients with a history of systemic hypersensitivity to any component of the product. Reactions have included anaphylaxis, facial swelling and urticaria.Same Active IngredientProlia® contains the same active ingredient (denosumab) found in XGEVA®. Patients receiving Prolia® should not receive XGEVA®HypersensitivityClinically significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with Prolia®. Symptoms have included hypotension, dyspnea, throat tightness, facial and upper airway edema, pruritus, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of Prolia®.HypocalcemiaHypocalcemia may worsen with the use of Prolia®, especially in patients with severe renal impairment. In patients predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism, including treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs, clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels is highly recommended within 14 days of Prolia® injection. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may worsen hypocalcemia risk and serum calcium should be closely monitored.  Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)ONJ, which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving Prolia®. An oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of Prolia®. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry is recommended prior to treatment in patients with risk factors for ONJ such as invasive dental procedures, diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders. Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with Prolia®. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to Prolia®.For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment should guide the management plan of each patient. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. Extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of Prolia® should be considered based on individual benefit-risk assessment.Atypical Femoral FracturesAtypical low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the shaft have been reported in patients receiving Prolia®. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with antiresorptive agents.During Prolia® treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Interruption of Prolia® therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Discontinuation of Prolia® TreatmentFollowing discontinuation of Prolia® treatment, fracture risk increases, including the risk of multiple vertebral fractures. New vertebral fractures occurred as early as 7 months (on average 19 months) after the last dose of Prolia®. Prior vertebral fracture was a predictor of multiple vertebral fractures after Prolia® discontinuation. Evaluate an individual's benefit/risk before initiating treatment with Prolia®. If Prolia® treatment is discontinued, patients should be transitioned to an alternative antiresorptive therapy.Serious InfectionsIn a clinical trial (N= 7808) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, serious infections leading to hospitalization were reported more frequently in the Prolia® group than in the placebo group. Serious skin infections, as well as infections of the abdomen, urinary tract and ear were more frequent in patients treated with Prolia®.Endocarditis was also reported more frequently in Prolia®-treated patients. The incidence of opportunistic infections and the overall incidence of infections were similar between the treatment groups. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of severe infection, including cellulitis.Patients on concomitant immunosuppressant agents or with impaired immune systems may be at increased risk for serious infections. In patients who develop serious infections while on Prolia®, prescribers should assess the need for continued Prolia® therapy.Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsIn the same clinical trial in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, epidermal and dermal adverse events such as dermatitis, eczema and rashes occurred at a significantly higher rate with Prolia® compared to placebo. Most of these events were not specific to the injection site. Consider discontinuing Prolia® if severe symptoms develop.Musculoskeletal PainSevere and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking Prolia®. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop.Suppression of Bone TurnoverIn clinical trials in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, Prolia® resulted in significant suppression of bone remodeling as evidenced by markers of bone turnover and bone histomorphometry. The significance of these findings and the effect of long-term treatment are unknown. Monitor patients for these consequences, including ONJ, atypical fractures, and delayed fracture healing.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (&gt;5% and more common than placebo) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis are back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, hypercholesterolemia, and cystitis. The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 5% and more common than placebo) in men with osteoporosis are back pain, arthralgia, and nasopharyngitis. Pancreatitis has been reported with Prolia®.In women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall incidence of new malignancies was 4.3% in the placebo group and 4.8% in the Prolia® group. In men with osteoporosis, new malignancies were reported in no patients in the placebo group and 4 (3.3%) patients in the Prolia® group. A causal relationship to drug exposure has not been established.The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 3% and more common than active-control group) in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis are back pain, hypertension, bronchitis, and headache.The most common (per patient incidence ≥ 10%) adverse reactions reported with Prolia® in patients with bone loss receiving ADT for prostate cancer or adjuvant AI therapy for breast cancer are arthralgia and back pain. Pain in extremity and musculoskeletal pain have also been reported in clinical trials. Additionally, in Prolia®–treated men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT, a greater incidence of cataracts was observed.Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.Please see full Prolia® Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About TAVNEOS® (avacopan)TAVNEOS (avacopan), approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment for adults with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis, is a first-in-class, orally administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While the precise mechanism in ANCA-associated vasculitis has not been definitively established, TAVNEOS, by blocking the complement 5a receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, is presumed to arrest the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA-associated vasculitis.U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATIONTAVNEOS (avacopan) is indicated as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA] and microscopic polyangiitis [MPA]) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids. TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoid use.IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATIONContraindications: Serious hypersensitivity to avacopan or to any of the excipientsWarning and PrecautionsHepatotoxicity: Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking TAVNEOS, including life-threatening events. Obtain liver test panel before initiating TAVNEOS, every 4 weeks after start of therapy for six months and as clinically indicated thereafter. Monitor patients closely for hepatic adverse reactions, and consider pausing or discontinuing treatment as clinically indicated (refer to section 5.1 of the Prescribing Information). TAVNEOS is not recommended for patients with active, untreated and/or uncontrolled chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Consider the risk and benefit before administering this drug to a patient with liver disease.Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: Cases of angioedema occurred in a clinical trial, including one serious event requiring hospitalization. Discontinue immediately if angioedema occurs and manage accordingly. TAVNEOS must not be re-administered unless another cause has been established.Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: Hepatitis B reactivation, including life threatening hepatitis B, was observed in the clinical program. Screen patients for HBV. For patients with evidence of prior infection, consult with physicians with expertise in HBV and monitor during TAVNEOS therapy and for six months following. If patients develop HBV reactivation, immediately discontinue TAVNEOS and concomitant therapies associated with HBV reactivation, and consult with experts before resuming.Serious Infections: Serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving TAVNEOS. The most common serious infections reported in TAVNEOS group were pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Avoid use of TAVNEOS in patients with active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits before initiating TAVNEOS in patients with chronic infection, at increased risk of infection or who have been to places where certain infections are common.Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increased, and paresthesia.Drug Interactions: Avoid coadministration of TAVNEOS with strong and moderate CYP3A4 enzyme inducers. Reduce TAVNEOS dose when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors to 30 mg once daily. Monitor for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of certain sensitive CYP3A4 substrates.Please see full TAVNEOS Prescribing Information.

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.

139,8f75149e-e056-3d3f-871b-f9e8a0941221,NEM,2022-11-08,Newmont Corporation (NEM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-corporation-nem-trending-stock-140002916.html,1667829602,STORY,['NEM'],"[Newmont Corporation (NEM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this gold and copper miner have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, to which Newmont belongs, has lost 3.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -26.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.89 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -36.2%. This estimate has changed -26.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 indicates a change of +19.1% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -17.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Newmont.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Newmont, the consensus sales estimate of $2.92 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.8%. The $11.81 billion and $12.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.4% and +2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.59%. The EPS surprise was -6.9%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 6.89%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.41%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Macy's as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 17, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.19, down 84.55% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.18 billion, down 4.87% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.13 per share and revenue of $24.47 billion. These totals would mark changes of -22.22% and +0.03%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Macy's. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.09% higher. Macy's is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note Macy's's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 4.74. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.67, so we one might conclude that Macy's is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that M currently has a PEG ratio of 0.4. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Retail - Regional Department Stores stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.76 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Retail - Regional Department Stores industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector.

According to Macy’s, the total financing for the programs will equal $200 million.The money will be offered in the form of loans for working capital, commercial real estate, and growth equity capital. In addition to helping minority businesses, the program will help boost profits for Macy’s by expanding and diversifying its vendor base for customers.“With a lot of these ventures, they’re starting points in helping,” Jessica Ramírez, a retail research analyst at Jane Hali &amp; Associates told the Times. “We have to just see with time.”Access to capital is one of the biggest hurdles for minority entrepreneurs and business owners. Many cannot get funding for startup costs, emergencies, and scaling up their business. According to the Times, Black, Latino, and female business owners receive less than 5% of venture capital funding.The brick-and-mortar retail giant has been trying to diversify its vendor base for several years, starting the Mission Every One program, which will spend $5 billion through 2025 to promote diversity and sustainability in retail. The retail giant also signed the Fifteen Percent Pledge.“We have emphasized a holistic approach in regard to supporting Black businesses, meaning that we work closely with retailers to identify opportunities, beyond just expanded shelf space, to break down barriers that have systematically held back Black entrepreneurs,” LaToya Williams-Belfort, the 15 Percent Pledge executive director said in an email.Many companies and corporations like Macy’s have tried to close the funding gaps for minority entrepreneurs and businesses, but in doing so have discovered that just giving out money isn’t enough.Many corporations have started business accelerator programs that not only provide minority businesses with funding but help minority entrepreneurs scale up their businesses with technological advancements, support, business advice, feedback, and to meet other minority businesses that they can work and collaborate with.]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the retail market, you can skip this article and head on to the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022.The US retail market has continued to grow in recent years and was estimated to occupy a market size of $6.9 trillion in 2022. The country is home to some of the biggest retail stores in the world, with companies like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operating in the country. In 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of the US FED spurred growth in sales of all the retail stores in the country as consumers continued to spend freely in a low-interest rate environment. However, the outlook for big retailers in 2022 has changed as the FED has continued to raise interest rates amidst high inflation. The high rates are expected to slow down the economy and deteriorate the consumer sentiment in the country as people are likely to focus on increasing their savings in the coming months.Contrary to the expectations, the consumer spending is still very robust. Nearly seventy percent of the US economy is consumer spending and the US GDP registered an annualized 2.6% growth during the third quarter. This is why many retail companies have seen an increase in their sales in the current year. However, discount retail stores like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are positive on their outlook for the coming quarters since they are also experiencing a rise in their store traffic as people started to search for discounted prices.Largest Retailers in the US in 2022Niloo / Shutterstock.comEven though the consumer price inflation still hovers around 8%, the overall retail sales has been growing at double digit rates during third quarter. Amazon.com (AMZN), one of the biggest retailers in the US, registered a topline growth rate of 15% during the third quarter, however, the online retail giant guided for an increase of only 5% for the fourth quarter. So, experts and companies are expecting a significant slowdown in retail spending, but we have yet to see this in the reported numbers.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 largest retailers in the United States and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization.15 Largest Retailers in the US in 202215.

The company has the biggest market share in the US, accounting for 20% of the sales in the country. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has been taking several initiatives to improve efficiencies and embarked on a cost-saving program in 2015. The company initially set out to save $1 billion in a 3-year period, but in May 2022, the company revised its target to $3.5 billion in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2024.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund's Q1 2022 investor letter:We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm's US retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer's impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam's Club). However, given management's decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company's progress.11. Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST)Market Cap: $32.28 billionRoss Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) is a leading fashion and clothing retailer in the US, running over 1,700 stores.

The company is the second-biggest price retailer in the US, as per Bank of America Global Research. Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) revenue saw a substantial growth of 51% YoY as it posted a revenue of $18.9 billion during the fiscal year 2022.Here is what Madison Mid Cap Fund has to say about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:Ross Stores is one of our longest-tenured holdings. Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic, first from store closures and shutdowns, then from the pent-up demand for apparel, and more recently, from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that, Ross is finding that consumers' spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual, resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn't appear to be a Ross-specific issue, as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment, and while we don't have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize, we believe it will.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Market Cap: $32.97 billionThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is considered the second-biggest grocer in the United States in terms of market share.

However, the company is poised for further growth as consumers have come under pressure from persistent inflation and are now heading towards discount stores. A new report from Placer.ai stated that the traffic on dollar stores is set to increase as consumers start to adopt a more ""value-focused mindset"".Here is what Madison Funds specifically said about Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) reported strong results on the heels of rolling out the $1.25 price point initiative at all Dollar Tree stores nationwide.

The consumables category accounted for approximately 77% of the company's net sales.Here's what LRT Capital Management said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:Executive SummaryAt LRT Capital Management we are continuously searching the market for great investment opportunities. Our favorite finds are companies with moats and growth opportunities that justify a higher price than what the stock is trading for. One of our holdings (approximately 1.5% of our long exposure) is Dollar General (DG), so today, we wanted to tell you a bit about this great company.Company OverviewDollar General is a discount retailer with the largest brick-and-mortar presence in the United States by store count. The company's largest concentration of stores can be found in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern parts of the United States.10 Dollar General was founded in 1939 by J.L. Turner, who originally named the company ""J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale"".  As the name suggests, the company began its life as a wholesaler, but quickly turned to a retailer of general store goods. By the early 1950s, the company had annual sales of $2 million per year,12 which is the equivalent of $22.95 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation.The first Dollar General store opened on June 01, 1955 in Springfield Kentucky. The simple concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 when Dollar General became publicly traded. At the time of its initial public offering, the business generated more than $40 million in annual sales. The company's common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when it was taken private by KKR. The company went public again in November 2009, under the ticker DG.Today, Dollar General is an evolved, and phenomenal business with more room for growth. Annual sales reached a record $33.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 after consecutively growing the top line for many years. The company's main products are every-day necessities and consumables purchased by lower income consumers on tight budgets…7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Market Cap: $72.67 billionTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the 7th largest retailer in the US, operating 1,938 stores in the country. The company offers a diverse range of products across various categories, including beauty, food and beverage, apparel and accessories, and home furnishings and décor. The company has an employee base of over 400 thousand people across 50 states in the United States.The company has been able to grow its sales significantly during the previous year, as it reported revenue of $104.6 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to $92.4 billion in 2020. Earlier in October, Target and Apple announced a collaboration under which Target will have more locations for Apple products, allowing consumers to buy more of the company's offerings during the holiday season.Ensemble Capital shared its stance on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:Speaking on their earnings call, Target's CEO Brian Cornell said that spending on items such as kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture – products that consumers splurged on while stuck at home – has declined sharply. While they had expected there to be a shift from spending on goods to services as America exited pandemic lifestyles, they didn't anticipate the speed and magnitude of the shift. On the other hand, they saw luggage sales grow by an astounding 50%, along with robust growth in ""going out"" categories such as sunscreen, beauty products, and even toys as families return to hosting large birthday parties for their children. So, despite Target seeing increasing foot traffic and higher spending overall, they got caught with the wrong inventory relative to what customers wanted to buy. What this means for investors is that it is incorrect to say that the consumer is weak, despite weakness in some consumer facing companies. Rather what people are spending money on is changing rapidly, which is good or bad for a given company based on what they sell. Importantly, with demand shifting from items that were in short supply, there is good reason to think that inflation in these categories will moderate. Indeed, Target stated that their plan was to put their excess inventory on sale, something that consumers haven't seen a lot of over the past two years. But as demand for COVID era goods moderates, demand for activities such as travel has surged, driving up inflation in airline tickets and hotel rooms. This illustrates the way that the shock waves from the pandemic have scrambled the typical economic cycle such that even at a time when all signs point to the biggest summer travel season in history, investors are worried that we are headed into, or are already in, a recession.6. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Market Cap: $82.14 billionThe TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a major off-price retailer of clothing, home goods, and other items operating 4,689 stores worldwide. It offers a broad range of branded items at discounted prices via its strategic purchases of inventory from its 21,000 suppliers worldwide. The store typically offers products at a discount in the range of 20%-60% compared to other retailers. The United States is a key geographic location for the company, and in the fiscal year 2022, the region contributed to 79% of the company's overall sales.The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) had a record growth in sales during the fiscal year 2022 as it reported sales of $48.5 billion, up 51% from $32.1 billion in 2021. However, the sales have started to normalize in the current year, and the company's net sales declined by 2% YoY in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy liked the potential post-pandemic customer surge to The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), as revealed in the fund's Q4 2021 investor letter:The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included TJX, an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the US and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022. Suggested Articles:15 Best Strong Buy Stocks to Invest In11 Best Advertising Stocks To Buy NowLargest Airlines in the World in 2022Disclosure: None. 15 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

Nevertheless, increased spending by global air tourists as projected by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in June is expected to aid commercial jet makers.Yet pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to stocks in the aerospace-defense space. Still, recovering air traffic trends should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are General Dynamics, Archer Aviation and Spire Global.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) this June, tourists traveling by air globally in 2022 are projected to spend $672 billion – a sizable increase of 78.2% from the 2021 figure. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace giants, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Story continuesExpanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. House passed the $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act this July, thereby authorizing the U.S. government to spend $37 billion more than what President Joe Biden had requested in his budget for national security spending. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business.In this context, management of Boeing stated in a Reuters report that the company expects supply chain problems to persist almost until the end of 2023, led by labor shortages at mid-tier and smaller suppliers, partly due to the faster-than-expected return of demand. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #89, which places it in the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Beats S&amp;P 500, Lags SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite but underperformed its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 8.2% compared with the Aerospace sector’s decline of 5.4%. In contrast, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has gone down 21.3% in the said timeframe.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for valuing capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.96, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.18 and the sector’s 2.26.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.96X, as low as 1.34X, and at the median of 1.64X.3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep on Your WatchlistArcher Aviation: Based in San Jose, CA, Archer Aviation is involved in designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for use in urban air mobility. The company recently announced that it will launch its first electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft named Midnight at an Open House event on Nov 16, 2022. With the rapidly growing demand for eVTOL aircraft in air transportation, such a product innovation should bolster ACHR’s position in the concerned market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Archer Aviation’s 2022 loss implies a solid improvement from the 2021 reported figure. ACHR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Spire Global: Based in Vienna, VA, Spire Global is a provider of space-based data, analytics and space services. Earlier this month, the company won a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to deliver a preliminary design for a satellite that would carry an array of sensors to very low Earth orbit for in-situ ionosphere measurements. With the U.S. government emphasizing on space exploration and associated development, this contract win should position Spire Global at an advantageous place in the expanding space market.Spire Global currently boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.9%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 35.71% in the last reported quarter.  SPIR currently holds a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.General Dynamics: Based in Falls Church, VA, General Dynamics is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines and a leader in surface combatants and auxiliary ship design and construction for the U.S. Navy. It is also a premier manufacturer and integrator of land combat solutions worldwide, along with renowned business jets. The company expects G800 customer deliveries to begin in 2023, while G400 deliveries are anticipated to begin in 2025. This should bolster General Dynamics’ position in the aircraft market.GD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.3%. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 2.42% in the last four quarters.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Assertio has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Zoetis has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ASRT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.26, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 27.14. We also note that ASRT has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

The sector is one of the most important industries in the country, contributing significantly to its GDP. According to a report published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the US has the world’s largest capital markets, representing 41% of global equity. The country’s markets also fund 72% of its domestic economic activity. The report also mentioned that the US has over $760 billion worth of foreign investment in its financial sector, which is currently providing resources for a wide range of businesses.Over the years, the finance sector globally has evolved a lot due to the induction of digital channels, which has significantly contributed to the sector’s returns and growth. According to a report by IBISWorld, the finance and insurance sector in the US is currently valued at over $5.7 trillion and has grown 2.5% per year on average in the last five years. The implementation of digital channels has further resulted in the industry’s impressive growth. Bloomberg cited Data Bridge Market Research’s new report, which highlighted that the digital insurance platform market will grow at a CAGR of 13.7% from 2022 to 2029. The growth will be attributed to the rising use of IoT products and cloud-based digital solutions.Economists around the world are of the view that inflation is expected to last well into next year as well. They recommend investors load up on safe stocks that have the ability to generate stable income in current times. The S&amp;P 500 Financial index is down 13.3% year-to-date, versus a 21.3% decline in the broader market. According to Hartford Funds, financials have performed better during past inflationary pressures because of their stable cash flows. Moreover, strong cash flows signal solid dividends which are comforting in times of financial turmoil.Story continuesSome investors are considering long-term bonds that yield more than 4%. We believe these are ok investments but don't provide any upside potential. Some financial stocks declined by more than 30% in anticipation of a US recession and offer attractive yields. We expect these stocks to deliver large capital gains as well after the stock market hits its bottom. Bearing this in mind, we will discuss some of the best financial dividend stocks to invest in. Some of the popular dividend stocks in the sector include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).Best Financial Dividend Stocks to BuyInvestments, FinanceOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that belong to different segments within the finance industry, such as insurance, financial services, credit card services, and banking.

(NYSE:V) continues to report strong double-digit growth in payment volumes throughout the first two months of the calendar third quarter. The stock suffered after concerns about potential adverse legislation related to its credit card routing practices began to surface. Similar legislation related to the Company’s debit routing practices was passed into law back in 2010. Not unlike the previous legislation, the Company’s value proposition to merchants, consumers and bank-issuing customers and acquirers is robust enough to help blunt the potential effects the legislation might have in the near term. Over a multiyear time horizon, it would be quite difficult for any currently non-existent or even sub-scale credit routing network to add the value that Visa (or MasterCard) can already add today.”10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 1.07%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics. In Q3 2022, the company reported revenue of $2.86 billion, which showed a 36.8% growth from the same period last year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9.

The newly published 2023 Global Trade Outlook is part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Big Picture 2023 Outlook Report Series. The new report highlights the anticipated shifts in trade due to the Russia–Ukraine conflict as well as positive outlook for containerized trade in 2023 despite a mere 0.7% year-on-year (y/y) growth in 2022 led by the estimated slowdown in the second half. It also highlights the impact of the new International Maritime Organization (IMO) greenhouse gas reduction measures that will be introduced in 2023.""The trade value of total imports from Russia has increased in recent months, primarily due to rising oil, gas and coal prices, as well as spikes in Russian imports by several countries. This group is led by India, which noted a greater than 100% y/y increase in Russian import trade values each month after the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in February 2022,"" said Agnieszka Maciejewska, Economics Manager at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.Key highlights from the report include:Global shifts in trade: India is forecast to see an acceleration in trade in 2023, thanks to its significant increase in imports from Russia. Its trade value is projected to increase by 3.5% y/y in exports and by 1.3% y/y in imports, while its trade volume is projected to grow 3.8% y/y and 7.3% y/y, respectively.Mainland China is expected to be the biggest importer from Russia in 2023, followed by Turkey, Belarus and Kazakhstan. However, China's current economic slowdown adds considerable uncertainty to the outlook. Western trading partners will lose their significance in Russia's trade turnover. This trend will become even more visible if Russia cuts gas supplies to Europe in the winter of 2022–23.Containerized trade outlook: S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Global Trade Analytics Suite (GTAS) forecasting projects containerized trade to increase by 3.2% y/y in 2023, following a 0.7% y/y growth in 2022.U.S. container imports is forecast to grow 5.9% y/y in 2022 and 4.2% y/y in 2023. With U.S. warehouses being full, major carriers started removing capacity on the Asia-US trade lane, although not yet on a massive scale. With no peak season this year, carriers will take out a significant amount of capacity to protect and boost their rates.With mainland China's containerized exports accounting for more than 50% of its total exports, this type of cargo should face significant long-term impacts from the country's economic challenges, a situation not expected to change anytime soon.IMO decarbonization goals: Beginning January 1, 2023, the maritime industry, which is highly dependent on fossil fuels, will have to comply with the new short-term greenhouse gas reduction measures implemented by the IMO. This will likely result in higher average increase in maritime logistics costs and a slowdown, albeit marginally, in global trade and economic growth.Story continuesTotal container tradeTo request a copy of the 2023 Global Trade Outlook, please contact pressinquiries.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, quotes, and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security.About S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence At S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, we understand the importance of accurate, deep and insightful information.

The sector is one of the most important industries in the country, contributing significantly to its GDP. According to a report published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the US has the world’s largest capital markets, representing 41% of global equity. The country’s markets also fund 72% of its domestic economic activity. The report also mentioned that the US has over $760 billion worth of foreign investment in its financial sector, which is currently providing resources for a wide range of businesses.Over the years, the finance sector globally has evolved a lot due to the induction of digital channels, which has significantly contributed to the sector’s returns and growth. According to a report by IBISWorld, the finance and insurance sector in the US is currently valued at over $5.7 trillion and has grown 2.5% per year on average in the last five years. The implementation of digital channels has further resulted in the industry’s impressive growth. Bloomberg cited Data Bridge Market Research’s new report, which highlighted that the digital insurance platform market will grow at a CAGR of 13.7% from 2022 to 2029. The growth will be attributed to the rising use of IoT products and cloud-based digital solutions.Economists around the world are of the view that inflation is expected to last well into next year as well. They recommend investors load up on safe stocks that have the ability to generate stable income in current times. The S&amp;P 500 Financial index is down 13.3% year-to-date, versus a 21.3% decline in the broader market. According to Hartford Funds, financials have performed better during past inflationary pressures because of their stable cash flows. Moreover, strong cash flows signal solid dividends which are comforting in times of financial turmoil.Story continuesSome investors are considering long-term bonds that yield more than 4%.

(NYSE:V) continues to report strong double-digit growth in payment volumes throughout the first two months of the calendar third quarter. The stock suffered after concerns about potential adverse legislation related to its credit card routing practices began to surface. Similar legislation related to the Company’s debit routing practices was passed into law back in 2010. Not unlike the previous legislation, the Company’s value proposition to merchants, consumers and bank-issuing customers and acquirers is robust enough to help blunt the potential effects the legislation might have in the near term. Over a multiyear time horizon, it would be quite difficult for any currently non-existent or even sub-scale credit routing network to add the value that Visa (or MasterCard) can already add today.”10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 1.07%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics.

(NYSE:SPGI), down from 97 in the previous quarter. These stakes hold a collective value of over $7.2 billion.Baron Funds mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9.

Willscot Mobile Mini is another compounder that executed well through the pandemic but was not initially recognized for the synergies of its Mobile Mini acquisition. The deal has reduced costs and created greater operating leverage as the company rides the tailwinds of improving industrial production and construction.”6.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.9bUS$13.8bUS$15.5bUS$17.8bUS$19.5bUS$21.0bUS$22.2bUS$23.2bUS$24.0bUS$24.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 9.58%Est @ 7.3%Est @ 5.7%Est @ 4.59%Est @ 3.8%Est @ 3.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$11.1kUS$12.0kUS$12.6kUS$13.5kUS$13.8kUS$13.8kUS$13.6kUS$13.3kUS$12.8kUS$12.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$129bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$483bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$483b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$240bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$369b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$318, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mastercard as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.022. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether QUALCOMM's current trading price of US$110 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM What's The Opportunity In QUALCOMM?Great news for investors – QUALCOMM is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $169.66, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because QUALCOMM’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will QUALCOMM generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -16% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for QUALCOMM. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although QCOM is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to QCOM, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on QCOM for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing QUALCOMM at this point in time. Be aware that QUALCOMM is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis and 2 of those don't sit too well with us...If you are no longer interested in QUALCOMM, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

The share price has now given up all its gains since February 2019, which at one point amounted to 775%Revenue for the third quarter was $761 mln, up 12% from a year ago and well ahead of consensus estimates - although those estimates have been lowered significantly over the last few months. On a GAAP basis, the company lost $0.88 a share, which was also much better than expected but compared to positive $0.52 a year ago.Total net revenue for the fourth quarter is now expected to be about $800 mln, versus estimates of $884 mln (that were closer to $1.2 bln a few months ago).Our take: There wasn’t much to like about these results, and the immediate future looks bleak. However, there was one metric that is encouraging and worth keeping an eye on going forward.During the last quarter,Active users increased 16% YoY to 65.4 millionTotal hours streamed increased 21% YoY to 21.9 billionThe average revenue per user increased 10% YoY to $44.25The increase in active users isn't very exciting, and the increase in ARPU was disappointing. But the total hours streamed continues to rise and it's been rising all year despite the end of lockdown restrictions.Ad spending is under pressure at the moment, so Roku has obviously struggled to monetize the increase in viewing hours. But the total number of streaming hours will be important when ad spend does begin to increase again. As consumers switch from cable TV to streaming services, advertisers have limited options - and Roku is one of those options.Story continuesOur full analysis of ROKU provides a more comprehensive picture of the company’s financials and several risks to be aware of.Etsy is doing well given the current environmentShares of Etsy ( Nasdaq: ETSY ) traded as much as 16% higher on Thursday after the e-commerce platform announced better-than-expected sales and raised guidance. Gross merchandise value of $3 billion was down 3.3% YoY, while revenue of $594 mln was 11.7% higher than a year ago. The net loss widened to $963 mln due to an impairment charge.The good news came in the form of guidance for the fourth quarter as the company expects GMV to increase to between $3.6 and $4 bln.Revenue rose while gross merchandise sales were flat. This was partly a result of raising the commission Esty charges on transactions, but also due to additional services it provides to customers.Our take: Etsy’s GMV, revenue, and net income have been relatively flat over the last two years. The jump in the share price was a response to the company beating very low expectations.But Etsy did provide some encouraging data which shows that the company is building a loyal customer base.Nasdaq: ETSY KPIs - Company presentationThese numbers suggest that customers are more engaged but are now spending less on each transaction. This makes sense when we consider the effect of inflation on discretionary budgets.Etsy is a unique platform with a loyal customer base. It's probably going to struggle to grow in the current economic environment but will be a company to watch when conditions change.Have a look at the  full analysis of Etsy for more details.Qualcomm sinks on falling smartphone demandQualcomm ( Nasdaq: QCOM ) reported mixed results, but also lowered guidance for the current quarter. The share price fell 7.45% in response, and it's now down 25% over the last 12 months, and 43% year to date.Quarterly sales of $11.4 bln were up 22.1% from a year ago and ahead of consensus estimates. Non-GAAP EPS were also up 22% to $ 3.13 which is what analysts expected. GAAP EPS were lower than expected and only 3.8% higher than a year ago.The company now expects first-quarter revenue of $9.2 to $10 bln, compared to the previous estimate of 12.05 bln. The company also said that smartphone demand was falling and that customers are drawing down on inventory as supply chain restraints have eased.Our take: Qualcomm stands out amongst its peers due to its strong cash flows and 2.9% dividend yield. The company has managed to increase its dividend every year for the last decade - but you may be wondering how sustainable it is if the company experiences an ongoing slowdown.The payout ratio is currently 24% of earnings and 49% of cash flow. Free cash flow has already fallen quite a lot over the last year - but the dividend coverage still appears to be sustainable. It would take a very dramatic drop in cash flow to put the current yield at risk.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NYSE:BAX), a global innovator in kidney care, advanced scientific exchange with 14 new data presentations about the role innovation plays in increasing access to and quality of home dialysis and expanded hemodialysis (HDx) care at Kidney Week 2022, Nov. 3-6, Orlando, Florida. Key data highlighted include:A study indicating a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and fluid balance, and cardiovascular and metabolic related adverse events, in home automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients with Sharesource remote patient management (RPM) versus APD patients without RPM, ""Adverse Events and Hospitalizations with Remote Patient Monitoring of Patients on Automated Peritoneal Dialysis"" [Abstract #FR-PO504].A simulated dialysis study indicating expanded hemodialysis (HDx) enabled by Theranova demonstrates the best balance when aiming to achieve higher clearance of larger molecular weight middle molecules while minimizing albumin loss, ""On the Removal of Middle Molecules and Albumin Loss: An Ex Vivo Evaluation of Commercial Dialyzers"" [Abstract #SA-PO405].""With a growing global deficit between the number of patients with kidney disease and those receiving care, we believe a combination of collaboration, education and innovation is necessary to help increase both access to and quality of care,"" said Peter Rutherford, MB BS, PhD., vice president, Medical Affairs, Baxter Renal Care. ""Scientific exchange is an important part of the collaboration and education initiatives, which we are very pleased to support at this year’s Kidney Week.""Story continuesSharesource Remote Patient ManagementBaxter’s Sharesource RPM digital health platform allows healthcare professionals to monitor their patients’ home dialysis treatments, and then remotely adjust therapy without the need for patients to make unplanned visits to the clinic. Sharesource is currently serving more than 50,000 patients, across more than 70 countries on Baxter’s APD cyclers. The RPM study [Abstract #FR-PO504] presented at Kidney Week 2022 was a cluster randomized, controlled trial, at 21 hospitals across Mexico, where care units were randomly assigned to treat their APD patients with or without RPM.HDx Enabled by TheranovaHDx enabled by Theranova removes a wider range of molecules from the blood than traditional HD filters, like high-flux membranes, by targeting the effective removal of large middle molecules (up to 45,000 Da),1,2,3 while selectively retaining essential proteins and maintaining stable albumin levels.4,5,6 These middle molecules have been linked to the development of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and other co-morbidities in dialysis patients.7,8The new Theranova data [Abstract #SA-PO405] comes from a simulated study that evaluated the challenges associated with increased removal of larger middle molecules while avoiding clinically relevant albumin loss during a dialysis session. During the study, four commercial dialyzers with comparable surface areas were carefully evaluated for solute clearance and albumin loss during four-hour simulated hemodialysis treatments under standardized conditions.Theranova had significantly higher small and large middle molecule clearance (up to 2-3 times higher for YKL40) than two of the other dialyzers as well as lower albumin loss. One dialyzer cleared a higher volume of large middle molecules, but demonstrated albumin loss more than double that observed with Theranova. The study shows further assessment of the dialyzer’s performance in clinic studies is necessary to better understand the benefits of these findings.HDx enabled by Theranova is currently available in 54 countries across Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and in the United States and Canada. More than nine million dialysis treatments have been performed worldwide using Theranova in more than 850 clinics. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Theranova a De Novo application in 2020, which established it as a new class of dialyzer technology with unique performance standards.The Theranova Dialyzer is indicated for patients with chronic kidney failure who are prescribed intermittent hemodialysis. It provides an expanded solute removal profile with increased removal of various middle molecules (up to 45 kDa) that may play a pathologic role in the uremic clinical syndrome. The Theranova Dialyzer is not intended for hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration therapy. The total extracorporeal blood volume for the Theranova Dialyzer and the set should represent less than 10% of the patient's blood volume.Rx Only: For safe and proper use of the devices mentioned herein, refer to the Instructions for Use.About BaxterEvery day, millions of patients, caregivers and healthcare providers rely on Baxter’s leading portfolio of diagnostic, critical care, kidney care, nutrition, hospital and surgical products used across patient homes, hospitals, physician offices and other sites of care.

If you want to see more of the best blue chip stocks to buy today, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.2022 has been a challenging year for many stocks in the market.Given the high inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year and many analysts think the central bank will raise the rate even further.With the higher interest rates, the U.S. consumer has less spending power and consumer demand is lower. With lower demand, companies are not investing as much, especially given that the cost of debt is also higher.Similarly, the rising interest rates have increased U.S. Treasury yields substantially and the higher Treasury yields have made stocks less attractive to some investors.As a result of the headwinds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 11.4% year to date while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 21.4% year to date. The NASDAQ has fallen the most, declining almost 34% year to date.Like the Dow Jones, many blue chip stocks have declined substantially in terms of their stock prices year to date. Given that many blue chip companies have strong competitive advantages and growth potential, however, some leading blue chips could be good buys in terms of long term investments as valuations potentially return closer to normal if the Federal Reserve successfully contains inflation.In the near term, however, there is uncertainty even for blue chips if economic data fails to meet expectations. Many analysts think there could be a recession next year and the Federal Reserve has signaled it isn't done raising rates.In addition to rising rates domestically, the international economy could face headwinds given that China's exports fell in October for the first time in over two years. With China's exports falling 0.3% in October in dollar terms year over year, global aggregate demand could be potentially weaker than expected.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that we think have upside in terms of the long term given their competitive advantages and growth potential. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 blue chips stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stocks at the end of Q2 2022.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today12. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is an industrial conglomerate whose shares declined in 2020 due to the pandemic, which weakened demand for GE aviation. With the interest rate increases and the broader market weakness, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) shares have declined again by slightly over 14% year to date in 2022. Nevertheless, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has quality businesses and quality earnings power that could give the stock upside in the long term.Longleaf Partners commented on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a blue chip stock that's owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Although Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is down around 2.57% year to date, the company's stock has done a lot better than the three major indexes as the leading retailer has benefited from more demand. Given the higher inflation, more consumers are looking for the best prices, and often Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stores are among the most competitive. If it can maintain its market share and keep its new customers, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) could continue to grow earnings for the future.10. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71As a maker of premium consumer staple brands, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been negatively affected by higher inflation. As a result, shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have declined by 17.8% year to date. Nevertheless, there's hope that the Federal Reserve will successfully win its battle against inflation in a year or two. If that happens, demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) premium brands could normalize again.9. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80Given the interest rate increases, the 30 year fixed mortgage rate is around 7.23% or more than double what it was a year ago. Given the higher mortgage rates, demand for homes has decreased, and demand for home improvement products has weakened too. As a result, leading home improvement retailer The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stock has fallen 31.6% year to date. Although interest rates could go higher before they go lower, there's hope the Federal Reserve will win its battle against inflation. If that happens, interest rates could normalize and demand for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) could normalize too. Currently shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) trade for a forward P/E ratio of 16.4, which could be an attractive valuation if the company grows EPS at the rate that analysts expect in the next five years.8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83 Although the broader market might have declined substantially in 2022, shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are up around 0.24% year to date. In the longer term, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is also in an uptrend as the company continues to grow earnings per share given its innovative products and the pricing power of its consumer brands. Currently shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) trade for a forward P/E of 16.5, which is pretty attractive given the company's competitive advantages and earnings power.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has benefited from the higher interest rates with higher net interest income, which rose 51% year over year in the third quarter. While JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s net interest income rose, the bank's net profit nevertheless fell 17% given it set aside $808 million in reserves. If there is a recession next year, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is among the best prepared banks given its balance sheet. In the long term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has upside given its quality earnings potential.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares are down 35.7% year to date given some of the company's businesses such as its theme parks are pretty economically sensitive. Disney+'s valuation has also decreased in 2022 given the decline of Netflix's valuation this year. Nevertheless, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has many high quality businesses that will likely increase in value in the long term if they maintain their market share.Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are blue chip stocks that are owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.Suggested articles:22 Biggest Economies in the World in 202215 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market CapDisclosure: None. 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

186,ab0cbc4e-3e96-3a19-b313-9152fb3d378e,MDT,2022-11-08,SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study demonstrates meaningful clinical benefits consistent with other SPYRAL HTN renal denervation trials,CNW Group,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spyral-htn-med-study-demonstrates-213800544.html,1667857080,STORY,['MDT'],"[DUBLIN and CHICAGO, Nov. 7, 2022 /CNW/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced the six-month results from the full cohort of the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED clinical trial. The data were presented today as Late-Breaking Clinical Science at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2022. With this news, Medtronic has submitted the final module of the Symplicity Spyral™ Premarket Approval (PMA) package to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review and approval.Subjects who were prescribed antihypertensive medications and were treated with the Medtronic Symplicity Spyral Renal Denervation (RDN) System had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in office-based systolic blood pressure (OSBP), a key secondary endpoint, compared to subjects in the sham control group. However, in the primary endpoint, RDN did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (ABPM) due to increased medications in the sham control group and the potential impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the clinical trial environment. The study also included Win Ratio, a pre-specified secondary endpoint that combines reduction in blood pressure with reduction in medication burden, which enables assessment of the overall beneficial effect of RDN. The Win Ratio demonstrated significance in favor of RDN versus a sham procedure. Finally, the study met its primary safety endpoint, with a low incidence of procedure-related and clinical adverse events.""The ON MED study demonstrated significant reductions in office-based blood pressure, the most commonly used measure in clinical practice. Additionally, we saw reductions in absolute blood pressure that were consistent with earlier RDN studies,"" said David Kandzari, M.D., chief, Piedmont Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Services and SPYRAL HTN-ON MED lead principal investigator. ""Surprisingly, 24-hour ABPM declined with RDN but did not differ from the sham group, and the primary endpoint was not met. More than 80% of patients in the ON MED expansion group experienced follow up during the Covid-19 pandemic. Compared with patients enrolled before the pandemic, significant differences in baseline 24-hour ABPM were observed that may reflect changes in patient behavior and lifestyle during the pandemic.1,2,3 Additionally, patients treated with the sham procedure increased the amount of medication they were taking compared to those treated with RDN. These factors likely contributed to the smaller than expected differences in ABPM.""Story continuesSPYRAL HTN-ON MED is a global, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigating the blood pressure lowering effect and safety of RDN with the radiofrequency (RF)-based Symplicity Spyral RDN system in hypertensive patients who have been prescribed up to three anti-hypertensive medications, including diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE/ARB inhibitors or beta blockers. A total of 337 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were enrolled at 42 sites across the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada, and were randomized 2:1 to RDN (n=205) versus sham control (n=132). Results were as follows:The primary Bayesian efficacy endpoint of 24-hr systolic ABPM reduction was not met, with a 51% probability of superiority for the RDN group versus those who received a sham control procedure. However, nighttime systolic ABPM reduction was statistically significant.The study met the prespecified secondary endpoint, which was the change in OSBP from baseline to six-month follow-up between the RDN group (n=199) and the sham control group (n=126).The study met the primary safety endpoint, evaluating major adverse events at one-month post-procedure, and renal artery stenosis at six-months, pooled across the SPYRAL HTN-ON and OFF MED studies (p&lt;0.001)The Win Ratio demonstrated significance in favor of RDN versus a sham procedure (p=0.005).Overall burden of medications was higher in the sham control group at six-months (p=0.04).""Renal denervation lowers blood pressure and requires less medication for patients with hypertension,"" said Laura Mauri, M.D., chief scientific, medical, and regulatory officer at Medtronic. ""It is also a safe procedure. In this study specifically, RDN met both the safety endpoint for this trial, as well as the overall safety endpoint across the SPYRAL HTN ON and OFF MED studies.""The SPYRAL HTN-ON MED Trial4 is a part of the Medtronic SPYRAL HTN Global Clinical Program – the most comprehensive clinical program studying RDN - including the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Pivotal Trial5 and the currently-enrolling SPYRAL AFFIRM Study. Along with the real-world data from the Global SYMPLICITY Registry (GSR)6, the Medtronic RDN program is backed by experience in more than 20,000 patients treated globally, studied in the presence and absence of medication, and in patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk.""In addition to the consistent absolute blood pressure drops that we have demonstrated across trials, long-term data from key Medtronic studies— which were highlighted in two important publications this year in The Lancet7,8— have also demonstrated the durability and 'always on' effect of RDN,"" said Jason Weidman, senior vice president and president of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""The ON MED results presented today serve as an additional piece of our extensive compendium of safety and efficacy evidence on this procedure. With these results in hand, we submitted our PMA package to the FDA, which includes the totality of available evidence from the SPYRAL HTN clinical program. We are excited about the potential to bring this important procedure to millions of U.S. patients in need.""Approved for commercial use in more than 60 countries around the world, the Symplicity Spyral RDN system is limited to investigational use in the United States, Japan, and Canada.Investor and Analyst BriefingMedtronic will host a webcast of its Renal Denervation Investors and Analyst Briefing on Monday, November 7, 2022 from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. CST.

Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Abbott (NYSE: ABT)Gary S. Guthart, Chief Executive Officer, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG)Geoff Martha, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Medtronic (NYSE: MDT)More than 50 CEOs to date have presented their Long-Term Plans at the CEO Investor Forum to an audience of institutional investors, representing $25 trillion in assets under management. The next CEO Investor Forum for climate leaders will be held in New York on June 2023; watch cecp.co for more information.Key themes from the Long-Term Plan presentations emerged including:In medtech and other industries, material issues of ESG need to be relevant and seen as a critical part of the entire business strategy, not just one department. This includes material issues other than financial capital-including intellectual capital, human capital, and social capital-to drive overall competitiveness.The COVID-19 pandemic was a pivotal moment in healthcare, helping fuel perpetual value creation, particularly as many companies realized that technology has unlimited growth potential. This including increasing access, reducing cost, and transforming discoveries of the human body. AI and machine learning are increasingly turning quality data into insights used in solutions to help guide better care.Supply chain issues cannot be solved by any one company alone. It takes a systems approach where government, non-profit organizations, and even competitors are collaborating across the value chain to re-wire the whole system.Story continues""The CEO Investor Forum @ The MedTech Conference brought together companies, institutional investors, and professional services firms committed to reorienting our capital markets toward the long-term,"" said Daryl Brewster, CEO, CECP.

Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Abbott. ""Our plan has one overarching imperative - to design access and affordability into our products from the start to get our products to the most people possible.

""Rooted in an enduring mission to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life, Medtronic is combining the application of biomedical engineering with the power of data science to exponentially expand the impact of healthcare technology.

191,25cd6a08-2668-3dec-9a22-bb543bfa001d,MRK,2022-11-08,"Insiders at Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) sold US$2.8m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-merck-co-inc-nyse-120101459.html,1667908861,STORY,['MRK'],"[Over the past year, many Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Merck The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MerckThe Executive VP &amp; General Counsel, Jennifer Zachary, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.7m worth of shares at a price of US$99.85 each. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$100, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 30% of Jennifer Zachary's stake.Insiders in Merck didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Merck Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Merck. In total, insiders dumped US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Merck insiders own about US$188m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Merck Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Merck stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Merck is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Merck and we suggest you have a look.Of course Merck may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc., ConocoPhillips and Adobe Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Merck’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+20.0% vs. +7.6%). The company’s drugs like Keytruda, Gardasil vaccine and Bridion have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, has become a key top-line driver in 2022. However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line.There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade. Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry this year so far.(You can read the full research report on Merck here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of ConocoPhillips have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry over the past year (+74.2% vs. +72.0%). The company holds a bulk of acres in the unconventional plays of Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale. Significant opportunities are there for the firm in the Bakken Shale, where it owns about 750 undrilled locations that could provide access to huge reserves.Story continuesCOP projects its 2022 production at 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoe/d), suggesting an increase from 1.6 MMBoe/d last year. COP’s balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to. Also, it approved a $20-billion increase in the existing share repurchase program to $45 billion.However, COP is highly exposed to oil price fluctuations, which makes things challenging for the company. Also, it has been generating lower dividend yield than the industry over the past few years. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on ConocoPhillips here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Adobe have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-57.1% vs. -37.2%). The company is facing headwinds for the Digital Media segment due to the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine conflict. Nevertheless, Adobe is benefiting from strong demand for its cloud products.The company’s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are helping it drive top-line growth. Rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps remain major positives.Growth in emerging markets, robust online video creation demand, strong Acrobat adoption and improving average revenue per user remain tailwinds.

Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has become a key top-line driver in 2022. However, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line.There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 10.26%.The British drugmaker’s performance has been decent, with earnings beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one. The company delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.88%, on average.AstraZeneca PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAstraZeneca PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAstraZeneca PLC price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | AstraZeneca PLC QuoteAstraZeneca’s stock has risen 4.7% this year so far compared with an increase of 2.7% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to ConsiderSales of AstraZeneca’s key medicines, mainly cancer drugs — Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi — and diabetes medicine Farxiga are expected to have driven the company’s top line in the third quarter backed by strong demand trends. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi are $724 million, $1.44 billion, and $682 million, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Farxiga is $1.16 billion.Please note that AstraZeneca markets Lynparza in partnership with Merck MRK.AstraZeneca and Merck formed a profit-sharing deal to co-market Lynparza and Koselugo in July 2017.AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indicationsAstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail medicine for COVID-19 Evusheld is likely to have been a key contributor to the top line. However, the sales contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria is likely to have been minimum. It is however to be seen how the receding impact of the pandemic has affected the demand of Evusheld.AstraZeneca’s other drugs, Fasenra, Calquence and newer products, triple combo COPD treatment Breztri and lupus drug, Saphnelo (anifrolumab) are likely to have contributed to sales growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fasenra, and Calquence are $379 million and $535 million, respectively.Story continuesProduct sales of some drugs like Brilinta/Brilique and Pulmicort in the past few quarters have been hurt due to COVID-related disruptions and pricing pressure from the VBP (volume-based procurement) program in China. The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter.Sales of AstraZeneca’s major legacy drugs have been declining due to rising generic competition. The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter.Sales of AstraZeneca’s Rare Disease drugs like Ultomiris and Strensiq, which were added following the Alexion acquisition, are also expected to have been higher, thus contributing to the top line.Overall, sales in China are likely to have been hurt due to pricing pressure associated with the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and VBP programs, which are expected to have been offset by strong growth in ex-China emerging markets. It remains to be seen if the residual impact of the pandemic might have hurt the diagnosis and treatment rates of cancer medicines.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AstraZeneca this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

This 1 Stock Could Be the Perfect Pick,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investor-1-stock-could-144002262.html,1667832002,STORY,['MRK'],"[For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.Many investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.Merck (MRK)Based in Kenilworth, NJ, Merck &amp; Co. boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda has played an instrumental role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years. Though Keytruda may be Merck’s biggest strength and a solid reason to own the stock, it can also be argued that Merck is excessively dependent on the drug and should look for ways to diversify its product lineup.MRK is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, with a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of A. Shares are currently trading at a forward P/E of 13.5X for the current fiscal year compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's P/E of 13.5X. Additionally, MRK has a PEG Ratio of 1.3 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 13.6X. Value investors should also note MRK's Price/Sales ratio of 4.3X.A company's earnings performance is important for value investors as well. For fiscal 2022, five analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for MRK, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.02 to $7.38 per share. MRK also holds an average earnings surprise of 16.1%.Investors should take the time to consider MRK for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings and valuation metrics, and impressive Value and VGM Style Scores.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.35 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -8.52%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this fertilizer maker would post earnings of $3.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.64, delivering a surprise of -7.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.Mosaic , which belongs to the Zacks Fertilizers industry, posted revenues of $5.35 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.01%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.42 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mosaic shares have added about 25.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.9%.What's Next for Mosaic?While Mosaic has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mosaic: unfavorable.

198,176b7736-1a95-3923-a9ce-bea60fc986b0,MOS,2022-11-08,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Could Become A Multi-Bagger,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-could-become-181645208.html,1667845005,STORY,['MOS'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Mosaic's (NYSE:MOS) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Mosaic:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$4.7b ÷ (US$24b - US$5.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Mosaic has an ROCE of 25%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Mosaic compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsMosaic is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 945% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 23% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. Keep an eye out for future increases because when the ratio of current liabilities to total assets gets particularly high, this can introduce some new risks for the business.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Mosaic's ROCETo sum it up, Mosaic is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Mosaic that you might find interesting.Mosaic is not the only stock earning high returns.

The (WMB). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Both Evergy Inc and Williams Companies, Inc. The have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.EVRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.45, while WMB has a forward P/E of 21.53. We also note that EVRG has a PEG ratio of 3.33. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WMB currently has a PEG ratio of 6.15.Another notable valuation metric for EVRG is its P/B ratio of 1.49. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

COMAC plans the first C919 delivery to China Eastern in December.TURNING POINTAnalysts say it will be some time before the C919 cracks open an entrenched Airbus-Boeing market duopoly outside China, but Tuesday's display marked a turning point 10 years after first orders were unveiled at the same event.By contrast, the sun was setting in China on Tuesday on one of Europe's most visible global symbols, the double-decker A380.Tracking website FlightRadar24 said China Southern Airlines operated its last A380 flight from Los Angeles on Tuesday. The airline did not answer a request for comment.Production of the world's largest jetliner ended last year after weak sales including a near-failure to conquer China's market. An auction of A380 parts was held in France last month.Analysts say Airbus does however enjoy brisk demand for the best-selling A320neo, buoyed by U.S. tensions that have delayed renewed Boeing MAX deliveries following a safety crisis.Airbus on Tuesday formally booked an order for 40 A320neo-family jets from all-Boeing operator Xiamen Airlines.China watchers said the airline's decision to loosen its dependence on Boeing was viewed as particularly symbolic after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the cockpit of a larger Xiamen 787 on a visit to Boeing's Seattle-area factory in 2015.Europe also made new inroads with the certification for Chinese markets of its ATR 42-600 turboprop after a long wait.The show unfolded against the backdrop of rising tensions between China and Taiwan after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August, sparking huge Chinese military exercises at a time when the world is also on edge over the Ukraine conflict.State-owned Global Times reported that a new anti-drone defence system built around the HQ-17AE short-range air defence missile complex would make its Zhuhai debut as a countermeasure for low, slow and small drones that are difficult to identify and attack with traditional anti-air systems.China is also showing off a FH-97A ""Loyal Wingman"" drone model designed to coordinate with crewed aircraft, the newspaper reported. The aircraft is different from the FH-97 concept first displayed last year.The FH-97 is nearly identical to the U.S.-developed Kratos Defense and Security Solutions XQ-58A Valkyrie, which first flew in 2019, while the FH-97A looks more like Boeing's Australian-developed MQ-28 Ghost Bat, photographs indicate.""Early images from the show suggest it will again be a major bazaar of Chinese UAV technology, including what appear to be mockups of unmanned combat aircraft that could one day accompany Chinese J-20 fighters into combat,"" Waldron said.""Still, it can be very hard to understand if the various UAV models at the show represent real programmes with investment from the Chinese military.""

211,dc3dacee-429f-37d5-80ab-8719322f40a4,ILMN,2022-11-08,Rarebase Is on the Hunt for Therapeutic Opportunities,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rarebase-hunt-therapeutic-opportunities-144000630.html,1667832000,STORY,['ILMN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 7, 2022 / San Francisco Bay Area residents Jainu and Shruti Jogani had their newborn daughter, Reyna, at home for nearly three weeks when they noticed her exhibiting seizure-like symptoms-episodes so quick they weren't able to capture them on video. Standard blood work, MRI scans, and EKGs all came back normal, except for a gene panel for epilepsy. In addition, symptoms such as weaker vision persisted, and the parents braced themselves for the worst.When Reyna's genetic sequencing results revealed a CDKL5 deficiency around her three-month birthday, Jainu and Shruti began to understand the challenging journey that awaited their family. They opted for whole-genome sequencing, to better understand the extent of the mutation, and perhaps help with research-based treatment options like Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO). The rare disorder, caused by mutations in its namesake gene, affects one in 40,000 to 60,000 newborns-and, curiously, about 90 percent of those diagnosed are girls.At a meetup for families affected by rare diseases, Jainu met Onno Faber and Omid Karkouti, co-founders of Rarebase, a precision medicine company dedicated to discovering therapeutic opportunities for people living with rare genetic diseases. This introduction led Rarebase to partner with the nonprofit organization Hope4Harper, which supports research for children affected by CDKL5 deficiency disorder.The disorder-characterized by seizures and developmental delays that begin in infancy-is now one of the rare genetic diseases in Rarebase's research portfolio. Rarebase, also located in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded to develop a more scalable approach to drug discovery for the medically underserved rare disease community. The lab currently employs seven researchers and two engineers, led by Chris Moxham, PhD, a drug hunter with expertise in clinical-stage drug development for rare diseases.Illumina, Monday, November 7, 2022, Press release picturePhoto: Rarebase Co-founder and COO Omid Karkouti with the Jogani family and Rarebase Director of Discovery Research Sabine Topka, PhD.Story continuesThe big-data revolution in biomedical research has enabled Rarebase to address the gap in rare disease drug discovery in a novel way: by studying thousands of rare genetic diseases within a single research platform, which Rarebase has named Function™. Using this data, the team can map precision medicine opportunities for individual diseases and assess the rare genetic disease space at large.Function identifies drug candidates that could target the root-cause biology of rare genetic diseases. By targeting these root causes, the company aims to ""rebalance dysregulated gene expression"" while addressing multiple symptoms for each disease-and ultimately to accelerate discoveries across the entire landscape of genetically defined rare diseases.""Using our Function research platform, we're looking for matches between the effects of approximately 2,700 FDA-approved drugs and the underlying biology of each disease,"" Faber says. To conduct the drug screens that inform Function, Rarebase researchers use the Illumina NovaSeq™ 6000 and NextSeq™ 2000 to perform gene-expression readouts. Next-generation RNA sequencing enables the Rarebase team to take a systems-level view of the underlying biology of each rare genetic disease, including CDKL5 deficiency disorder. They expect that this level of detail will refine drug predictions across the board. ""We're working to expand our data set to cover more therapeutic areas by performing screens in additional cell types and developing methods to extrapolate from our current data set.""About Reyna's condition, he explains: ""So far, we've identified several promising drug candidates that can alter CDKL5 gene expression. These candidates require additional evaluation, so the next step is to test these compounds in cell models that contain CDKL5 genetic variants.""Rarebase involves patients and families at every stage of their research. They partner with families like Reyna's so the patient community can identify therapeutic opportunities for their loved ones early on. To date, the Rarebase team has completed initial screening of nearly 4,000 compounds-more than half of which are FDA-approved-and identified preliminary drug-repurposing candidates for the 27 patient groups they're currently working with.Illumina, Monday, November 7, 2022, Press release picturePhoto: Jaime BorschukReyna is now four years old, and Jainu says that understanding her CDKL5 mutation helped them better approach precision medicine and their available options: ""We aspire big for our Reyna. People think we are crazy-but we want her to lead an independent life, go to school, college, start a family, and live the life she wants to. It is going to be challenging, but with medical advances, we don't think it is impossible.""Jainu and Shruti founded CDKL5 South Asia, an NGO focused on raising awareness in that region, where CDKL5 deficiency disorder is three times more likely than in the United States-but where genetic testing is less accessible. They're helping hospitals differentiate between it and Rett syndrome, a disorder with similar features; advocating pharma companies to conduct trials of potential therapeutic drugs; and working to counteract the stigma associated with such rare, debilitating conditions, so children can have the best quality of life.Jainu is also the chairperson of the CDKL5 Alliance, composed of groups in 35 countries that are working toward equity in treatment options for children with the disorder.Faber says that Rarebase has made significant progress in the two years since it was founded: ""By applying cutting-edge drug hunting technology at scale, we are changing the way that potential therapeutic candidates are discovered and developed for rare genetic diseases- and we are very excited about the future.""Learn more about how Illumina is expanding access to genomics, click here.Illumina, Monday, November 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724226/Rarebase-Is-on-the-Hunt-for-Therapeutic-Opportunities]"

It has amassed assets over $273.05 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.41%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 20.80% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Cigna Corp (CI) accounts for about 1.32% of total assets, followed by Mckesson Corp (MCK) and Centene Corp (CNC).The top 10 holdings account for about 12.37% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskCLRG seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ CHAIKIN POWER US LARGE CAP INDEX before fees and expenses. The NASDAQ Chaikin Power US Large Cap Index applies a quantitative multi-factor model that seeks to identify securities that are expected to outperform peers by selecting securities from the Nasdaq US 300 Index.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -14.35% so far this year and is down about -12.78% in the last one year (as of 11/08/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $28.38 and $36.15.The ETF has a beta of 1.04 and standard deviation of 25.38% for the trailing three-year period.

217,89c8ecf8-66fb-38b2-8437-392bd4b4493d,CI,2022-11-08,Is Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) Trading At A 41% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporation-nyse-ci-trading-110110759.html,1667905270,STORY,['CI'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.55bUS$10.6bUS$8.32bUS$8.67bUS$8.60bUS$8.60bUS$8.65bUS$8.73bUS$8.85bUS$8.98bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.86%Est @ -0.01%Est @ 0.59%Est @ 1%Est @ 1.3%Est @ 1.5% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$8.0kUS$9.3kUS$6.9kUS$6.7kUS$6.2kUS$5.8kUS$5.5kUS$5.2kUS$5.0kUS$4.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$63bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$197bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$197b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$103bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$167b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$324, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cigna as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.907. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Cigna, we've compiled three relevant aspects you should further research:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Cigna .Future Earnings: How does CI's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

You can skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and current market trends and go directly to see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back.In the third quarter of 2022, inflation pressures resulted in central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy. Nominal and real bond yields have been pushed to their highest levels in over a decade as a result, with the market being thrown into a downturn. According to a Fidelity Investments report published this year, profit growth has been decelerating while remaining positive, while expectations for earnings growth among S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at 10%.As a result of the inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, the country is thrown into a state of confusion. We aren't in a recession, yet major companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), among others, are thus seeing significant decreases in their stock prices. Many are trading at historically low levels, offering investors the opportunity to buy them while they are affordable.However, the S&amp;P 500 has begun its recovery. In October, the broader benchmark posted gains of 7.99% for the month. Technology stocks are getting hammered while energy and certain healthcare stocks are doing really well this year. Overall, the benchmark is still down 18.76% year-to-date. As a result, now is the best time to buy renowned companies at a discounted rate, to benefit from future profits.Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look BackImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMany investors believe that the stock market is efficient. We disagree. The 52-week price range for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is $108 and $346. That's an extremely wide range. Was NVDA efficiently priced when it was trading at $346? How about at $108? Did the future cash flows of NVDA go down by two thirds in a matter of 12 months? We believe the stock market gets overly pessimistic right before the market bottoms and that's usually a very good time to buy for long-term investors. Selling stocks when the earnings and the P/E multiples peak is also a good idea. We don't think we are near the bottom yet, but we are getting close. It is time to get prepared which is why we are going to take a look at the following 10 stocks that we can buy on sale and stay invested for the long-term.Story continuesOur Methodology:For our list below, we have selected stocks with significant long-term growth potential despite their share prices falling this year. We have considered current projects and operations the companies are involved in to determine whether they are truly on the path to growth in the long term. We have also looked at key fundamentals such as their revenue and free cash flow growth and guidance, alongside looking at analyst ratings and price targets. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back10. Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Share Price as of November 4: $81.93Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc.

It is based in Bethesda, Maryland.The company is down 50% from its recent highs, as of November 3. The company is currently trading for less than 10x its forward earnings. Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD) is however growing into a leader in commercial real estate finance. It sees more opportunities in the market this year, and has an operating revenue of $226 million, which is 24% higher than its $184 million operating revenue in the first quarter of 2021. While there is general pessimism in the commercial real estate market, Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD) is poised to remain unfazed and grow to unprecedented highs, making now the best time to buy the stock before it gets too expensive.MD Sass was the largest stakeholder in Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD) in the second quarter, holding 327,036 shares worth $31.5 million. In total, 16 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $100.3 million.Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD), like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), is among the best stocks to buy on the dip at present.9. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Share Price as of November 4: $13.26Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is an automobile manufacturer that services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles across the globe. The company operates through its Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments, and it is based in Dearborn, Michigan. It also offers wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory.An Overweight rating was reiterated on shares of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) by Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley on October 27.Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is trading exceptionally cheap right now, but the company shows room for share price growth based on strong fundamentals. The company raised its free cash flow guidance for 2022 this October, bringing it up to $9.5 billion - $10 billion, compared to the previous figures of $5.5 billion - $6.5 billion. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also saw a 10% year-over-year increase in its revenue in the third quarter.Out of 895 hedge funds tracked in the second quarter, 46 funds were long Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), with a total stake value of $608.8 million. In comparison, 46 funds were long the stock in the previous quarter as well, with a total stake value of $1.2 billion.Leaven Partners, an investment management firm, mentioned Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Share Price as of November 4: $84.68Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a consumer discretionary company operating as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee across the glove. The company operates through its North America, International, and Channel Development segments and offers coffee and tea beverages, roasted whole beans and ground coffee, single-serve products, and ready-to-drink beverages across its stores internationally. It is based in Seattle, Washington.Joshua Long at Stephens initiated coverage of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares on September 22 with an Equal Weight rating and a $91 price target.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a blue-chip stock you can buy today at a bargain since it has historically been undervalued by 16%, yet has the ability to deliver returns of almost 150% within the next five years. The company's management is guiding for 17%-22.5% CAGR long-term returns, and analysts also think 17% is likely. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) boosted its growth outlook by 2% annually in the long-term growth plan outlined in the company's 2022 investor day held this September. The company has also guided for 10%-12% annual sales growth.Bailard Inc was the largest stakeholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the second quarter, holding 71,319 shares worth $6 million. There were 55 hedge funds long the stock in total, with a total stake value of $1.4 billion.Polen Capital, an investment management firm, mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Share Price as of November 4: $90.40NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a footwear company that designs, develops, markets, and sells men's women's, and kids' athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories across the globe. The company provides its products under the Jumpman, Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron, and Jack Purcell trademarks. It is based in Beaverton, Oregon.Raymond James' Rick Patel initiated coverage of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares on October 13 with an Outperform rating and a $99 price target.While current market headwinds make most investors wary of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), the company's strong fundamentals cannot go ignored. It has managed to beat earnings estimates for the past four quarters consistently. In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, the company's EPS was $0.93, beating estimates by $0.01. Its revenue was $12.69 billion, up 3.58% year-over-year, and beating estimates by $399.97 million. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was also the biggest gainer in the Dow 30 stocks at the start of October, rising 3.25% and coming up to more than 12% in partial recovery. The company's robust fundamentals and persistence in maintaining earnings records can lead to its further growth in the coming years, especially as recession fears die down.NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was found among the 13F holdings of 72 hedge funds in the second quarter, and 67 funds in the previous quarter. Their total stake values were $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.RiverPark Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Share Price as of November 4: $134.21NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an information technology company providing graphics, and compute and networking solutions in the US, Taiwan, China, and internationally. The company is a key player in the semiconductor space, and is based in Santa Clara, California. Its products are used in the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets.A Buy rating was reiterated on shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) on October 25 by analyst Rajvindra Gill at Needham. The analyst also placed a $155 price target on the stock.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has shown strong forward guidance estimates for the next five years, showing that investing in the company now will be smart seeing as it is set to keep growing in the future. This October, the company's shares were down by 56% over the past year, meaning the time is perfect to buy the stock at a bargain. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a significant upside potential of 44%-45%.Catherine Wood's ARK Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter, holding 1.4 million shares worth $167.8 million. In total, 84 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $3.3 billion.Baron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), is a growth stock forecasted to continue beating the market in the coming years. As such, it is the best stock to buy while it's still affordable. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back. Suggested articles:11 Best Future Food Stocks To Buy11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest InDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$47.07, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Kleber Santos.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Wells Fargo Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$133m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Wells Fargo insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Wells Fargo has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Wells Fargo downgrading Costco, saying, while the stock remains a high quality name, it sees a number of hurdles going forward from here. I mean, I enjoy Costco, actually. I mean, we've talked about how the hot dog is inflation battling, if you will.BRIAN SOZZI: I get this call. It comes at an interesting time. They have some tough financial comparisons. And any time, as an analyst, you see those comparisons come, you think slowing sales, slowing earnings growth, and perhaps the stock comes in. Costco is down about 15% year to date. Surprisingly, they had a big last year. And let me look at the valuation. Currently, Costco shares trade at a PE ratio, a forward PE ratio of 33 times.Now, if you go onto Yahoo Finance, you pull up Target, it's trading at 13 times. You have Walmart trading at 22 times. So if you really are a believer in big box retail this holiday season, there are probably cheaper alternatives to go out there and analyze on your own than a Costco. Essentially, right now, Costco is priced for perfection. So even if they come out over the next couple of months and do have a bang up holiday season, perhaps it's not as much as the market would like to see.BRAD SMITH: One of the enigmatic machinations of the tab system on my computer is that I always have a Costco tab open somewhere. And this time, I happen to have their October sales results open. And particularly, something that does stick out to me is that e-commerce, over the past four weeks for their October sales results, was actually down by about 7/10 of a percent, versus the nine-week scale there. And also in the US, you're seeing some of the comp sales only up by about 9.2% in that four-week period.Now, particularly going into this holiday season, too, you're not just going to have people that are shopping for groceries at Costco, knowing that you're going to have more indoor gatherings. Know that people are going to be coming over, but you're also perhaps going to see some of the annexation of just the deal mindset permeate over into that shopping experience at Costco. That's at least what they would hope and anticipate for.Story continuesBut then, how does that also mean they're beefing up the amount of inventory that they have in order to meet some of that demand? And churning through that inventory, we already know, has proven to be a challenge for many retail companies, if not all of them, over the course of [INAUDIBLE].BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I have to check Costco, too. I'm starting to plan Thanksgiving dinner. I have found a location for Thanksgiving dinner. I want to see if Costco sells venison or deer meat because, apparently, it's the cheaper alternative this Thanksgiving season than turkey. Yeah, yeah.BRAD SMITH: Interesting.BRIAN SOZZI: Good articles floating out there. Deer meat.BRAD SMITH: Well, we'll find you a good butcher in Brooklyn.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: I'll hook you up.]"

This merger would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets, including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox has also entered a multi-year deal with VIZIO VZIO to expand its distribution partnership. The Fox Sports app will now be available on VIZIO smart TVs along with the Fox Weather channel being added to VIZIO WatchFree+ besides existing Fox ad-supported LiveNOW and Fox Soul. VIZIO Ads will also have access to Fox’s premium inventory for audience-based opportunities with advertisers.Story continuesIn August, Fox announced the completion of a multi-year renewal of its distribution agreement with Verizon for its Fios TV platform.The agreement included the continued distribution of the entire portfolio of FOX brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Network and local FOX O&amp;O TV stations in markets including New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. FOX Weather has also been added to the Fios TV lineup and Tubi is included in both Fios TV set-top boxes, as well as on many other platforms. Threats Attached to the DealsThese mergers and acquisitions and partnerships are expected to bolster Fox’s top line, but they also bring certain headwinds for the company.The wagering business, into which Fox is expanding, is highly competitive with companies like DraftKings DKNG having already established a secure market position in the sports betting industry.DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.The merger with News Corporation also brings some risks for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.This has not boded well among the investors.

Fox filed a claim in 2021 against Flutter last year, saying that the amount it should pay for the stake ought to be linked to the $11.2B value of FanDuel when Flutter last increased its holding in 2020.This would have implied a lower price tag for Fox's potential purchase.However, the arbitration tribunal found that the option should instead be based on a valuation of FanDuel of $20B with an annual compounding carrying value adjustment of 5%. When including this figure, that would mean that Fox would have to pay over $4B for the stake in FanDuel.Had the ruling been reversed, Flutter would have been forced to sell a stake at a sharply discounted rate. Fox now has until 2030 to make its purchase.""Today's ruling vindicates the confidence we had in our position on this matter and provides certainty on what it would cost FOX to buy into this business, should they wish to do so,"" said Flutter chief executive officer Peter Jackson in a statement.Analysts at Morgan Stanley called the arbitration outcome a ""net positive"" for Flutter, adding that it adds clarity to the future shape and ownership of FanDuel. The analysts also lifted their price target for Flutter to 16.000p from 15.800p.Fox claimed its own victory following the ruling, pointing in particular to the 10-year option it has to buy a stake in a ""market leading"" operation. The media conglomerate said that this purchase will allow it to harness a recent surge in the value of gambling firms.Story continuesRelated ArticlesFlutter Shares Rise After Ruling Ends Legal Battle with Fox Over FanDuel StakeSaudi Arabia stocks higher at close of trade; Tadawul All Share up 0.67%Palantir Slips After Earnings Despite Raised Profit Forecast, Citi Sees More Downside]"

238,792a8ab4-b2ad-3ccc-971d-6014ea32d295,IBM,2022-11-08,"Death, dying, and digital transformation",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/death-dying-digital-transformation-190000549.html,1667847600,STORY,['IBM'],"[Comparing the human grieving process to what organizations go through when trying to digitally transform might sound like a stretch. And yet, while working with 200 or so large organizations over the past decade, I began to notice a pattern: strong parallels between Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s classic book, On Death and Dying, and the journey organizations undergo while attempting to digitally transform.Kübler-Ross describes the grieving process in five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Those stages, it turns out, are uncomfortably close to what many CEOs and their teams have experienced. We can view the five stages of digital transformation in overlapping chronological order, with the aim of learning from the efforts of others.Denial: Cognitive computingBy the 2010s, the digitalization of manual corporate systems was nearly complete, coinciding with over half of Western households owning a personal computer and setting the stage for the next revolution—digital transformation, or DX. The age of “cognitive computing” had arrived.In 2011, when IBM Watson famously won Jeopardy!, the DX hype curve skyrocketed. IBM positioned Watson as artificial intelligence so powerful it could diagnose cancer better than any physician. Enterprises turned to vendors like IBM and GE, which had launched GE Predix to make a “digital twin” of anything, to bring them into the digital age.The result? High-profile IBM Watson projects at organizations like Memorial Sloan Kettering failed, and IBM ended up selling IBM Watson Health to a private equity firm for pennies on the dollar. But not before Watson’s blunders contributed to then-CEO Ginni Rometty’s departure. As for GE Predix: Its well-documented failure coincided with the departure of Jeff Immelt.Organizations transitioned out of these embarrassing failures from a state of denial—a sense that “this can’t be happening to us”—to outright anger.Anger: Digital strategyHuge IT losses spurred business leaders to take over from the IT side, hiring expensive consultants, and ushering in the era of “digital strategy.”Story continuesThis stage led to the proliferation of the “proof of concept” (POC) taking root in each business unit. Few POCs succeeded—and none could scale. When CEOs describe this stage of their journey to me, they blame a general lack of focus, little coordination across business units, disparate technologies, tense “alignment” meetings, and exasperated realization of little business value.Bargaining: The data lakeIn the Kübler-Ross model, after denial and anger comes bargaining. When costly strategic shifts failed to deliver, data took the blame. “Garbage in, garbage out” was the popular saying. This led to the next shimmering mirage: the “data lake.”The idea of the data lake is to create a unified, federated image of the entire enterprise, bringing all the data into a single, organized, integrated repository. Such efforts date back to the disastrous “data warehouse” efforts of the 1990s.I’m unaware of any successful effort to create a single, comprehensive enterprise data lake. It turns out that for a large organization—with hundreds of sources and types of data—the problem is simply intractable. Organizations have wasted years and untold millions on these efforts.Depression: The cloudThis led to sadness and regret, which reached the board level. These data lake blunders cost many CIOs, and even some CEOs, their jobs. At this point, organizations raised their hopes for salvation to the cloud.Many companies remain stalled in the “cloud” stage. Today’s tech landscape is awash with new cloud technologies and services that aim to transform by moving data and applications from inside the enterprise to data centers residing elsewhere, and then stringing everything together via APIs. Most organizations are experimenting with a variety of cloud technologies and services but realizing little value.Elastic cloud computing is tremendously valuable, and the hyperscale cloud services—Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services—are essential. Cloud computing alone, however, does not drive digital transformation. I’ve seen many skilled executives champion the migration of their IT operations and systems to the cloud, only to be left cobbling together applications from a depressing, ever-changing cluster of unintegrated products and services.Acceptance: Digital transformationTrue digital transformation only happens when organizations reach clarity—yes, acceptance—on what digital transformation is about. Rather than flashy new programs, it requires focus on tractable problems that, when solved, deliver measurable value, and methodically applying this approach across the enterprise.To be sure, some organizations are achieving true digital transformation. Both Shell and the United States Air Force’s Rapid Sustainment Office are standout examples. Each is taking a focused approach on solving high-value problems and then replicating that success in a systematic way.Is it possible to short-circuit the five stages?I’m not sure it is. Most organizations I know go through some form of the five stages. Until the organization has lived through these experiences, little progress is made.If you understand where your enterprise sits on its digital journey, you will be better positioned to accelerate your progress toward real digital transformation, perhaps even bypassing a painful Kübler-Ross–like stage or two.Thomas M. Siebel is the chairman and CEO of C3 AI. Previously, he founded Siebel Systems, serving as its CEO and chairman from 1993 until its acquisition by Oracle in 2006. He’s also the author of Digital Transformation: Survive and Thrive in an Era of Mass Extinction.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraElon Musk is facing trial again over his $56 billion Tesla paycheck that’s ‘the largest in human history’The winners of the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot will probably take it in cash.

239,137993c5-c079-30d8-a06b-d1ec18dd79e3,IBM,2022-11-08,Here is What to Know Beyond Why International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-international-business-140002810.html,1667829602,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +15.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. This estimate has changed -2.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of +6.2% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7.2%. The $59.32 billion and $59.89 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -16.2% and +1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

240,b300c962-3c2b-3e74-9443-62e82d518c37,IBM,2022-11-08,IBM: ‘America must invest in a new model of innovation–and it’s not just in Silicon Valley’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-america-must-invest-model-123700897.html,1667824620,STORY,['IBM'],"[When President Biden visited IBM’s Poughkeepsie, New York campus on Oct. 6, he concluded his speech with a prediction: “More is going to change for the better in the next 10 years than happened in the last 40 years… [and] the changes that are going to take place in the next 10 are going to fundamentally alter the way in which we look at the world.”The President is right–particularly about the changes we’re seeing in the technology sector.For about forty years, the American technology sector has been synonymous with Silicon Valley. Even tech’s other hubs–places like Boston and Austin–have economies that largely resemble the Bay Area’s, with most innovation happening in front of a keyboard and monitor; engineers developing the apps, programs, and platforms that occupy our digital lives.This is an important model of innovation. But we need to remember that the future of America’s tech sector will be built on both the software and the hardware it runs on, a model where innovation is undertaken by researchers at labs and workers in manufacturing facilities–not just programmers in office buildings.Put another way, the future of the American tech sector will look as much like the Hudson Valley as it does Silicon Valley. In many ways, it already does.The swath of land that extends up the Hudson River from Westchester County to Albany is the original capital of America’s computing industry. From the 1960s to the ‘90s, it’s where IBM developed and manufactured the hardware advances that were foundational to the software breakthroughs that came later. Our modern computing and business environments wouldn’t exist without the mainframe.The ecosystem that created these products is still here. It’s not just because of companies like IBM, but also thanks to the talent coming from the vibrant university ecosystem that is present in the State of New York, from SUNY, Marist College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic, to Columbia, Cornell, and beyond. It is also the result of a state government that’s willing to support the development and manufacturing of these products.Story continuesToday, America is realizing that we need to invest in this kind of tech hubs again–especially after the recent chip shortage.America invented the semiconductor and its associated industry, but on the eve of the pandemic, our country only manufactured 12% of the world's chips, and none of its most advanced. We paid a price for that. There was a pandemic-induced supply crunch on everything from cars to smartphones, which caused an unfortunate spike in prices. The country is recovering now, but the data show our semiconductor shortage reduced economic output by a full percentage point.And America doesn’t just need to manufacture more chips–it needs to accelerate the field of computing. More sophisticated artificial intelligence, for example, requires increasingly advanced chips: faster, yet smaller; more powerful, yet more energy efficient. Other problems–like finding the precisely correct chemical structure for advanced materials–have pushed traditional computing methods to the limit. Solving them will require an entirely new approach, which will be made possible by the very type of quantum computers that IBM is pioneering in the Hudson Valley.This was the rationale behind the historic and bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Biden signed in August. The idea–which was championed by leaders from both parties like Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Senator Todd Young (R-IN)–was to use public funds to both reverse the erosion of U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors and catalyze tens of billions of dollars in private investment. The money would spur the development of new chip-making hubs, drive research and development into advanced computing, and spur regional economic development.If there was any equivocation that the CHIPS strategy would work, what happened during the last month in New York should put it to rest.IBM announced $20 billion to support our work in the Hudson Valley, which includes developing many future generations of mainframes, quantum computers, and advanced semiconductors. This comes on the heels of the chip manufacturer Micron committing $100 billion over the next two decades to develop a giant semiconductor factory in Clay, New York–140 miles west of Malta, New York, where another chip manufacturer, GlobalFoundries, had already announced an expansion.These investments will create local economies that look very different from your traditional tech hubs because they’ll benefit a much broader array of people–not just computer engineers, but factory and lab workers.Since the 1970s, the lion’s share of America’s capital and talent has flowed to a few superstar cities, creating what some economists have termed “durable islands of wealth and poverty.” The Hudson Valley model can help unwind this economic phenomenon because it brings so many more of us along. As President Biden relayed to the media after meeting Poughkeepsie IBMers, “You do not need an advanced degree… to be making $120,000 a year.”This, of course, will be a decades-long project. Among other things, it will require the smart implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act. Having New York play a key role in the National Semiconductor Technology Center, for example, would supercharge the state’s ongoing economic and workforce development and greatly augment U.S. competitiveness.In the years ahead, while Congress and the Biden Administration will certainly not agree on everything, expanding the geography of innovation in our country is one of the most important endeavors we need to pursue. The Hudson Valley, which is reinventing itself as the home to the future of computing, is an inspiring model for what is possible when government, industry, and academia join forces around a unified vision. The task ahead is monumental, but we will get it done–and it’s an effort all parties should get behind.Darío Gil is the SVP and director of IBM Research.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:Elon Musk knows what he’s doing.

241,23a6f070-a772-302c-aa16-621facc54f6c,MPC,2022-11-08,3 Oil & Energy Stocks Still Poised for Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oil-energy-stocks-still-172005383.html,1667841605,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', 'LNG', 'HAL', 'MPC']","[Oil and Energy stocks have continued to be a safe haven for investors this year and have consistently outperformed the broader market. Investors may once again be wondering if it’s time to take profits or if there is still more upside in the Oil and Energy sector.Let’s take a look at three highly ranked Zacks stocks in the sector that still look poised for growth.Cheniere Energy LNG Cheniere Energy is an energy infrastructure business engaged in Liquefied Natural Gas distribution and marketing. Cheniere Energy is one of the only listed LNG export pure plays in the U.S.Cheniere Energy earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimates on the rise. LNG earnings are expected to climb 205% this year and soar another 102% in FY23 to $19.68 per share. Sales are set to jump 100% this year but decline -18% in FY23 to $26.14 billion. Despite the slowing top line growth next year the company appears poised to excel by keeping operating costs low and revenue is expected to stay high following an excellent year. Year to date LNG is up a stellar +68% to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -22%. This has also outperformed the Oil &amp; Gas U.S. Exploration Production Market’s +54%. Even better, over the last decade, LNG is up +1,081% to blast the benchmark and its Zacks Subindustry’s +12%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLNG currently trades around $170 a share and recently hit 52-week highs after blasting earnings expectations last week by 43% at $7.80 per share. At current levels, LNG has a forward P/E of 17.6X. Despite the impressive run over the last year, this is well below its decade-high of 1,259.5X and the median of 24.4X.LNG has a unique niche and offers investors a modest 0.77% dividend yield at $1.32 per share. The Average Zacks Price Targets also suggest 16% upside from current levels.Halliburton HAL Halliburton is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world and sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Haliburton offers equipment, maintenance, engineering, and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors.Story continuesHAL is up +71% YTD to outperform the S&amp;P 500 and its peer group’s +44% with notable competitors Baker Hughes BKR and Schlumberger SLB. Halliburton is becoming a leader in its industry with a strong performance over the last three years, up +84% to crush the benchmark and its peer group’s +59%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHalliburton stock is 10% off its 52-week highs, trading around $39 a share. HAL has a forward P/E of 18.5X. This is nicely below the industry average of 25.3X and well below its decade-high of 266X.According to Zacks estimates, HAL earnings are expected to jump 92% at $2.08 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to climb another 40%. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to rise 33% this year and another 16% in FY23 to $23.63 billion.Halliburton’s Oil and Gas–Field Services is in the top 8% of over 250 Zacks Industries and the Average Zacks Price Target offers 15% upside from current levels. HAL also offers a respectable 1.25% dividend yield at $0.48 per share.Marathon Petroleum MPC As a leading independent refiner, transporter, and marketer of petroleum products Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is expected to have continued growth. The company operates in two segments, Pipeline Transportation and Refining and Marketing which includes 16 refineries in the west coast, gulf coast, and mid-continent regions of the U.S. MPC is up +87% in 2022, with rising estimate revisions still making the stock worth a look. Trading around $119 per share, MPC has a P/E of 4.9X. This is on par with the industry average and from the nearby chart, we can see that MPC trades well below its high of 41.4X earlier in the year and the median of 10.2X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMPC recently hit 52-week highs last week after beating Q3 estimates by 15% at $7.81 per share. Marathon Petroleum’s earnings are now expected to climb an impressive 879% to $23.99 based on Zacks estimates. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to decline -43% following a tough to compete with year. However, earnings estimates for this year and FY23 continue to rise and have gone up over the last week after the company’s strong earnings report.MPC currently lands a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and its Oil and Gas-Refining and Marketing Industry is in the top 2%. MPC offers investors a 1.97% dividend yield at $2.32 per share and the Average Zacks Price Target still suggests 7% upside from current levels.Bottom LineAlthough Oil and Energy stocks have enjoyed impressive rallies throughout the year many stocks in the sector are still poised for growth. The sector is one of the few areas of the economy expected to see growth in FY23 and may continue to be a safe haven for investors amid an economic downturn with crude oil prices still near $90 a barrel and natural gas exportation still in high demand.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

242,690a6506-79b0-3e06-925a-ff58ac0cfe82,MPC,2022-11-08,Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-mpc-attracting-140002721.html,1667829602,STORY,['MPC'],"[Marathon Petroleum (MPC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this refiner have returned +10.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Marathon Petroleum belongs, has gained 10.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $5.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +353.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +20.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.99 points to a change of +879.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +9.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.71 indicates a change of -42.9% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marathon Petroleum is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.19 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $171.37 billion and $134.81 billion estimates indicate +41.7% and -21.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.8%. EPS of $7.81 for the same period compares with $0.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.43%. The EPS surprise was +14.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Auto Stocks To Buy Now. The automotive sector is one of the most rate-sensitive segments of the economy, and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish moves this year have left a mark on the industry in terms of higher borrowing costs for both auto suppliers and original original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Research and development investments, as well as other capital expenditures are now more expensive. This will cut into auto margins, which were running high after the pandemic eased and pent-up consumer demand hit the markets. However, prices of automobiles are also rising simultaneously, especially as the industry shifts towards electrification of vehicles. According to McKinsey, the automotive revenues will meaningfully increase as the market transitions towards on-demand mobility and data-driven services. This could add up to $1.5 trillion in additional revenue by 2030, compared to roughly $5.2 trillion from conventional car sales and aftermarket products/services. Although global car sales will continue to grow, the annual growth rate is forecasted to decline from 3.6% over the last five years to approximately 2% by 2030. This drop will be primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and the rise of latest mobility trends such as carpooling and e-hailing. However, emerging trends will continue to surprise the auto sector, and some of the best stocks to pick up in the space include Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). Our Methodology We selected the following auto stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and robust dividend profiles. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. 10 Best Auto Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Lenny Kuhne on UnsplashStory continuesBest Auto Stocks To Buy Now10.

250,1e0268d9-c758-3d6a-8099-3b5598b776c9,UAL,2022-11-08,United (UAL) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-ual-incredible-growth-stock-174505221.html,1667843105,STORY,['UAL'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends United Airlines (UAL) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this airline a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for United is 23.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 111.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 67.4%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, United has an S/TA ratio of 0.59, which means that the company gets $0.59 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.58, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And United is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 81.7% this year versus the industry average of 16.6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for United. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 265.5% over the past month.Bottom LineUnited has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions United well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.United Airlines (UAL) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 25.9% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this airline well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 8.3% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for UAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.35. This indicates that the stock moves 35% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that UAL has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UAL earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UAL is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UAL is currently trading at 0.34 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 34 cents for each dollar of sales.So, UAL appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to UAL, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

(NYSE:PNC) stock at an average sell price of US$187 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. The company's market valuation decreased by US$2.7b after the stock price dropped 3.9% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$183 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$157). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At PNC Financial Services Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. In total, Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking Michael Lyons sold US$584k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$220m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PNC Financial Services Group Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since PNC Financial Services Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for PNC Financial Services Group and we suggest you have a look.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The same for earnings per share is pegged at $1.40, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 13.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings has moved down 1% in the past 30 days.Q3 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, WestRock delivered year-over-year improvement in both adjusted earnings per share and revenues. While revenues came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, earnings beat the same. WRK’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 7.4%, on average.WestRock Company Price and EPS SurpriseWestRock Company Price and EPS SurpriseWestRock Company price-eps-surprise | WestRock Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteWestRock has been witnessing solid demand for its products and solutions in key end markets for the past few quarters. It has been focused on partnering with customers to fulfill their growing demand for sustainable, fiber-based packaging solutions. E-commerce demand remains strong across all channels, primarily during the pandemic. These factors are likely to have driven fiscal fourth-quarter performance.Solid demand for corrugated packaging, containerboard, food and beverage consumer packaging and industrial packaging might have contributed to growth. However, demand might have been impacted in some of its markets owing to weak customer spending.Labor shortages and supply-chain issues have been disrupting production and impacting shipments to customers.  Higher Old Corrugated Containers (OCC) costs as well as elevated energy, freight and chemicals costs as well as planned maintenance downtime are likely to hurt margins in the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continuesIn the fiscal third quarter of 2022, WestRock implemented a series of additional paperboard price increases in the range of $50 to $100 per ton, which are expected to have offset some of these headwinds.WestRock acquired KapStone Paper and Packaging Corp in 2019, with the integration on track. The buyout helped the company cement its presence in the Western United States. The company continues to boost its North American corrugated packaging business margins.These moves are likely to have contributed to its performance in the quarter under review.  Productivity, price increase actions, performance-improvement programs across its manufacturing footprint and cost savings may have favored the company’s fiscal third-quarter performance.Also, the company shut down operations at its containerboard and pulp mill located in Panama City, FL, in the quarter to be reported. WRK is expected to have recorded expenses associated with the closure, which may have impacted margins.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for WestRock this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that is not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for WestRock is -0.24%.Zacks Rank: WestRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Share Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWestRock’s shares have lost 14.8% over the past three months, compared with the industry’s decline of 6.5%.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some stocks, which, according to, our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Perpetua Resources PPTA, expected to release earnings on Nov 11, has an Earnings ESP of +50% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Recently, ROST's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.A golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, another technical event that indicates bearish price movement may be on the horizon.Over the past four weeks, ROST has gained 8.1%.

Well, let's just say at least they had fun!The Lakeshore Foundation, located in Birmingham, Alabama, is an internationally renowned organization. According to Amy Belcher, volunteer coordinator, the foundation serves more than 4,000 individuals annually through physical activity, sport, recreation, advocacy, policy and research.""We also serve as an Olympic and Paralympic training site, strengthening the ongoing commitment to the development of para sports,"" Belcher said.The game between the bank's Finance department and Lakeshore was organized by Jacob Couch, who works in Tax Compliance at Regions, and coached by Maggie Elliot, from Regions Investor Relations. Couch has a special relationship with the Lakeshore Foundation, having served as a volunteer for more than six years, assisting with events such as men's and women's wheelchair basketball tournaments, wheelchair rugby events, wheelchair football, track and field, and power soccer.""I knew that Lakeshore Foundation had just begun practices for their 2022-2023 National Wheelchair Basketball Association season, and they were looking for groups to help them prepare,"" Couch said. ""And I knew just the team who could help them out.""Couch helped organize a group within his work area called Finance Associates Serving Together, or F.A.S.T. Regions had just celebrated their annual Evergreen Week, in which associates celebrate each other and their communities, and the F.A.S.T. members were looking for a volunteer activity to do together. Couch recalled that October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month, and all the pieces starting coming together - on the basketball court.Regions Chief Financial Officer David Turner was one of the first to volunteer, though he had no experience with wheelchair basketball. ""Community service is part of Regions' mission to create shared value,"" Turner said. ""And the Lakeshore Foundation is a great community partner of ours - with not only financial support but also volunteerism.""Story continuesBelcher commented on the important contributions of the team and the entire bank. ""Without the support of corporations like Regions, the important work of Lakeshore would be impossible,"" she said. ""The willingness of this group to learn more about adaptive sport and the importance of inclusivity extends the reach of Lakeshore's work into the community.""Turner, who played collegiate baseball at the University of Alabama, appreciates good competition and praised both teams for their effort.""There was a good five-to-six-minute span in the third period where everything seemed to be coming together - good defense, good chair movement, and good ball movement on offense with lots of made baskets,"" Turner said. ""It was really fun and I was proud of the Regions team's commitment and dedication, while facing some incredibly talented athletes from Lakeshore. Those players are so inspiring.""The game is played with a traditional 10-foot goal and since participants are seated, they rely completely on upper body and core strength to pass and shoot - all while maneuvering the wheelchair up and down the court.""With 99 percent of the Regions team being unfamiliar with wheelchair basketball, they did a great job on defense all night,"" Couch said. ""No one had any quit in them, but they did come away with a few blisters!""The competition and fun are motivating, but Couch's connection to the Lakeshore Foundation goes beyond sports. ""As an army brat I wasn't able to build lifelong friendships growing up,"" he said. ""But when I volunteered at my first Lakeshore event, I felt an instant sense of belonging.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the finance sector and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Dividend Stocks to Invest In. The finance sector in the US involves all companies that specialize in banking, insurance, financial services, mortgages, credit cards, and other payment services. The sector is one of the most important industries in the country, contributing significantly to its GDP. According to a report published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the US has the world’s largest capital markets, representing 41% of global equity. The country’s markets also fund 72% of its domestic economic activity. The report also mentioned that the US has over $760 billion worth of foreign investment in its financial sector, which is currently providing resources for a wide range of businesses.Over the years, the finance sector globally has evolved a lot due to the induction of digital channels, which has significantly contributed to the sector’s returns and growth. According to a report by IBISWorld, the finance and insurance sector in the US is currently valued at over $5.7 trillion and has grown 2.5% per year on average in the last five years. The implementation of digital channels has further resulted in the industry’s impressive growth. Bloomberg cited Data Bridge Market Research’s new report, which highlighted that the digital insurance platform market will grow at a CAGR of 13.7% from 2022 to 2029. The growth will be attributed to the rising use of IoT products and cloud-based digital solutions.Economists around the world are of the view that inflation is expected to last well into next year as well. They recommend investors load up on safe stocks that have the ability to generate stable income in current times. The S&amp;P 500 Financial index is down 13.3% year-to-date, versus a 21.3% decline in the broader market. According to Hartford Funds, financials have performed better during past inflationary pressures because of their stable cash flows. Moreover, strong cash flows signal solid dividends which are comforting in times of financial turmoil.Story continuesSome investors are considering long-term bonds that yield more than 4%. We believe these are ok investments but don't provide any upside potential. Some financial stocks declined by more than 30% in anticipation of a US recession and offer attractive yields. We expect these stocks to deliver large capital gains as well after the stock market hits its bottom. Bearing this in mind, we will discuss some of the best financial dividend stocks to invest in. Some of the popular dividend stocks in the sector include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).Best Financial Dividend Stocks to BuyInvestments, FinanceOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that belong to different segments within the finance industry, such as insurance, financial services, credit card services, and banking. We carefully analyzed their dividend policies and financial health. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields, as recorded on November 4.12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks to Invest In12. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 0.62%Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American financial service and payment processing company. It offers a wide range of related services to its consumers around the globe. In Q3 2022, the company reported revenue of $5.8 billion, which showed a 15.5% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, it repurchased shares worth over $1.6 billion and paid $474 million in dividends, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.49 per share. The company holds an eight-year track record of consistent dividend growth. As of November 4, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.62%.In November, Mizuho maintained a Buy rating on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) with a $380 price target, following the company's recent quarterly earnings. The firm also raised its FY22 estimates for the company.At the end of Q2 2022, 137 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database had investments in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), compared with 136 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a collective value of roughly $15 billion. Among these hedge funds, Akre Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q2.In addition to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), analysts and investors are also paying attention to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in the finance sector.Baron Funds mentioned Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Fund’s holdings in the Payments and Information Services themes also contributed to relative performance. Within Payments, lower exposure to this lagging theme and outperformance of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) added the most value. These global payment networks are viewed as safe havens during market downturns but are also benefiting from resilient payment volumes and a sharp rebound in international travel.”11. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 0.91%Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based financial services company that specializes in credit cards, debit cards, and payment cards. In October, BMO Capital maintained an Outperform rating on the stock with a $241 price target. The firm presented a positive outlook on the stock as a core portfolio holding.In fiscal Q4 2022, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported revenue of $7.8 billion, which showed a 19% growth from the same period last year. The company's cash generation remained strong during the quarter as it paid $14.8 billion to shareholders in dividends. Moreover, it also repurchased $2.9 billion worth of its shares.On October 25, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced a 20% growth in its quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. This marked the company's 14th consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. As of November 4, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.91%.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) was a popular stock among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 166 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, compared with 159 in the previous quarter. These stakes hold a collective value of over $24 billion.Wedgewood Partners mentioned Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) continues to report strong double-digit growth in payment volumes throughout the first two months of the calendar third quarter. The stock suffered after concerns about potential adverse legislation related to its credit card routing practices began to surface. Similar legislation related to the Company’s debit routing practices was passed into law back in 2010. Not unlike the previous legislation, the Company’s value proposition to merchants, consumers and bank-issuing customers and acquirers is robust enough to help blunt the potential effects the legislation might have in the near term. Over a multiyear time horizon, it would be quite difficult for any currently non-existent or even sub-scale credit routing network to add the value that Visa (or MasterCard) can already add today.”10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 1.07%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics. In Q3 2022, the company reported revenue of $2.86 billion, which showed a 36.8% growth from the same period last year. Through the third quarter of this year, it returned $11.7 billion to shareholders, including $749 million in cash dividends. In the first nine months, the company generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow.S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share. The company is one of the best dividend stocks to buy as it has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 49 years. As of November 4, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.07%.In October, Jefferies initiated its coverage on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) with a Buy rating and a $397 price target, highlighting the company's revenue and its Rating business.As of the close of Q2 2022, 84 hedge funds owned stakes in S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), down from 97 in the previous quarter. These stakes hold a collective value of over $7.2 billion.Baron Funds mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 1.44%American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based credit card service company that also offers a wide range of other financial services.

Its interest rate trading business had been depressed coming out of the recession, but with a tightening policy environment, it now provides upside optionality that augments robust free cash flow growth and capital return. Willscot Mobile Mini is another compounder that executed well through the pandemic but was not initially recognized for the synergies of its Mobile Mini acquisition. The deal has reduced costs and created greater operating leverage as the company rides the tailwinds of improving industrial production and construction.”6.

(NYSE:JPM), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).At the end of Q2 2022, 99 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), the same as in the previous quarter.

This merger would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets, including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox has also entered a multi-year deal with VIZIO VZIO to expand its distribution partnership. The Fox Sports app will now be available on VIZIO smart TVs along with the Fox Weather channel being added to VIZIO WatchFree+ besides existing Fox ad-supported LiveNOW and Fox Soul. VIZIO Ads will also have access to Fox’s premium inventory for audience-based opportunities with advertisers.Story continuesIn August, Fox announced the completion of a multi-year renewal of its distribution agreement with Verizon for its Fios TV platform.The agreement included the continued distribution of the entire portfolio of FOX brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Network and local FOX O&amp;O TV stations in markets including New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. FOX Weather has also been added to the Fios TV lineup and Tubi is included in both Fios TV set-top boxes, as well as on many other platforms. Threats Attached to the DealsThese mergers and acquisitions and partnerships are expected to bolster Fox’s top line, but they also bring certain headwinds for the company.The wagering business, into which Fox is expanding, is highly competitive with companies like DraftKings DKNG having already established a secure market position in the sports betting industry.DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.The merger with News Corporation also brings some risks for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.This has not boded well among the investors.

Teams of Verizon engineers, completing recovery work from Hurricane Ian, are already deployed throughout the sunshine state. They have completed maintenance and upgrades on assets that were used extensively throughout the past two months, and have supplemented that fleet of equipment with other mobile assets from other parts of the country. Mobile equipment has been pre-staged, fueling teams are on standby and operations teams have completed pre-incident preparations. Verizon Frontline and the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team also stand ready to provide first responders on the front lines of response efforts with the mission-critical communications support they need.“We are here for Florida,” said Kyle Malady, EVP and President, Global Networks and Technology. “We know the community is still reeling from Hurricane Ian and the threat of more critical weather is not the news anyone wants to hear. But Verizon will be here for Florida through this storm season and through the recovery time to come.   We are absolutely committed to providing Floridians the reliability and advanced technology they have come to expect from Verizon before, during and after the storms.”Verizon’s networks are prepared to keep people connectedRecognized repeatedly for reliability, Verizon’s extreme network is designed to withstand extreme weather and delivers superior service by including redundancy on critical paths and components to avoid a potential failure of a network component significantly affecting customers. The use of battery and generator backup systems in critical locations such as macro cell sites, switch locations and network operations centers also serves to minimize the risk of disruption if commercial power is lost. 100% of Verizon macro cell sites have backup battery power and 78% have backup generators nationally, and that number is higher in hurricane-prone areas like Florida. Verizon engineers have been preparing for the coming storm by ensuring fuel levels are high on all generators at cell sites, testing battery back-ups at network facilities, positioning extra equipment in case additional capacity is needed, and prepping emergency crews to respond quickly to any network issue. These are just a few of the reasons Verizon’s network is the network America relies on, in good times and bad.Story continuesIn case emergency network recovery becomes necessary after the storm makes landfall, Verizon is prepared to respond quickly. Verizon maintains a fleet of over 500 portable assets, including fully functional, generator-powered cells sites that can replace or enhance network coverage and capacity in a given area as well as drones and a fixed wing aircraft that can provide service from the sky above. Additionally, Verizon boasts an industry-leading 150 satellite based portable network assets that can be used in case fiber connection is lost due to loss of commercial power or physical damage. Those assets include mid-Earth orbit and geosynchronous assets. All of those mobile assets are complemented by nearly a thousand portable generators and a comprehensive refueling program.Are you ready for the storm? Verizon’s retail team stands ready to assist customers and ensure they have the right devices, accessories and connectivity they’ll need to weather the storm. And convenient options like locker, curbside and in store pickup provide quick ways to get what customers need and get out.In addition to the right tech, customers will want to take steps to ensure their families are prepared for the season as well. When a storm is forecast:Keep devices dry: While many phones today are some degree of water resistant, extra care could be needed to ensure phones, tablets, batteries, chargers and other equipment remain dry and accessible. Plastic zipper storage bags help shield devices, and there are weatherproof phones, phone cases and other protective accessories available.Keep devices fully charged: Make sure devices are ready by keeping phone and tablet batteries fully charged in case commercial power goes out.Get some backup: When power is out for an extended period of time, portable battery packs can be a game-changer to remain connected. Don’t forget car chargers as well in case evacuation is necessary.Create a list: Store emergency numbers in phones for easy access if needed.Be prepared for loss: Take pictures of valuables and other important belongings for possible insurance claims. And make sure they’re uploaded to the cloud as a backup.Review checklists: Review the hurricane preparedness checklist, power outage checklist and other resources from the American Red Cross.Download useful apps: There are plenty of free weather, news, and safety-related apps available for download.Business continuity is criticalThe need for a secure, stable connection for business continuity is never more apparent than during severe weather events and other emergencies. This is especially important with today’s increasingly common hybrid-work environments, in which highly distributed and mobile workforces are reliant on remote collaboration and digital networking tools to do business across wide and local areas simultaneously.The Verizon Business portfolio of solutions provides continuity of service for customers, from SD-WAN, to advanced security tools, to cloud and edge applications and the BlueJeans by Verizon video collaboration platform, fleet management and tracking through Verizon Connect, fixed-wireless Internet for primary or backup connectivity. Verizon’s network-as-a-service strategy gives customers the flexibility to scale services as they require so that they’re ready for anything.As businesses launch their in-office and at-home hybrid operations, now is a great time to assess readiness plans ahead of storm season. Suggested steps for businesses and government organizations include:Make sure contact information for all employees is updated and readily available, including at-home information for remote workers and branch information for satellite offices.Stress-test primary and backup networks and shore up any weak areasMake copies of insurance documents, review insurance coverages and update as appropriate.Ensure employees working from home have documented all corporate equipment being used to work from home in case of damage or loss.Ensure backup plans are in place to shift work in case work-from-home employees in a storm-impacted area have to evacuate their home or their home loses commercial power.Verizon Frontline is ready to support first responders The Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team stands ready to deploy in support of public safety agencies nationwide — at no cost to the agency —  to ensure they have the mission-critical communications support  they need when responding to severe weather and other crisis events. In 2021, the team deployed 84 times, to 13 states, in support of first responders on the front lines of hurricane response efforts.Composed of former first responders and military veterans, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to public safety agencies and emergency responders. The team is available 24/7 to deliver Verizon Frontline technologies including portable cell sites, drones, charging stations, WiFi hotspots, and other Verizon Frontline devices and solutions that enable communications and/or boost network performance.Verizon Frontline is the advanced network and technology built for first responders – developed over nearly three decades of partnership with public safety officials and agencies on the front lines – to meet their unique and evolving needs.After an emergency, call before you digDebris clean up and property repair are important tasks after a storm. Before beginning to clean up and make repairs, call 811 or visit call811.com to determine where fiber or other cables are buried. Contacting 811 before any digging project, large or small, is the easiest step toward reducing the chance of damaging underground fiber and keeping customers and first responders connected in critical moments. Fiber is the invisible footprint that moves data throughout Verizon’s network across the country and around the world. Verizon owns and operates over 1 million miles of fiber; that’s enough to wrap around Earth 40 times. Cutting those cables when digging can result in customers losing service and data connections being lost. So before storm clean up begins, call 811.**Editor’s Note:  To access images and b-roll of past storms, Verizon equipment, recovery efforts and more, please visit Verizon’s Emergency Resource Hub at https://www.verizon.com/about/news/emergency-resource-center Media contact: Karen Schulz864.561.1527Karen.Schulz@verizon.comAndrew Testa973.224.2081Andrew.Testa@Verizon.com]"

Aimco benefits from a strong balance sheet with limited near-term maturities, abundant liquidity and fully funded development commitments. We proactively monetized more than $900 million of assets during 2022, while also substantially adding to our high-quality development pipeline and opportunistically acquiring over one million shares of Aimco common stock.""Our active developments and redevelopment projects remain on track. At The Hamilton, Aimco's major redevelopment in Miami, we welcomed residents to their new homes in October and are experiencing healthy demand for this unique waterfront property. The building is 35% leased at rental rates ahead of our original expectations.""Our diversified portfolio of stabilized income producing properties continues to yield strong results, with revenues up 11.0% and net operating income up 15.8% year to date. New customer rent-to-income ratios remain comfortable at 21.6% while Aimco retained 56.1% of our residents whose leases were expiring during the quarter at rents 15.1% higher, on average, than the previous lease.""Mr. Powell continued, ""Our work over the past few years has better positioned us to weather what are likely to be stormy business and capital markets conditions to come. We fully intend to execute on the development projects we have underway, we will lean on the steady cashflows produced by our portfolio of stabilized apartment communities, we will continue our efforts to source third party capital and make disciplined decisions in regard to the allocation of AIV’s capital; always focusing on its cost and the expected returns of its use on a risk adjusted basis.Story continues""Finally, I am thankful to the Aimco team for their execution and good work, and to the Aimco Board of Directors for their engagement and guidance, as we continue to build, and unlock, value for Aimco shareholders.""Financial Results and Recent HighlightsNet income attributable to common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was $0.19 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to net income per share of $(0.03) for the same period in 2021, due primarily to net gains from real estate transactions in the third quarter, increased tax benefit, and higher net income from property operations.As of October 31, 2022, total shareholder return (""TSR"") since the December 15, 2020 separation from AIR was 57.9% and year-to-date was 3.1%.Year-to-date through October 31, 2022, Aimco has repurchased more than 1.3 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of approximately $6.41 per share.Third Quarter 2022 Revenue and NOI from Aimco’s Stabilized Operating Properties were up 11.5% and 17.5%, respectively, year over year, with average revenue per apartment home of $2,173, up $261 year over year.Aimco closed the previously announced $669 million lease termination transaction with AIR that returned the four leased properties to AIR in exchange for a payment to Aimco of $200 million thereby eliminating the $469 million obligation related to these leased assets. Aimco's execution in the development and lease-up of these assets resulted in Value Creation, net of costs of approximately $100 million for shareholders.Aimco completed the early repayment of the $534 million of notes due to AIR, originally scheduled to mature in January 2024.Aimco exited the Seattle market, closing on the sales of two apartment communities for a total of $122 million.Value Add, Opportunistic &amp; Alternative Investments:Development and RedevelopmentAimco generally seeks development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined, and Aimco has a comparative advantage over others in the market. Aimco’s Value Add and Opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements.As of September 30, 2022, Aimco had four active development and redevelopment projects located in four U.S. markets, in varying phases of construction and lease-up. These projects remain on track, as measured by budget and lease-up metrics. During the third quarter, Aimco invested $60.6 million in development and redevelopment activities. Updates include:At The Hamilton in Miami, Florida, Aimco welcomed the first residents into redesigned and fully renovated units in early October 2022. As of October 31, 2022, 97 units were leased or pre-leased at rental rates more than 20% ahead of underwriting.Construction continues on schedule and on budget at Upton Place in Northwest Washington, D.C., the Benson Hotel and Faculty Club on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, and at our single-family home development project, Oak Shore, in Corte Madera, California.Alternative InvestmentsAimco makes alternative investments where it has special knowledge or expertise relevant to the venture and where opportunity exists for positive asymmetric outcomes. Aimco’s current alternative investments include a mezzanine loan secured by a stabilized multifamily property with an option to participate in future multifamily development as well as three passive equity investments. Updates include:The borrower on Aimco’s $362.8 million mezzanine loan, which is secured by the Parkmerced stabilized multifamily property plus phases two through nine of the site's future development opportunity, remains current on its first mortgage obligations. Due to the relative size of Aimco’s investment and alternative accretive uses of capital, Aimco initiated a marketing effort in July to explore opportunities to monetize all or a portion of its investment. Increased uncertainty within financial and capital markets led us to extend the timeline related to this process and its execution.Investment ActivityAimco is focused on development and redevelopment, funded primarily through joint ventures. Aimco will also consider opportunistic investments in related activities. Updates include:As previously announced, in July and August, Aimco closed on the purchase of two development parcels, completing the assemblage it contracted to acquire, for $100 million, in February 2022. The nine-acre assemblage is located in the rapidly growing Flagler Village neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and allows for approximately three million square feet of phased, mixed-use development, which could contain up to 1,500 residential units, more than 300 hotel keys, and more than 100,000 square feet of retail space at full build-out.Operating Property ResultsAimco owns a diversified portfolio of operating apartment communities located in eight major U.S. markets with average rents in line with local market averages. Aimco also owns one commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building.Aimco’s operating properties produced solid results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.Third QuarterYear-to-DateStabilized Operating PropertiesYear-over-YearSequentialYear-over-Year($ in millions)20222021Variance2Q 2022Variance20222021VarianceAverage Daily Occupancy96.0%97.9%(1.9)%97.7%(1.7%)97.4%97.7%(0.3%)Revenue, before utility reimbursements$34.7$31.111.5%$33.14.7%$100.0$90.111.0%Expenses, net of utility reimbursements10.210.3(0.7%)10.4(2.0%)30.930.41.5%Net operating income (NOI)24.520.817.5%22.77.8%69.159.715.8%*Excluded from the table above is one, 40-unit apartment community that Aimco’s ownership includes a partnership share.Revenue in the third quarter 2022 was $34.7 million, up 11.5% year-over-year, resulting from a $261 increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to $2,173, offset with a 190-basis point decrease in Average Daily Occupancy to 96.0%.

Leases within the building have been executed on terms of less than four years or contain redevelopment provisions as needed to maximize the value of the underlying development rights.Property DispositionsYear to date, Aimco has sold three stabilized properties at values exceeding those used in Aimco's internal NAV estimate. Net proceeds from the sales were primarily used to reduce leverage. In the third quarter, Aimco completed the sale of two of the three properties sold:In July, Aimco sold Cedar Rim, a 104-unit apartment community located in Renton, Washington, for $53.0 million.In August, Aimco sold 2900 on First, a 135-unit apartment community with 14,000 square feet of retail located in Seattle, Washington for $69.0 million.As previously announced, in September Aimco closed the $669 million lease termination transaction with AIR that returned the four leased properties to AIR in exchange for a payment to Aimco of $200 million thereby eliminating the $469 million obligation related to these leased assets.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is MINISO Group Holding Limited (MNSO). MNSO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 10.91 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 10.93. Over the past year, MNSO's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.32 and as low as 8, with a median of 15.83.We also note that MNSO holds a PEG ratio of 0.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MNSO's industry has an average PEG of 0.70 right now. Within the past year, MNSO's PEG has been as high as 0.35 and as low as 0.18, with a median of 0.22.Another notable valuation metric for MNSO is its P/B ratio of 1.85. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.63. Over the past year, MNSO's P/B has been as high as 5.07 and as low as 1.26, with a median of 2.17.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Retail - Apparel and Shoes value stock, take a look at Tapestry (TPR). TPR is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Tapestry is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 7.48 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.60. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 10.93 and average PEG ratio of 0.70.Over the past year, TPR's P/E has been as high as 13.39, as low as 6.70, with a median of 8.81; its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.09, as low as 0.57, with a median of 0.22 during the same time period.Additionally, Tapestry has a P/B ratio of 3.17 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.63. For TPR, this valuation metric has been as high as 4.14, as low as 2.63, with a median of 3.46 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in MINISO Group Holding Limited and Tapestry strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

284,dec23918-7405-3806-b57d-3475be00812e,SWK,2022-11-08,"Is Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) Trading At A 30% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stanley-black-decker-inc-nyse-122641881.html,1667910401,STORY,['SWK'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Stanley Black &amp; Decker The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.24bUS$1.11bUS$1.05bUS$1.26bUS$1.27bUS$1.28bUS$1.30bUS$1.32bUS$1.34bUS$1.36bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.56%Est @ 0.98%Est @ 1.28%Est @ 1.49%Est @ 1.64%Est @ 1.74% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.1% US$1.1kUS$936US$808US$890US$820US$759US$705US$656US$611US$570(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.9bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.1%– 2.0%) = US$20bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$20b÷ ( 1 + 9.1%)10= US$8.2bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$16b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$76.5, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Stanley Black &amp; Decker as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.386. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, we've compiled three important aspects you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Stanley Black &amp; Decker has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for SWK's future outlook?

Reuters first reported the existence of the new product, which was later confirmed by the Santa Clara-based Nvidia.""The Nvidia A800 GPU, which went into production in Q3, is another alternative product to the Nvidia A100 GPU for customers in China,"" an Nvidia spokesman said in a statement.

The country accounts for about one quarter of Nvidia's total gross sales. Third-quarter sales losses from the ban were estimated at about US$400 million, the company said earlier.A Beijing-based chip distributor told the South China Morning Post that it has already started promoting the A800 to Chinese clients as an alternative to the A100, which was introduced in 2020.Nvidia has played a pivotal role in supplying the chips that power China's progress in artificial intelligence (AI), data analysis and high performance computing. As such, the US ban dealt a heavy blow to the country's ability to develop sophisticated AI models, which are trained using powerful processors from US suppliers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as GPUs from Nvidia.Story continuesNvidia's data centre business, which includes the two advanced chips, posted 61 per cent year on year growth and US$3.8 billion in sales in the quarter ended June 2022.Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming in this undated photo provided September 20, 2022.

You can skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and current market trends and go directly to see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back.In the third quarter of 2022, inflation pressures resulted in central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy. Nominal and real bond yields have been pushed to their highest levels in over a decade as a result, with the market being thrown into a downturn. According to a Fidelity Investments report published this year, profit growth has been decelerating while remaining positive, while expectations for earnings growth among S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at 10%.As a result of the inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, the country is thrown into a state of confusion. We aren't in a recession, yet major companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), among others, are thus seeing significant decreases in their stock prices. Many are trading at historically low levels, offering investors the opportunity to buy them while they are affordable.However, the S&amp;P 500 has begun its recovery. In October, the broader benchmark posted gains of 7.99% for the month. Technology stocks are getting hammered while energy and certain healthcare stocks are doing really well this year. Overall, the benchmark is still down 18.76% year-to-date. As a result, now is the best time to buy renowned companies at a discounted rate, to benefit from future profits.Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look BackImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMany investors believe that the stock market is efficient. We disagree. The 52-week price range for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is $108 and $346. That's an extremely wide range. Was NVDA efficiently priced when it was trading at $346? How about at $108? Did the future cash flows of NVDA go down by two thirds in a matter of 12 months? We believe the stock market gets overly pessimistic right before the market bottoms and that's usually a very good time to buy for long-term investors. Selling stocks when the earnings and the P/E multiples peak is also a good idea. We don't think we are near the bottom yet, but we are getting close. It is time to get prepared which is why we are going to take a look at the following 10 stocks that we can buy on sale and stay invested for the long-term.Story continuesOur Methodology:For our list below, we have selected stocks with significant long-term growth potential despite their share prices falling this year.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8.

(NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Share Price as of November 4: $90.40NIKE, Inc.

The company provides its products under the Jumpman, Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron, and Jack Purcell trademarks. It is based in Beaverton, Oregon.Raymond James' Rick Patel initiated coverage of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares on October 13 with an Outperform rating and a $99 price target.While current market headwinds make most investors wary of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), the company's strong fundamentals cannot go ignored. It has managed to beat earnings estimates for the past four quarters consistently. In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, the company's EPS was $0.93, beating estimates by $0.01. Its revenue was $12.69 billion, up 3.58% year-over-year, and beating estimates by $399.97 million. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was also the biggest gainer in the Dow 30 stocks at the start of October, rising 3.25% and coming up to more than 12% in partial recovery.

Their total stake values were $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.RiverPark Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Share Price as of November 4: $134.21NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an information technology company providing graphics, and compute and networking solutions in the US, Taiwan, China, and internationally.

This October, the company's shares were down by 56% over the past year, meaning the time is perfect to buy the stock at a bargain. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a significant upside potential of 44%-45%.Catherine Wood's ARK Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter, holding 1.4 million shares worth $167.8 million. In total, 84 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $3.3 billion.Baron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), is a growth stock forecasted to continue beating the market in the coming years. As such, it is the best stock to buy while it's still affordable. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back. Suggested articles:11 Best Future Food Stocks To Buy11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest InDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:V) continues to report strong double-digit growth in payment volumes throughout the first two months of the calendar third quarter. The stock suffered after concerns about potential adverse legislation related to its credit card routing practices began to surface. Similar legislation related to the Company’s debit routing practices was passed into law back in 2010. Not unlike the previous legislation, the Company’s value proposition to merchants, consumers and bank-issuing customers and acquirers is robust enough to help blunt the potential effects the legislation might have in the near term. Over a multiyear time horizon, it would be quite difficult for any currently non-existent or even sub-scale credit routing network to add the value that Visa (or MasterCard) can already add today.”10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 1.07%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics.

(NYSE:SPGI), down from 97 in the previous quarter. These stakes hold a collective value of over $7.2 billion.Baron Funds mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9.

Willscot Mobile Mini is another compounder that executed well through the pandemic but was not initially recognized for the synergies of its Mobile Mini acquisition. The deal has reduced costs and created greater operating leverage as the company rides the tailwinds of improving industrial production and construction.”6.

This merger would bring back high-profile business divisions under one roof after a split in 2013. Fox’s Fox News, Fox broadcast network, local TV stations and the Tubi streaming service would be combined with News Corp’s Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets, including HarperCollins Publishers and news organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia.This would diversify and broaden the portfolio of Fox Corporation, hence gaining traction with more customers and adding new sources of revenue.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox has also entered a multi-year deal with VIZIO VZIO to expand its distribution partnership. The Fox Sports app will now be available on VIZIO smart TVs along with the Fox Weather channel being added to VIZIO WatchFree+ besides existing Fox ad-supported LiveNOW and Fox Soul. VIZIO Ads will also have access to Fox’s premium inventory for audience-based opportunities with advertisers.Story continuesIn August, Fox announced the completion of a multi-year renewal of its distribution agreement with Verizon for its Fios TV platform.The agreement included the continued distribution of the entire portfolio of FOX brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, FOX Network and local FOX O&amp;O TV stations in markets including New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. FOX Weather has also been added to the Fios TV lineup and Tubi is included in both Fios TV set-top boxes, as well as on many other platforms. Threats Attached to the DealsThese mergers and acquisitions and partnerships are expected to bolster Fox’s top line, but they also bring certain headwinds for the company.The wagering business, into which Fox is expanding, is highly competitive with companies like DraftKings DKNG having already established a secure market position in the sports betting industry.DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.The merger with News Corporation also brings some risks for Fox. Readers’ preference for accessing news online, mostly free, has made News Corporation’s print-advertising model increasingly redundant. Besides, a major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues is generated outside the United States. The ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength may hurt both the top and bottom lines of the company.This has not boded well among the investors. The shares of Fox Corporation, which currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have declined 19.1% year to date compared to Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fox filed a claim in 2021 against Flutter last year, saying that the amount it should pay for the stake ought to be linked to the $11.2B value of FanDuel when Flutter last increased its holding in 2020.This would have implied a lower price tag for Fox's potential purchase.However, the arbitration tribunal found that the option should instead be based on a valuation of FanDuel of $20B with an annual compounding carrying value adjustment of 5%. When including this figure, that would mean that Fox would have to pay over $4B for the stake in FanDuel.Had the ruling been reversed, Flutter would have been forced to sell a stake at a sharply discounted rate. Fox now has until 2030 to make its purchase.""Today's ruling vindicates the confidence we had in our position on this matter and provides certainty on what it would cost FOX to buy into this business, should they wish to do so,"" said Flutter chief executive officer Peter Jackson in a statement.Analysts at Morgan Stanley called the arbitration outcome a ""net positive"" for Flutter, adding that it adds clarity to the future shape and ownership of FanDuel. The analysts also lifted their price target for Flutter to 16.000p from 15.800p.Fox claimed its own victory following the ruling, pointing in particular to the 10-year option it has to buy a stake in a ""market leading"" operation.

You can skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and current market trends and go directly to see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back.In the third quarter of 2022, inflation pressures resulted in central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to tighten monetary policy. Nominal and real bond yields have been pushed to their highest levels in over a decade as a result, with the market being thrown into a downturn. According to a Fidelity Investments report published this year, profit growth has been decelerating while remaining positive, while expectations for earnings growth among S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at 10%.As a result of the inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, the country is thrown into a state of confusion. We aren't in a recession, yet major companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), among others, are thus seeing significant decreases in their stock prices. Many are trading at historically low levels, offering investors the opportunity to buy them while they are affordable.However, the S&amp;P 500 has begun its recovery. In October, the broader benchmark posted gains of 7.99% for the month. Technology stocks are getting hammered while energy and certain healthcare stocks are doing really well this year. Overall, the benchmark is still down 18.76% year-to-date. As a result, now is the best time to buy renowned companies at a discounted rate, to benefit from future profits.Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look BackImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMany investors believe that the stock market is efficient. We disagree. The 52-week price range for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is $108 and $346. That's an extremely wide range. Was NVDA efficiently priced when it was trading at $346? How about at $108? Did the future cash flows of NVDA go down by two thirds in a matter of 12 months? We believe the stock market gets overly pessimistic right before the market bottoms and that's usually a very good time to buy for long-term investors. Selling stocks when the earnings and the P/E multiples peak is also a good idea. We don't think we are near the bottom yet, but we are getting close. It is time to get prepared which is why we are going to take a look at the following 10 stocks that we can buy on sale and stay invested for the long-term.Story continuesOur Methodology:For our list below, we have selected stocks with significant long-term growth potential despite their share prices falling this year. We have considered current projects and operations the companies are involved in to determine whether they are truly on the path to growth in the long term. We have also looked at key fundamentals such as their revenue and free cash flow growth and guidance, alongside looking at analyst ratings and price targets. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back10. Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Share Price as of November 4: $81.93Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc.

It sees more opportunities in the market this year, and has an operating revenue of $226 million, which is 24% higher than its $184 million operating revenue in the first quarter of 2021. While there is general pessimism in the commercial real estate market, Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc.

(NYSE:WD) in the second quarter, holding 327,036 shares worth $31.5 million. In total, 16 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $100.3 million.Walker &amp; Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:WD), like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), is among the best stocks to buy on the dip at present.9. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Share Price as of November 4: $13.26Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is an automobile manufacturer that services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles across the globe. The company operates through its Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments, and it is based in Dearborn, Michigan. It also offers wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory.An Overweight rating was reiterated on shares of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) by Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley on October 27.Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is trading exceptionally cheap right now, but the company shows room for share price growth based on strong fundamentals. The company raised its free cash flow guidance for 2022 this October, bringing it up to $9.5 billion - $10 billion, compared to the previous figures of $5.5 billion - $6.5 billion. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also saw a 10% year-over-year increase in its revenue in the third quarter.Out of 895 hedge funds tracked in the second quarter, 46 funds were long Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), with a total stake value of $608.8 million. In comparison, 46 funds were long the stock in the previous quarter as well, with a total stake value of $1.2 billion.Leaven Partners, an investment management firm, mentioned Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Share Price as of November 4: $84.68Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a consumer discretionary company operating as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee across the glove. The company operates through its North America, International, and Channel Development segments and offers coffee and tea beverages, roasted whole beans and ground coffee, single-serve products, and ready-to-drink beverages across its stores internationally. It is based in Seattle, Washington.Joshua Long at Stephens initiated coverage of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares on September 22 with an Equal Weight rating and a $91 price target.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a blue-chip stock you can buy today at a bargain since it has historically been undervalued by 16%, yet has the ability to deliver returns of almost 150% within the next five years. The company's management is guiding for 17%-22.5% CAGR long-term returns, and analysts also think 17% is likely. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) boosted its growth outlook by 2% annually in the long-term growth plan outlined in the company's 2022 investor day held this September. The company has also guided for 10%-12% annual sales growth.Bailard Inc was the largest stakeholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the second quarter, holding 71,319 shares worth $6 million. There were 55 hedge funds long the stock in total, with a total stake value of $1.4 billion.Polen Capital, an investment management firm, mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Share Price as of November 4: $90.40NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a footwear company that designs, develops, markets, and sells men's women's, and kids' athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories across the globe. The company provides its products under the Jumpman, Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron, and Jack Purcell trademarks. It is based in Beaverton, Oregon.Raymond James' Rick Patel initiated coverage of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares on October 13 with an Outperform rating and a $99 price target.While current market headwinds make most investors wary of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), the company's strong fundamentals cannot go ignored. It has managed to beat earnings estimates for the past four quarters consistently. In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, the company's EPS was $0.93, beating estimates by $0.01. Its revenue was $12.69 billion, up 3.58% year-over-year, and beating estimates by $399.97 million. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was also the biggest gainer in the Dow 30 stocks at the start of October, rising 3.25% and coming up to more than 12% in partial recovery. The company's robust fundamentals and persistence in maintaining earnings records can lead to its further growth in the coming years, especially as recession fears die down.NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) was found among the 13F holdings of 72 hedge funds in the second quarter, and 67 funds in the previous quarter. Their total stake values were $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.RiverPark Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Share Price as of November 4: $134.21NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an information technology company providing graphics, and compute and networking solutions in the US, Taiwan, China, and internationally. The company is a key player in the semiconductor space, and is based in Santa Clara, California. Its products are used in the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets.A Buy rating was reiterated on shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) on October 25 by analyst Rajvindra Gill at Needham. The analyst also placed a $155 price target on the stock.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has shown strong forward guidance estimates for the next five years, showing that investing in the company now will be smart seeing as it is set to keep growing in the future. This October, the company's shares were down by 56% over the past year, meaning the time is perfect to buy the stock at a bargain. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a significant upside potential of 44%-45%.Catherine Wood's ARK Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter, holding 1.4 million shares worth $167.8 million. In total, 84 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $3.3 billion.Baron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), is a growth stock forecasted to continue beating the market in the coming years. As such, it is the best stock to buy while it's still affordable. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back. Suggested articles:11 Best Future Food Stocks To Buy11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest InDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

These products will detect and block malware at the edge and prevent it from reaching the targeted destination, thereby thwarting damage from spreading.The company also launched several application security features designed to help organizations thwart cybersecurity threats during API interactions and at the edge.

It has amassed assets over $3.98 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap ValueSmall cap companies have market capitalization below $2 billion. They usually have higher potential than large and mid cap companies with stocks but higher risk.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.98%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 22.20% of the portfolio. Industrials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Helmerich &amp; Payne Inc. (HP) accounts for about 0.95% of total assets, followed by South Jersey Industries Inc. (SJI) and Pbf Energy Inc. Class A (PBF).The top 10 holdings account for about 7.21% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskSLYV seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Value Index before fees and expenses. The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Value Index measures the performance of the small-capitalization value sector in the U.S. equity market. The selection universe for the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index includes all U.S. common equities listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Select Market and NASDAQ Capital Market with market capitalizations between $250 million and $1.2 billion.The ETF has lost about -10.37% so far this year and is down about -13.71% in the last one year (as of 11/08/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $67.14 and $90.07.The ETF has a beta of 1.17 and standard deviation of 32.62% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 464 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR S&amp;P 600 Small Cap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SLYV is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and the Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $12.15 billion in assets, Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF has $23.40 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

315,209c0404-7ce9-36cc-bcb9-bbb3def7a31e,HP,2022-11-08,Ovintiv (OVV) Q3 Earnings Coming Up: Here's How It Will Fare,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ovintiv-ovv-q3-earnings-coming-144502311.html,1667832302,STORY,"['OVV', 'HP']","[Ovintiv Inc. OVV is set to release third-quarter results on Nov 8. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $1.98 per share on revenues of $2.5 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent energy producer’s results in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at OVV’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Denver, CO-based upstream player missed the consensus mark due to a year-over-year dip in production and much higher costs. OVV had reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.42, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69. However, revenues of $3.7 billion generated by the firm stormed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.7 billion on the back of higher price realizations.Ovintiv missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters, resulting in a negative earnings surprise of 7.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Ovintiv Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOvintiv Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOvintiv Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ovintiv Inc. Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 32% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 40.8% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderOvintiv is expected to have benefited from robust commodity price realizations. In the April-to-June period, the company’s realized natural gas price was $2.78 per thousand cubic feet compared with the year-ago level of $2.74. The realized oil price increased to $89.16 per barrel from $51.27 in the third quarter of 2021. The uptick is most likely to have continued in the third quarter, with oil and gas prices remaining strong on the back of geopolitical tensions and tight fundamentals. This price boost is likely to have buoyed the revenues and cash flows of OVV.On a somewhat bearish note, the decrease in Ovintiv’s production might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line as it pivots toward a steady output profile to stress on shareholder returns. Consequently, the consensus mark for OVV’s average Q3 volume is pegged at 503,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), down from the prior-year quarter’s level of 535,300 BOE/d.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Ovintiv is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Ovintiv has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.98 per share each.Zacks Rank: OVV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Ovintiv, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. HP has an Earnings ESP of +14.32% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on Nov 16.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For fiscal 2022, Helmerich &amp; Payne has a projected earnings growth rate of 100%.

317,2aff722b-9a02-30e3-b779-659551f67ddb,NDAQ,2022-11-08,How to Operationalize ESG,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/operationalize-esg-142500475.html,1667831100,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 7, 2022 / Nasdaq, Inc.:As we enter 2021, environmental, social and governance (ESG) continues to be a top priority for boards and management teams. Karen Snow, Senior Vice President and Head of East Coast Listings and Capital Services at Nasdaq, interviews veteran board member Betsy Atkins to get her insights on how to operationalize ESG.What specific advice do you have for public company directors?Directors can start the process by looking at the many good policies your corporations already have in place. The opportunity is to communicate your existing excellent practices in your HR organization which are of course equal pay, inclusion and diversity, wellness, safety.Likely all your companies are good corporate citizens and are efficient with water and energy and don't pollute. Your supply chains likely are not using endangered species/rare wood or child labor. Likely, your policies on cyber are in place to do appropriate oversight software patching and updating and you have anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies. You likely have appropriate data privacy policies.Start by capturing the information you already have in house and communicating this in your annual report, CEO letter, website and proxy.There are many ESG frameworks. The stock exchange data seems to show that the SASB framework in combination with the MSCI rating agency seems to correlate to very high returns. Additionally, Larry Fink of BlackRock endorses SASB and MSCI.Pick the frameworks that are most appropriate for your industry / business and the rating agencies where your companies results will be rewarded.Start by quantifying what you're doing by organizing, measuring and communicating your data. It's the first step as boards look to embrace E.S.G. and communicate it.Is ESG something private companies should do or only public companies?ESG reporting is not a one and done. It should be part of your company's annual reports to your different stakeholders that show your progress towards its ESG goals.Story continuesESG is not just for public companies. Private companies are well served to integrate ESG into the overall strategy as it can be extremely advantageous and a positive differentiator.External ESG reporting gives your customers and employees key insights into your brands mission vision and values; it is an opportunity to augment your brand halo.Strong ESG reporting is also a positive when/if you are seeking funding either privately or on the public market. Investors will value a strong ESG stance and you will be granted access to larger pools of stickier capital.What external influences will speed ESG adoption?First and foremost, the regulatory landscape will of course help drive and speed up adoption. Companies would be well served to try and get out ahead of the inevitable regulation coming from both public and private sectors.Also, the evolving view of what exactly a boards fiduciary duty will also speed ESG adoption. Canada, Sweden, and the UK have taken steps to expand the scope of the concept of a fiduciary duty. Will Martindale, head of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), even said that ""Failing to integrate ESG issues is a failure of fiduciary duty.""Another factor that will speed ESG adoption is the market. Customers want to shop at businesses whose practices align with their values and employees want to work for a company that is a good corporate citizen and has clear purpose and value.You mentioned some of the regulatory steps taken in Europe to expand the definition of fiduciary duty. Is Europe ahead on ESG? It seems to be.Well, regulatory trends tend to start in Europe and then make their way across the pond.The EU was ahead of regulating platform giants and focusing on consumer data privacy (GDRP) and we see that topic trending now in the US. In 2012 the European Commission put forward a law aiming to accelerate the addition of more women on boards to reach gender parity and of course now in the US gender diversity (among other forms of diversity) is a topic that is on everyone's mind.When it comes to ESG, 85% of European investors compared to 49% of US investors say they are incorporating ESG factors into their investment analysis.ESG is gaining momentum in the US and companies should expect an influx of activity and interest in the coming year from all their various stakeholders (shareholders, customers, employees, communities, etc.).Do some industries lead in ESG? If yes, which ones?Whichever industry you are in, it is important to begin the process of ESG reporting so you can see where you stand relevant to your peers. You don't want to fall behind the bell curve and become a laggard.It is also important to be sure you are reporting on ESG factors that are material to your industry sector. A software company reporting on their water usage is perhaps not as strong an indicator of their ESG practices as what their consumer data privacy policies are.Across all industries there are leaders and there are laggards when it comes to ESG; evaluate where you are relative to your peers and focus on areas where you can improve and show measurable growth.Are all industries adopting ESG at the same pace?No, and that is ok. It may be easier to adopt ESG practices if you are a services economy company i.e. an agile growth SaaS company that really doesn't have high carbon emissions or high water usage, etc. compared to a company in a so called real economy heavy industries such as oil and gas or mining.However, adopting a ""wait and see"" approach to ESG is not going to cut it anymore no matter what your industry is.Investors and all your other stakeholders want to see that you have set thoughtful, measurable goals that are relevant to your business and that you can report and show progress towards these goals along the way. ESG is not a one and done exercise - it is an ongoing journey and is something that needs to be interwoven with the overall strategy and direction of a company.Has COVID-19 impacted company commitments to ESG?It is well known that Covid has sped up digital transformation and tech enablement by 5-10 years, but it has also sped up ESG adoption and many companies have ramped up their commitments to ESG.This global crisis has been an opportunity for companies to operationalize their culture and has highlighted the need to focus on employee wellness and reevaluate how to best meet the needs of customers.I believe that companies with strong ESG policies in place will outperform their peers in this strained economy.Consumers are increasingly interested in whether the companies they support are good corporate citizens with values that align with their own. Consumers (particularly demographics such as Millennials and Gen Z) are eager to support companies with good external messaging around their ESG practices.Are all stakeholders equally influential in driving ESG adoption? Which stakeholders will have the most impact: employees, customers, investors, community?ESG is more important than ever to all stakeholders.Having ESG be an integral part of the company strategy will enable you to attract and retain the best talent. Highly skilled employees are desirable, and they want to work for a company that as clear values and a mission driven purpose.Your customers will be loyal to your company if you have positive brand halo and a strong reputation.Investors will increasingly be considering ESG factors when evaluating companies. Having a strong narrative will enable your company to have access to bigger and differentiated pools of stickier capital.Will companies be penalized for incomplete ESG reporting?You will be penalized if you don't have anything you are reporting re ESG programs.Your various constituencies will reward you for starting the process even if your implementation of your goals is incomplete.You need to pick the frameworks that are most appropriate for your industry and pick the rating agency where you will be most rewarded. For example, if you're a high emitting real economy industry like oil/gas, mining, etc. reporting a climate goal is especially an important focus, the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) would be a framework you would want to look at.Start by quantifying and measuring the things your company is already doing and set measurable goals. Don't hesitate to share these goals with your various constituencies even if you are not there yet in terms of being able to report on progress.Investors want to see that you have an ESG narrative and a plan that has specific quantifiable metrics they can get behind.What should boards expect in this upcoming proxy season? Will activists be using ESG?In the past, financial under performance made you a target for activist activity.Now ESG is the trojan horse for activists who are citing issues such as lack of diversity, poor environmental policies, etc. This year Elliott suggested in a public letter to Evergy that they consider reducing their carbon footprint. Third Point send a letter to Prudential saying that having a London HQ for their American and Asian businesses creates an excessive carbon footprint.As a company you can prophylactically immunize yourself from activists by refreshing your board and proactively reviewing policies related to environmentalism, human capital management and other social issues that are material to your business.Nasdaq, Inc., Monday, November 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724221/How-to-Operationalize-ESG]"

The Ready for Business Fund was founded in the summer of 2020 with an initial $100,000 investment from Comcast and designation of GSBA as the fund manager. To date, the fund has supported more than 200 small businesses in Washington with nearly $1 million in financial support and wraparound services.The Ready for Business Fund was renewed this year with an additional $75,000 in funding from Comcast and GSBA, reprising its role as the program and fund manager. Grants from the Ready for Business Fund will be made possible by more than $150,000 in additional donations from Pepsi, T-Mobile, US Bank, Meta, and Verity Credit Union and a $100,000 grant from King County. These funds will now support small business owners across all industries, including local restaurants, bookstores, bistros, shops and stores, which are an important part of the social fabric in our communities.“GSBA recognizes the importance of investing in the small businesses that are critical to a thriving community and economy,” said Ilona Lohrey, GSBA president and CEO. “We are proud to once again partner with Comcast to grow our Ready for Business Fund to support a diverse group of business owners who need our help now more than ever.”The Ready for Business Fund was created to support small businesses in Washington, especially those owned by LGBTQ people, Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC), and women, who are at greater risk in today’s uncertain economy. Grant recipients also include small businesses located in rural areas of Washington that lack proximity to resources.Story continues“We're grateful for our continued partnership with the GSBA to recognize so many resilient small businesses through the Ready for Business Fund,” said Diem Ly, Community Impact director, Comcast Washington. “We at Comcast believe and act on our shared value that ensuring equitable access to resources for BIPOC and LGBTQ-owned businesses means all of our communities and neighborhoods benefit in the long-run.” Feel free to adjust as you see fit!“Between recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns over inflation, our small businesses have faced some of the most difficult struggles over the last few years, and it is up to our community to step up and support them. That’s why partnerships like the one between King County, GSBA and Comcast are so imperative right now,” shared King County Councilmember Joe McDermott.GSBA assembled a selection committee consisting of diverse community and business leaders to evaluate the applications received. Notifications to grant applicants about the status of their application have begun and awards will be delivered beginning this week. All grant recipients will also receive wrap-around services, including GSBA membership and consulting.Ready for Business Fund grant recipients include:Business NameLocationNature’s TwistAuburnSparks DesignsBellinghamSeattle SpartansBothellAmano SeattleBurienBallyhoo TheatreEdmondsKO-AM TVFederal WayYolo West Coast LLCFederal WayIssaquah Eataeries, LLCIssaquahThat Curl GirlKennewickThe honest beautyKennewickSouth 2 West Boiled Peanuts, LLCLynnwoodBurial Grounds Coffee CollectiveOlympiaRUZICKA CPA, PLLCOlympiaStrong Family Bonds LLC dba SGT.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -0.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of +60.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.85 points to a change of +150.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.23 indicates a change of +4.3% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $5.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.8%. The $19.77 billion and $19.74 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +65.9% and -0.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.96%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.31%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.14%.Coming into today, shares of the software maker had gained 20.08% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 7.82%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.41%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Oracle as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.17, down 3.31% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $12.04 billion, up 16.18% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.97 per share and revenue of $49.59 billion, which would represent changes of +1.43% and +16.83%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.32% lower. Oracle is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).In terms of valuation, Oracle is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 15.3. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.12, so we one might conclude that Oracle is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that ORCL has a PEG ratio of 1.91 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.96 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 124, putting it in the top 50% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The longest portion of the offering, a 30-year note, yields 2.55 percentage points above Treasuries after earlier discussions of about 3.1 percentage points, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.Oracle announced, along with the bond sale, that it also increased its previous $4.4 billion term loan by $1.3 billion. The added proceeds will help pay down a bridge loan used to fund the acquisition of Cerner, according to a filing.The Cerner acquisition was originally funded with about $15.7 billion of so-called bridge loan debt provided by a group of banks. Such debt is typically refinanced into longer-term bonds and loans. Oracle later borrowed about $4.4 billion through a term loan agreement, using that to reduce the bridge facility.The proceeds of the bond sale will prepay borrowings under the bridge deal. With the bond sale and the added proceeds of the term loan, there’s about $3 billion left to fund in the bond market from the bridge loan.Austin, Texas-based Oracle originally agreed to buy Cerner for $28 billion in December, in an all-cash deal that would broaden its customer base within the health-care industry and bolster its cloud-computing and database businesses.“Today’s Oracle deal has been anticipated for months, and we expect healthy participation from the buyside even though it’s a company that has been remarkably inattentive to maintaining its credit rating profile,” said Baylor Lancaster-Samuel, vice president of fixed income at Amerant Investments Inc., in an emailed response to questions.Story continues“As recently as 2020, Oracle was rated high A and with the Cerner deal, there was some threat that Oracle could flirt with a BBB- rating at the lowest rung of investment grade,” she said.Fitch Ratings downgraded Oracle to BBB from BBB+ on Monday. It assigned a BBB score to the new unsecured notes, as did S&amp;P Global Ratings.Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. are managing Oracle’s bond sale, the person said.Oracle is one of 15 companies that sold investment-grade debt on Monday, marking the busiest day in that market by number of deals since the days following Labor Day in September.Firms have been taking advantage of the ease in credit market volatility in recent weeks to launch new deals. Last week, several banks used the window to offload some of their most risky buyout and acquisition debt.On Friday, Canada’s Open Text Corp. kicked off a roughly $3.1 billion leveraged loan sale to help finance its purchase of British software business Micro Focus International Plc. Earlier that same week, banks launched a $2.4 billion debt sale to help fund Apollo Global Management Inc.’s buyout of auto-parts maker Tenneco Inc., which the group had previously resigned to funding itself.(Updates language to show bond priced starting in headline.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekPeter Thiel’s Strategy of Pushing the GOP Right Is Just Getting StartedWill the No. 2 Movie Theater Chain Find a Happy Ending?Binance’s Thumping of FTX Shows How Centralized Crypto Can BeCredit Suisse Spinoff Asks If World Needs a New Investment BankSeizing a Russian Superyacht Is Much More Complicated Than You Think©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

334,b4cc27d5-f4e0-386f-9654-1022e987bfc2,FIS,2022-11-08,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Just Missed EPS By 24%: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fidelity-national-information-services-inc-103927653.html,1667903967,STORY,['FIS'],"[One of the biggest stories of last week was how Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) shares plunged 25% in the week since its latest quarterly results, closing yesterday at US$61.85. It looks like a pretty bad result, all things considered. Although revenues of US$3.6b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings fell badly short, missing estimates by 24% to hit US$0.41 per share. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services earnings-and-revenue-growthTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Fidelity National Information Services' 32 analysts is for revenues of US$15.2b in 2023, which would reflect a reasonable 5.0% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 78% to US$2.81. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$15.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.90 in 2023. It's pretty clear that pessimism has reared its head after the latest results, leading to a weaker revenue outlook and a small dip in earnings per share estimates.The consensus price target fell 19% to US$89.45, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Fidelity National Information Services at US$150 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$63.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.Story continuesOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Fidelity National Information Services' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.0% annualised growth rate until the end of 2023 being well below the historical 13% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 11% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Fidelity National Information Services is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.The Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates revenues are expected to perform worse than the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business.With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Fidelity National Information Services. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Fidelity National Information Services analysts - going out to 2024, and you can see them free on our platform here.It is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Fidelity National Information Services that you need to take into consideration.Have feedback on this article?

The leader in that field is Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (NYSE:FIS), which recently gave investors some insight into the state of the economy. Unfortunately, it was not great and, as a result, the stock suffered a steep one-day decline.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with FIS. Click here to check it out. FIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FISPeter Lynch Chart of FISFidelity National Information Services Is the Canary in a Coal MineAlso known as FIS, the company provides advanced technology solutions for merchants, banks and capital markets firms worldwide. It operates through three distinct segments. The first, Merchant Solutions, provides enterprise and small business payment processing solutions as well e-commerce solutions to online retailers. The Banking Solutions segment provides core processing and ancillary applications such as digital banking, fraud, risk management and compliance solutions. The Capital Market Solutions segment offers securities processing, global trading, asset management, insurance and corporate liquidity solutions.Founded in 1968, Fidelity National currently has a market capitalization of $35 billion.Industry updateThe current macroeconomic climate has created some challenges for the company as it is seeing what it called a broader economic slowdown, In the banking segment, it has observed longer sales cycles for large deals (over $50 million) as banks become cautious with their spending, even though the pipeline remains strong. In the merchant segment, the company mentioned it has detected early signs of domestic consumer shifting spending habits from discretionary to nondiscretionary verticals, which pressures its margins. The U.K. represents about 15% of merchant segment revenue and the company indicated spending slowdowns there as well. In the capital markets segment, the macroeconomic environment was not as impacted.Story continuesFinancial reviewOn Nov. 3, the company released third-quarter results that were somewhat disappointing. Organic revenue increased 5% to $3.6 billion, while the adjusted Ebitda decreased 1% to $1.57 billion. The Ebitda margin decreased to 43.7% from 45.2% compared to the year-ago quarter. Net earnings also decreased 1% to $1.05 billion compared to $1.07 billion the prior-year period. The banking and merchant segments both showed operating margin contraction while the capital markets segment was able to increase margins.In a statement, outgoing Chairman and CEO Gary Norcross commented on Fidelity National's performance.Despite deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, FIS delivered third quarter revenue and earnings in-line with its prior outlook. We are taking actions to ensure the company is well positioned to drive profitable growth as we continue to face an uncertain macroenvironment,"" he said.The company generated free cash flow of $684 million during the quarter, paid $284 million in dividends and repurchased shares totaling approximately $1 billion. Unfortunately, these share repurchases were made at much higher prices as the stock plummeted 25% after the earnings release.The balance sheet carries a lot of debt, which totaled $18.9 billion at quarter-end. The company has made many acquisitions throughout its history, which were mostly financed by debt. The leverage ratio is a still reasonable at 2.9 and the average interest rate is only 2%.ValuationThe company lowered its 2022 guidance to $14.5 billion in revenue, $6.2 billion in adjusted Ebitda and earnings per share of $6.63. The primary culprits were the macroeconomic environment, inflationary pressures and sales execution. That puts Fidelity's stock selling at 9 times the current year's earnings. The enterprise value/Ebitda ratio is also approximately 9 due to the high levels of debt on the balance sheet.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator creates a value of approximately $90 using $6.63 in earnings per share as the starting point and a long-term growth rate of 6%. Using the reverse DCF model, the current stock price implies almost no future growth in earnings.The company is committed to paying a strong dividend with goals of an over 20% annual dividend growth rate and a payout ratio of approximately 35%. The current annualized dividend is $1.88, which creates a dividend yield of 3.12%. Based on 2022 earnings estimates, the payout ratio is 28%, leaving room for upside based on the companys 35% payout ratio target.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased Fidelity National stock recently include Robert Olstein (Trades, Portfolio), Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio) and Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), while those who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio), Louis Moore Bacon (Trades, Portfolio) and Keeley-Teton Advisors, LLC (Trades, Portfolio).ConclusionFidelity National Information Services can often be an economic bellwether due to its end market customer base of banks and merchants. The company is seeing a slowdown along those lines, both domestically and in international markets. However, after a 60% decline from 2021 highs, that bad news may be priced in to the stock.The company is also undergoing a CEO transition with Stephanie Ferris starting on Jan. 1, 2023, which may bring new strategic leadership and growth.Fidelity National ppears to be undervalued based on most metrics and the above-market dividend yield may provide some base stability. For long-term investors, this may be an attractive entry point and there appears to be a decent margin of safety.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NYSE:PLD) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 18% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been respectable. The share price is up 63%, which is better than the market return of 55%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 27% drop, in the last year.While the stock has fallen 4.7% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Prologis To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Prologis managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.2% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 10% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Prologis' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Prologis the TSR over the last 5 years was 85%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePrologis shareholders are down 25% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Prologis (2 are a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Rowe Price (TROW). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Atlas and T. Rowe Price are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ATCO has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ATCO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.52, while TROW has a forward P/E of 13.02. We also note that ATCO has a PEG ratio of 2.38. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TROW currently has a PEG ratio of 2.65.Another notable valuation metric for ATCO is its P/B ratio of 0.97. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TROW has a P/B of 2.52.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to ATCO's Value grade of A and TROW's Value grade of C.ATCO sticks out from TROW in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ATCO is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:V) continues to report strong double-digit growth in payment volumes throughout the first two months of the calendar third quarter. The stock suffered after concerns about potential adverse legislation related to its credit card routing practices began to surface. Similar legislation related to the Company’s debit routing practices was passed into law back in 2010. Not unlike the previous legislation, the Company’s value proposition to merchants, consumers and bank-issuing customers and acquirers is robust enough to help blunt the potential effects the legislation might have in the near term. Over a multiyear time horizon, it would be quite difficult for any currently non-existent or even sub-scale credit routing network to add the value that Visa (or MasterCard) can already add today.”10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Dividend Yield as of November 4: 1.07%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics.

(NYSE:SPGI), down from 97 in the previous quarter. These stakes hold a collective value of over $7.2 billion.Baron Funds mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9.

350,00a4fe08-806a-32bc-a6a2-a71a67db83d9,AXP,2022-11-08,Some Shareholders Feeling Restless Over American Express Company's (NYSE:AXP) P/E Ratio,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-feeling-restless-over-american-140100718.html,1667829660,STORY,['AXP'],"[It's not a stretch to say that American Express Company's  (NYSE:AXP) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 14.4x right now seems quite ""middle-of-the-road"" compared to the market in the United States, where the median P/E ratio is around 14x. Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, American Express has been relatively sluggish. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will turn around. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for American Express peKeen to find out how analysts think American Express' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is American Express' Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like American Express' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 3.9%. The latest three year period has also seen a 21% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 5.6% during the coming year according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 7.8%, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it interesting that American Express is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On American Express' P/EIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Our examination of American Express' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support a more positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with American Express, and understanding should be part of your investment process.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on American Express, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

With this investment, Mondelēz International aims to catalyze ground-breaking sector collaboration to help address systemic environmental and human rights challenges and improve cocoa farmer livelihoods.""As one of the world's leading snacking companies, it is a priority to continue making our most important ingredients, such as cocoa, right, and Cocoa Life sits at the heart of this strategy,"" said Dirk Van de Put, Chairman &amp; CEO, Mondelēz International.

360,f49284f4-dca7-3543-beca-cf2db9e113c5,OXY,2022-11-08,Breaking Down Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Stock Before Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-occidental-petroleum-oxy-233611873.html,1667864171,STORY,"['OXY', 'CL=F', 'NG=F']","[Occidental Petroleum’s OXY third quarter earnings report on November 8 will be heavily covered with famed investor Warren Buffett controlling a significant stake in the company. With many notable energy and oil companies like Chevron CVX and Exxon Mobil XOM seeing their stocks rally after strong earnings reports, investors in OXY will be hoping for the same.Basics Trading near its 52-week high of $77.13 seen in August, a strong Q3 report could help the stock reach new highs. Oil prices have also remained near $90 a barrel making operating conditions favorable for the integrated oil and gas company.OXY’s Oil and Gas-Integrated-United States Industry is in the top 31%, and its strong business and growth have catapulted the stock over the last year. Occidental Petroleum has significant exploration and production exposure and produces a variety of chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers, and specialty chemicals.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverview Occidental Petroleum’s diversity is attractive to many shareholders including Buffett. The company is broken down into three segments: Oil &amp; Gas, Chemical, and Midstream &amp; Marketing.The Oil and Gas segment explores, develops, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL), condensate, and natural gas with both domestic and international operations. The Chemical segment manufactures and markets polyvinyl chloride resins, chlorine, and caustic soda in the U.S., Canada, and Chile. Lastly, the Midstream and Marketing segment encompasses operations that gather, treat, process, transport, store, trade, and market crude oil, natural gas, NGL, condensates, and carbon dioxide. Wall Street will be looking for further growth among the Chemical and Midstream Segments to show the company’s ability to separate itself as an elite player among integrated oil companies. Last quarter, OXY’s chemical segment income was $620 million, up 158% from Q2 2021, for the fourth consecutive quarter of record earnings. Occidental stated the increase was due to improved demand across most product lines. The Midstream and Marketing segment was also up at $247 million compared to a loss of -$3 million the prior year, driven by higher sulfur prices and sales volume. This helped the company beat earnings expectations by 8% at $3.16 per share.Story continuesInvestors will surely hope the growth and diversification of Occidental Petroleum continues along with the company’s core Oil and Gas business which saw income up a stellar 645% to $3 billion in Q2.Q3 OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for OXY’s Q3 earnings is $2.48 per share, which would represent a 185% increase from Q3 2021. However, earnings estimates for the period are significantly down from $2.78 at the beginning of the quarter. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 37% at $9.35 billion.Year over year, OXY earnings are now expected to rise 295% to $10.07, but dip -17% in FY23 at $8.29 per share after a tough-to-compete-with year. Sales are projected to be up 43% this year but decline -8% in FY23 at $34.76 billion. Occidental’s revenue is now well above its pre-covid levels, with 2019 sales at $20.91 billion.Performance &amp; Valuation Year to date OXY is up +162% to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -22% and its peer group’s +104%, which includes notable competitors Hess Corporation HES and ConocoPhillips COP. Taking a look at the stock’s post-pandemic performance, we can see OXY is up +522% to blast the benchmark when including its dividend in its total return. This is also near its peer group’s +549%.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $75 per share, OXY has a forward P/E of 7.2X. This is nicely below the industry average of 12.2X. Even better, OXY trades at a discount to its high of 19.4X earlier in the year and near the median of 7X. Plus, despite OXY’s impressive performance this year the stock trades well below the benchmark’s 17.2X. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLike other oil and energy stocks that have already beaten Q3 expectations, a strong report could be a nice catalyst for OXY and lead to a sustained rally. OXY currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While Occidental Petroleum is expected to see continued growth, earnings estimates have gone down from the beginning of the quarter.This makes an earnings beat even more significant for the stock along with the ability to show continued growth among its business segments. OXY offers investors a 0.71% annual dividend yield at $0.52 a share and long-term investors may be rewarded with the company in a top-rated industry and still appearing to trade at a discount despite oil prices remaining high.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.9%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderOccidental’s third-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from share repurchases initiated in the last quarter. The repayment of outstanding debts would reduce capital servicing cost and boost margins.Strong production from domestic assets may have given a boost to total production volumes in the quarter. However, lower sulfur prices are likely to have impacted the midstream business in the third quarter.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share and total revenues are pegged at $2.48 per share and $9.35 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 185% and 37.3%, respectively.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Occidental this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here, as you see below.

That generally means gridlock would reign in Washington, making it harder for President Joe Biden to push his agenda, which still includes social spending programs.Investors are also focused on Thursday’s inflation report, which is expected to show the consumer price index ticked lower from October last year, to 6.5% on a core basis, which excludes food and energy, and 8% overall. Last month, core CPI was 6.6%, while the headline number was 8.2%.Thursday also brings the latest report on weekly jobless claims.The Federal Reserve is closely following the data on inflation and the labor market as it decides which direction to take interest rates toward at its December meeting.

Allen III, recently plunked down nearly $2 million dollars to buy 33,200 shares on Oct. 28 at a price of approximately $60.18 per share, according to GuruFocus insider trade data.Allen is a member of the board of directors at Coca-Cola who was appointed in December 2021. In the past, Allen was the president of Allen &amp; Co., a privately held investment firm, for nearly two decades, so as a fellow investor, I believe he may be even more savvy than most insiders. Thus, let's take a look at Coca-Cola to see whether this insider is making a good call picking up shares of the company at the moment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with KO. Click here to check it out. KO 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KOPeter Lynch Chart of KOAbout the companyCoca-Cola is a multinational beverage company founded back in 1886 with products sold in more than 200 countries and territories. In fact, it is the biggest beverage company is the world. Its product portfolio of carbonated soft drink brands includes Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta. It also owns non-carbonated hydration, sports drinks, juice, coffee and tea brands, including Dasani, Smartwater, Powerade and Gold Peak. It also has licensing partnerships with some alcoholic brewers.Coca-Cola has a franchisor - franchisee business model wherein it owns the brand names and does all the brand building, product development and marketing and supplies the concentrate and flavours to its bottlers while the bottlers do the heavy lifting of manufacturing and distribution. Coca-Cola collects royalty payments, which are an undisclosed percentage of revenue from the bottlers. This makes for an asset light business as all the large capital investments in the bottling plants, inventory and transportation infrastructures are handled by the bottlers.A Life-Boat Called Coca-ColaSource: Coca-Cola investor relationsExcellent quarterly resultsThe company's most recent quarterly report for the third quarter of 2022 saw global unit case volume grow 4%, translating to revenue growth of 10% and operating income growth of 7%. On a comparable currency neutral basis, operating income grew 18%, showing that the strong dollar was a huge blow to international sales. The operating margin shrunk to 27.9% vs. 28.9% a year ago. Earnings per share grew 14% to $0.65 on a GAAP basis and 7% to $0.69 on a non-GAAP basis.Story continuesLooking at the long-term revenue and net income chart below, we can see that Coca-Cola is reviving after a period of weakness. This is a mature company in a slow growth industry, even though it is highly profitable.A Life-Boat Called Coca-ColaFinancial strengthWhile GuruFocus gives a middling 5 out of 10 score for the company's financial strength, in my opinion this is understated given the company's enormous and reliable cash flow. The company maintains an A+ bond rating in spite of its $35.5 billion long-term debt. The company's operating cash flow are depicted in the diagram below. Core free cash flow is around $9.7 billion. This huge and consistent cash flow gives the company better debt repayment certainty.A Life-Boat Called Coca-ColaShareholder focusCoca-Cola is an extremely shareholder-friendly company, sharing its wealth via both dividends and buybacks. The following diagram depicts the cumulative shareholder returns Coca-Cola has delivered to shareholders since 2006. The top green line show the market capitalization of the company, which has risen consistently at over a 6% CAGR. The purple area of the chart is the cumulative dividends paid out to common shareholders, the red area is the treasury shares the company has purchased (via stock buybacks) and the blue area is the money the company has retained. Adding cumulative dividends, stock buybacks and retained earnings gives us a good estimate of fundamental performance. Both dividends and buybacks are important part of Coca-Cola's total shareholder returns. Long-term fundamental returns using this method are consistently in the 7% CAGR range and this should continue into the future as Coca-Cola continues to penetrate deeper into growing emerging markets.A Life-Boat Called Coca-ColaValuationThe GF Value chart shows Coca-Cola to be fairly valued. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate from GuruFocus that uses the stock's historical price multiples, past returns and estimates of future business performance.A Life-Boat Called Coca-ColaThe company's price-earnings ratio and forward price-earnings ratio are 25.88 and 23.42, respectively, which implies a 9.5% growth rate in earnings per share in the current year. The Shiller price-earnings ratio is 30.23, which implies a current discount of 16.8%.The dividend yield is 2.97%. Coca-Cola has grown the dividend consistently in the past (at a CAGR of 6.1% over 10 years).ConclusionBeverage superpower Coca-Cola has performed much better than the S&amp;P 500 so far in the bear market which started early this year, as shown in the chart below. The company is considered recession-resistant by many as the demand for its products is not significantly impacted by an economic downturn.A Life-Boat Called Coca-ColaCoca-Colas third-quarter results and guidance reflect the companys reliable cash flows, pricing power and the resilience of its business model. Moreover, the companys consistent and growing dividends make it a kind of ""bond alternative"" and thus make it worth a premium price-earnings ratio in my opinion. If the bear market gets worse, I believe investors will be very happy with the lifeboat called Coca-Cola. Overall, I think the stock is between fairly valued to somewhat undervalued at the moment given the quality of the franchise.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

377,1f7e2fac-a8ef-34fe-8251-87513034cd46,WY,2022-11-08,The government wants to protect the habitat of a rare Louisiana snake that lays 5-inch-long eggs,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/government-wants-protect-habitat-rare-204248634.html,1667853768,STORY,['WY'],"[Four areas in Louisiana and two in Texas should be protected as critical habitat for a rare snake that eats pocket gophers and takes over the rodents' burrows, the federal government says.Louisiana pinesnakes, which produce the largest eggs and hatchlings of any U.S. snake, have been protected as threatened since 2018.Their decline is largely due to the drastic reduction and fragmentation of grassy longleaf pine savannas with sandy soil. And since Louisiana pinesnakes' 5-inch-long (12.7-centimeter) eggs are so big that they lay only three to five at a time, losses are hard to replace.The snakes grow to 5 feet long (1.5 meters) but are hard to count because they spend more than half their time underground. They also are camouflaged on brown pine needles, with black, brown and russet patches on a buff to yellowish background.National forests cover most of four areas that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed as critical habitat. Private land — including some covered by conservation agreements — comprises all of the smallest, in Texas, and virtually all of the biggest, in north Louisiana where the largest known population lives.Critical habitat is a limited protection, affecting only contracts using federal money or requiring federal permits. Other critical habitat decisions have sparked challenges by landowners and dissension over what lands qualify for such designation.In north Louisiana's Bienville Parish, private owners hold more than 99% of a proposed area about the size of Milwaukee — roughly 95 square miles (246 square kilometers). The smallest area, about 8 square miles (20 square kilometers) in Scrappin’ Valley, Texas, is all privately held.However, the Scrappin’ Valley land is already managed for endangered little red-cockaded woodpeckers, which also need open-canopied pine savannas, said Don Dietz, consulting biologist for a family that owns 70% of the land.Story continues“Red-cockaded woodpeckers eat a lot of ants, which need the open area below. So the habitat is essentially the same,” Dietz said.Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the environmental nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, said, “Far too few private landowners care about nature and ensuring species like the Louisiana pinesnake survive. When it does happen it's really great.""The Fish and Wildlife Service said two of seven known pinesnake populations are in Texas, but Dietz was dubious. He said he tried unsuccessfully for a decade to trap Louisiana pinesnakes to prove they lived in Scrappin' Valley.“I want to believe there’s some out there, but in Texas there may not be,” Dietz said.Other populations live in Louisiana's Bienville, Grant, Natchitoches, Sabine, and Vernon parishes, the federal agency said.Big Cypress State Park makes up about 0.5% of the proposed Bienville unit. Another 8.4 square miles (22 square kilometers) are part of a conservation agreement benefiting the snake, according to Fish and Wildlife's economic analysis.The Weyerhaeuser Co. announced in 2020 that it had a 30-year agreement to manage land in Bienville Parish for the Louisiana pinesnake.Weyerhaeuser said it is working to understand how the federal proposal “would overlap and potentially impact the acres of critical habitat we are currently protecting for the Louisiana pinesnake.”The company said in 2020 that state and federal biologists helped it identify two areas totaling about 2.8 square miles (7.25 square kilometers) as the most important for the snake. It said it would convert about 440 acres (180 hectares) from loblolly to longleaf pine and keep another 1,383 acres (560 hectares) with an open canopy and grassy forest floor.Wildlife and Fisheries wouldn’t say whether Weyerhaeuser's longleaf conversion and open canopy areas are within the proposed federal critical habitat.Wherever they are, it “isn’t really enough to help the Louisiana pinesnake on Weyerhaeuser land,"" Greenwald said. Louisiana pinesnake populations need blocks of more than 11 square miles (28.5 square kilometers) of mostly unfragmented habitat, according to the federal analysis.Also proposed as critical habitat in Louisiana are about 89 square miles (230 square kilometers) in Rapides Parish, more than 68 square miles (176 square kilometers) in Vernon Parish and about 41 square miles (106 square kilometers) in Grant Parish. Different parts of the Kisatchie National Forest make up most of each.The second Texas area would cover nearly 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) in Angelina and Jasper counties, mostly in the Angelina National Forest.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraElon Musk is facing trial again over his $56 billion Tesla paycheck that’s ‘the largest in human history’The winners of the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot will probably take it in cash.

If you want to see more of the best blue chip stocks to buy today, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.2022 has been a challenging year for many stocks in the market.Given the high inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year and many analysts think the central bank will raise the rate even further.With the higher interest rates, the U.S. consumer has less spending power and consumer demand is lower. With lower demand, companies are not investing as much, especially given that the cost of debt is also higher.Similarly, the rising interest rates have increased U.S. Treasury yields substantially and the higher Treasury yields have made stocks less attractive to some investors.As a result of the headwinds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 11.4% year to date while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 21.4% year to date. The NASDAQ has fallen the most, declining almost 34% year to date.Like the Dow Jones, many blue chip stocks have declined substantially in terms of their stock prices year to date. Given that many blue chip companies have strong competitive advantages and growth potential, however, some leading blue chips could be good buys in terms of long term investments as valuations potentially return closer to normal if the Federal Reserve successfully contains inflation.In the near term, however, there is uncertainty even for blue chips if economic data fails to meet expectations. Many analysts think there could be a recession next year and the Federal Reserve has signaled it isn't done raising rates.In addition to rising rates domestically, the international economy could face headwinds given that China's exports fell in October for the first time in over two years. With China's exports falling 0.3% in October in dollar terms year over year, global aggregate demand could be potentially weaker than expected.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that we think have upside in terms of the long term given their competitive advantages and growth potential. Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we ranked the 12 blue chips stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stocks at the end of Q2 2022.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today12. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is an industrial conglomerate whose shares declined in 2020 due to the pandemic, which weakened demand for GE aviation. With the interest rate increases and the broader market weakness, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) shares have declined again by slightly over 14% year to date in 2022. Nevertheless, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has quality businesses and quality earnings power that could give the stock upside in the long term.Longleaf Partners commented on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a blue chip stock that's owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Although Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is down around 2.57% year to date, the company's stock has done a lot better than the three major indexes as the leading retailer has benefited from more demand. Given the higher inflation, more consumers are looking for the best prices, and often Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stores are among the most competitive. If it can maintain its market share and keep its new customers, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) could continue to grow earnings for the future.10. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71As a maker of premium consumer staple brands, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been negatively affected by higher inflation. As a result, shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have declined by 17.8% year to date. Nevertheless, there's hope that the Federal Reserve will successfully win its battle against inflation in a year or two. If that happens, demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) premium brands could normalize again.9. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80Given the interest rate increases, the 30 year fixed mortgage rate is around 7.23% or more than double what it was a year ago. Given the higher mortgage rates, demand for homes has decreased, and demand for home improvement products has weakened too. As a result, leading home improvement retailer The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stock has fallen 31.6% year to date. Although interest rates could go higher before they go lower, there's hope the Federal Reserve will win its battle against inflation. If that happens, interest rates could normalize and demand for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) could normalize too. Currently shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) trade for a forward P/E ratio of 16.4, which could be an attractive valuation if the company grows EPS at the rate that analysts expect in the next five years.8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83 Although the broader market might have declined substantially in 2022, shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are up around 0.24% year to date. In the longer term, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is also in an uptrend as the company continues to grow earnings per share given its innovative products and the pricing power of its consumer brands. Currently shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) trade for a forward P/E of 16.5, which is pretty attractive given the company's competitive advantages and earnings power.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has benefited from the higher interest rates with higher net interest income, which rose 51% year over year in the third quarter. While JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s net interest income rose, the bank's net profit nevertheless fell 17% given it set aside $808 million in reserves. If there is a recession next year, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is among the best prepared banks given its balance sheet. In the long term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has upside given its quality earnings potential.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares are down 35.7% year to date given some of the company's businesses such as its theme parks are pretty economically sensitive. Disney+'s valuation has also decreased in 2022 given the decline of Netflix's valuation this year. Nevertheless, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has many high quality businesses that will likely increase in value in the long term if they maintain their market share.Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are blue chip stocks that are owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.Suggested articles:22 Biggest Economies in the World in 202215 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market CapDisclosure: None. 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
385,ad4d126c-79b1-341e-b6be-aceefd2202f3,GE,2022-11-08,General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) insiders have a reason to boast after seeing a US$431k addition to their US$5.7m investment,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-company-nyse-ge-140117544.html,1667829677,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) insiders who purchased shares in the last 12 months were richly rewarded last week. The stock climbed by 3.5% resulting in a US$3.0b addition to the company’s market value. As a result, their original purchase of US$5.7m worth of stock is now worth US$6.1m.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricThe Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$81.07. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the General Electric insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 75.54k shares for US$5.7m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by General Electric insiders. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does General Electric Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$217m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At General Electric Tell Us?The fact that there have been no General Electric insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, General Electric insiders feel good about the company's future. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in General Electric, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

386,f48b4852-3a8a-32a4-ba22-a9d57dce9a1c,GE,2022-11-08,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Honeywell International, General Electric and 3M Company",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-honeywell-114811978.html,1667821691,STORY,"['MMM', 'HON', 'GE', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 7, 2022 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Honeywell International HON, General Electric GE and 3M Company MMM.Industry: Diversified OperationsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2014047/3-diversified-operations-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-challengesThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry is plagued by persistent supply chain disruptions, which are weighing on volumes. High raw material costs are hurting the margins of industry players. Labor shortages remain a perennial problem for the industry. Amid growing recessionary fears, a slowdown in manufacturing activities adds to the worries in the industry.However, strength across end-markets is expected to support growth of Honeywell International, General Electric and 3M Company.About the IndustryThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end-markets, including oil &amp; gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction, and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines, and engineered fluid-process equipment.The industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. In addition, a few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets, and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Diversified Operations IndustrySupply Chain &amp; Cost Woes: Supply chain disruptions, especially those related to the shortage of semiconductor chips, are hurting the operations of industry players. Delay in the delivery of products is weighing on production volumes, thus impacting margins. The persistent shortage of labor and high raw material costs are added concerns for the industry, posing a threat to the bottom-line performance of companies. Pricing actions and cost-control measures are helping industry players tackle the adversities.Story continuesSlowdown in Manufacturing Activities: Amid growing inflation and persistent supply chain challenges, manufacturing activities are slowing down, indicating softness in customer demand. In October, the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index touched 50.2%, dipping 0.7 percentage point from the September reading. This was due to a decline in New Orders and New Export Orders Index.Amid growing uncertainty surrounding the economy, the demand environment is expected to remain volatile in the near term. Nevertheless, despite a slowdown, the manufacturing index remained above 50%, indicating continued expansion in manufacturing activities. This should help the industry participants stay afloat despite the slowdown in the manufacturing sector.Strength Across Various End-Markets: Although there is some softness in demand, with continued expansion in manufacturing activities, the industry is seeing sustained demand across its various end-markets, such as chemical and industrial pumps, commercial aerospace and defense, rail and electric vehicles. Companies with exposure to the life sciences vertical should benefit from robust activity in the bioprocessing business, and strength in instrument businesses, while those with exposure to the diagnostics vertical should gain from healthy demand for products related to respiratory testing. Companies offering construction materials are expected to benefit from the strengthening reroofing market in the United States, owing to new construction activity.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #168. This rank places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group’s 2022 earnings per share has decreased 9.5% over the past year.Despite the industry’s drab near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks that you may hold in your portfolios. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500Over the past year, the Zacks Diversified Operations has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index. The industry has declined 24% compared with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 22.5% decrease.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of EV/EBITDA (F12M), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing diversified operations stocks, the industry is currently trading at 9.35X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.77.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.32X, as low as 5.85X and at the median of 7.78X.3 Diversified Operations Stocks to Keep a Tab OnBelow we discuss three stocks from the diversified operations industry that are poised for growth despite challenges in the industry. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Honeywell: Based in Morris Township, NJ, Honeywell is a global diversified technology and manufacturing company, with a wide range of aerospace products and services.

The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.7%. The stock has gained 6.3% in the past three months.General Electric: Headquartered in Boston, MA, General Electric is a multinational conglomerate offering products and services, ranging from jet engines, airframes, energy production solutions to offshore wind turbines, technologies in medical imaging, and leasing and financing services.

It has amassed assets over $5.59 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.44%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Healthcare sector--about 25.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Unitedhealth Group Inc. (UNH) accounts for about 3.71% of total assets, followed by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B).The top 10 holdings account for about 26.18% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskMGV seeks to match the performance of the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Value Index before fees and expenses. The CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Value Index is a float-adjusted, market-capitalization-weighted index designed to measure equity market performance of mega-capitalization value stocks in the United States.The ETF has lost about -3.78% so far this year and is down about -0.84% in the last one year (as of 11/08/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $89.91 and $109.31.The ETF has a beta of 0.89 and standard deviation of 23.31% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 148 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesVanguard Mega Cap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, MGV is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $52.96 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $101.55 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

394,e5ff368c-7335-374d-af8d-3008feadcb58,PG,2022-11-08,The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Shares Could Be 24% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-nyse-pg-120131379.html,1667908891,STORY,['PG'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.5bUS$15.0bUS$16.2bUS$17.6bUS$18.5bUS$19.1bUS$19.7bUS$20.3bUS$20.8bUS$21.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.58%Est @ 3.1%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$12.7kUS$13.4kUS$13.6kUS$13.9kUS$13.8kUS$13.4kUS$13.1kUS$12.6kUS$12.2kUS$11.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$130bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$529bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$529b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$293bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$423b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$137, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Procter &amp; Gamble, there are three fundamental factors you should assess:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Procter &amp; Gamble .Future Earnings: How does PG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Launched on World Diabetes Day across 18 countries, the campaign raises awareness on Peripheral Neuropathy in diabetes, and the importance of early identification and timely treatment. SINGAPORE, Nov. 8, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of World Diabetes Day 2022, P&amp;G Health, announced it's 'Put Life Back in Your Hands' campaign being commemorated across 18 countries in Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, to raise public awareness on the connection between Peripheral Neuropathy and Diabetes, and the importance of early identification and timely treatment.With Diabetes Mellitus being the leading cause[2] of Peripheral Neuropathy (PN), the increasing prevalence of PN is closely linked to the rise in the number of diabetic patients. PN including Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is the result of damage to the nerves impacting quality of life of people as they are not able to go about their daily lives as comfortably. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include numbness, tingling, prickling, and burning sensations in the hands and feet. Besides diabetes mellitus, B vitamins deficiencies and aging are other high-risk factors leading to peripheral nerve damage.FAST FACTS:In 2021, there were 393 million diabetic patients[3] in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and African regions projected to rise to 603 million by 2045[3].With ~50%[1] of diabetic patients indicating that they suffer from Peripheral Neuropathy, there will be an exponential growth in the number of patients in these regions with PN.Less than one-third of physicians recognize signs of DPN. Undiagnosed cases contributing greatly to the high rates of morbidity and mortality of diabetes[3]. Up to 50 % of patients are asymptomatic and therefore often remain undiagnosed and are at risk of insensate injury[4].If not diagnosed and treated early, DPN can develop into neuropathic pain which has a tremendous impact on the quality of life.To decrease the risk of DPN, regular screening, early detection and patient education are crucial for optimal treatment outcomes.Story continuesAalok Agrawal, Senior Vice-President, P&amp;G Health, Asia, India, Middle East &amp; Africa said ""As a partner to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), P&amp;G Health is committed to continued efforts to raise awareness on Diabetes and its associated complications including Peripheral Neuropathy and Nerve Damage. Our 'Put Life Back in Your Hands' campaign is a large-scale collective awareness effort across 18 countries with consumers, healthcare professionals, pharmacists, medical and partner organisations to highlight the everyday challenges faced by people suffering from Peripheral Neuropathy, and the importance of timely diagnoses and treatment for an improved quality of life.""With conditions such as diabetes and peripheral neuropathy underdiagnosed and untreated in our region, platforms such as World Diabetes Day also provide an opportunity for collective efforts on raising awareness and education for improved treatment outcomes. One such effort is P&amp;G Health's 'Winning the Fight Against Neuropathy in Diabetic Patients' forum which will bring together globally renowned multidisciplinary medical experts with Healthcare Professionals and Pharmacists from across Asia-Pacific, Middle East, to share latest clinical guidance on diagnosing and treating diabetic nerve damage,"" he added.For more information on the 'Winning the Fight Against Neuropathy in Diabetic Patients' forum, please write in to our media contacts, or click here to register the webinar as healthcare professional: WDDglobalwebinar Disclaimer: Indications of Neurobion may differ in different countries, please check with your local healthcare professionals for more information.About P&amp;G Health:P&amp;G Health, the health care division of P&amp;G company, drives consumer-centric innovation to empower our consumers to live healthier, and more vibrant lives.

If you want to see more of the best blue chip stocks to buy today, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.2022 has been a challenging year for many stocks in the market.Given the high inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year and many analysts think the central bank will raise the rate even further.With the higher interest rates, the U.S. consumer has less spending power and consumer demand is lower. With lower demand, companies are not investing as much, especially given that the cost of debt is also higher.Similarly, the rising interest rates have increased U.S. Treasury yields substantially and the higher Treasury yields have made stocks less attractive to some investors.As a result of the headwinds, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 11.4% year to date while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 21.4% year to date. The NASDAQ has fallen the most, declining almost 34% year to date.Like the Dow Jones, many blue chip stocks have declined substantially in terms of their stock prices year to date. Given that many blue chip companies have strong competitive advantages and growth potential, however, some leading blue chips could be good buys in terms of long term investments as valuations potentially return closer to normal if the Federal Reserve successfully contains inflation.In the near term, however, there is uncertainty even for blue chips if economic data fails to meet expectations. Many analysts think there could be a recession next year and the Federal Reserve has signaled it isn't done raising rates.In addition to rising rates domestically, the international economy could face headwinds given that China's exports fell in October for the first time in over two years. With China's exports falling 0.3% in October in dollar terms year over year, global aggregate demand could be potentially weaker than expected.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that we think have upside in terms of the long term given their competitive advantages and growth potential.

Nevertheless, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has quality businesses and quality earnings power that could give the stock upside in the long term.Longleaf Partners commented on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a blue chip stock that's owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Although Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is down around 2.57% year to date, the company's stock has done a lot better than the three major indexes as the leading retailer has benefited from more demand. Given the higher inflation, more consumers are looking for the best prices, and often Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stores are among the most competitive. If it can maintain its market share and keep its new customers, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) could continue to grow earnings for the future.10. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71As a maker of premium consumer staple brands, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been negatively affected by higher inflation. As a result, shares of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have declined by 17.8% year to date. Nevertheless, there's hope that the Federal Reserve will successfully win its battle against inflation in a year or two. If that happens, demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) premium brands could normalize again.9. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80Given the interest rate increases, the 30 year fixed mortgage rate is around 7.23% or more than double what it was a year ago. Given the higher mortgage rates, demand for homes has decreased, and demand for home improvement products has weakened too. As a result, leading home improvement retailer The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stock has fallen 31.6% year to date. Although interest rates could go higher before they go lower, there's hope the Federal Reserve will win its battle against inflation. If that happens, interest rates could normalize and demand for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) could normalize too. Currently shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) trade for a forward P/E ratio of 16.4, which could be an attractive valuation if the company grows EPS at the rate that analysts expect in the next five years.8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83 Although the broader market might have declined substantially in 2022, shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are up around 0.24% year to date. In the longer term, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is also in an uptrend as the company continues to grow earnings per share given its innovative products and the pricing power of its consumer brands. Currently shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) trade for a forward P/E of 16.5, which is pretty attractive given the company's competitive advantages and earnings power.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has benefited from the higher interest rates with higher net interest income, which rose 51% year over year in the third quarter. While JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s net interest income rose, the bank's net profit nevertheless fell 17% given it set aside $808 million in reserves. If there is a recession next year, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is among the best prepared banks given its balance sheet. In the long term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has upside given its quality earnings potential.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares are down 35.7% year to date given some of the company's businesses such as its theme parks are pretty economically sensitive. Disney+'s valuation has also decreased in 2022 given the decline of Netflix's valuation this year. Nevertheless, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has many high quality businesses that will likely increase in value in the long term if they maintain their market share.Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are blue chip stocks that are owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today.Suggested articles:22 Biggest Economies in the World in 202215 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market CapDisclosure: None. 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Today is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

398,2be5fc04-a475-3e56-b25f-6bd2fdb7c9ae,UDR,2022-11-08,How Much Upside is Left in UDR (UDR)? Wall Street Analysts Think 44%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-udr-udr-145502267.html,1667832902,STORY,"['TGT', 'UDR']","[Shares of UDR (UDR) have gained 1.1% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $38.44, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $55.25 indicates a potential upside of 43.7%.The average comprises 16 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $48 to a high of $60, with a standard deviation of $3.59. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 24.9% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 56.1% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in UDR. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for UDRHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why UDR Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month, as two estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, UDR currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much UDR could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

DHI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2022) results on Nov 9, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% but revenues missed the same by 1.3%. Earnings and revenues of this homebuilding company grew 53% and 20.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.Markedly, D.R. Horton reported better-than-expected earnings in the last 14 quarters.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has moved south over the past 30 days to $5.09 from $5.22 per share. The estimated figure indicates a 317.6% increase from the year-ago earnings of $3.70 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $10.04 billion, suggesting a 23.8% year-over-year improvement.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseD.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseD.R. Horton, Inc. price-eps-surprise | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteFor the fiscal fourth quarter, D.R. Horton’s Homebuilding revenues are expected to have increased from the year-ago level, given continued demand amid supply-chain challenges. Also, lower lumber prices and a higher average price of settlements are helping this one of the country’s largest homebuilders.In addition, the company’s industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and affordable product offerings across multiple brands are expected to have aided revenues. DHI anticipates total revenues of $10-$10.8 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $9.60 billion suggests a 25.9% increase from a year ago.The same for Financial Services revenues of $246 million suggests a rise of 10.3% from the year-ago level of $223 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average selling price of homes closed is pegged at $396,000, suggesting growth from the year-ago level of $346,000.Yet, the U.S. housing market has been grappling with uncertainties arising from skyrocketing mortgage rates. This may have impacted DHI’s orders in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, higher land, labor and material costs are expected to reflect on fiscal fourth-quarter margins to some extent. The company has been witnessing significant supply-chain disruptions, including shortages and delayed delivery of certain building materials and a tight labor market. These may have created difficulties for DHI in fulfilling customer demand, thereby affecting deliveries.Story continuesOther ProjectionsDHI expects fiscal fourth-quarter homes closed within 23,500-25,500. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for homes closed is pegged at 24,186 units, suggesting growth of 10.3% from the year-ago period.DHI expects the home sales gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter to be within 29-29.8% range. DHI anticipates homebuilding SG&amp;A (as a percentage of revenues) for the fiscal fourth quarter to be 6.3%.Financial services pre-tax profit margin is expected to be lower than 20% due to the timing of revenues from interest rate commitments. The income tax rate is likely to be 24% for the fiscal fourth quarter.The consensus estimate for net sales orders is currently pegged at 13,739 units. This suggests a decrease from 15,949 units a year ago. The same for the backlog is currently pegged at 18,730 units, which suggests a decrease from 26,221 units a year ago. The consensus estimate for the value of the backlog is $7.72 billion, implying a decline from $9.46 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for D.R. Horton for the quarter to be reported. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: DHI has an Earnings ESP of -17.07%.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Sherwin-Williams (SHW) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SHW for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Sherwin-Williams' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Sherwin-Williams' main business drivers.Founded in 1866 and headquartered in Cleveland, OH, The Sherwin-Williams Company is into manufacturing and sales of paints, coatings and related products, primarily in the North and South America. It also has operations in the Caribbean region, Europe and Asia. Sherwin-Williams is one of the biggest paint companies in the United States and in the world. Its well-known brands include Dutch Boy, Minwax and Krylon. The company, on Jun 1, 2017, completed the purchase of rival paints maker Valspar in an all-cash transaction, creating a premier global paints and coatings company.Sherwin-Williams made changes to its reporting structure as a result of its acquisition of Valspar that led to the formation of three new reportable operating segments – The Americas Group, The Consumer Brands Group and The Performance Coatings Group. Earlier, the company had four operating segments – The Paint Stores Group, The Consumer Group, The Global Finishes Group and The Latin America Coatings Group.The Americas Group: This segment includes the company’s earlier Paint Stores Group and Latin America Coatings Group. The group produces and sells a wide array of industrial coatings, architectural paint and related products across Latin America through dedicated dealers and company-operated stores. The segment accounted for around 56% of Sherwin-Williams’ 2021 sales.Story continuesThe Consumer Brands Group: The division includes the company’s Consumer Group and Valspar's Consumer Paints segment, barring Valspar's Automotive Refinishes products business. The segment operates highly efficient supply chain for paints and coatings related products across the globe. The segment accounted for around 14% of Sherwin-Williams’ 2021 sales.The Performance Coatings Group: The unit includes the company’s Global Finishes Group and Valspar's Coatings Group coupled with Valspar's Automotive Refinishes products business. It sells a wide array of industrial coatings and finishes for industrial wood, general industrial, protective and marine, packaging and automotive, coil and extrusion customers. The segment accounted for around 30% of Sherwin-Williams’ 2021 sales.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Sherwin-Williams ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $4,568.27, or a 356.83% gain, as of November 7, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 166.62% and the price of gold went up -6.02% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for SHW.Sherwin-Williams’ adjusted earnings and sales for the third quarter beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company is expected to gain from the synergies of the Valspar acquisition and its operational- improvement actions. It is focused on growth through the expansion of operations. It is benefiting from strength in the Performance Coatings Group. Cost-control actions, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are also expected to support margins. However, supply-chain issues and higher labor costs are expected to hurt results in fourth-quarter 2022. The company also faces headwinds from higher input costs due to supply disruptions. It is exposed to challenges stemming from soft demand in Europe and China. A stretched valuation is another concern.Shares have gained 5.17% over the past four weeks and there have been 4 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(Corporate Services) operations generated $0.99 per share of GAAP EPS in the third quarter of 2022, which was $0.02 per share lower than the third quarter of 2021. The primary drivers of lower EPS were higher interest expense and timing of income tax expense.Non-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent operations generated $(0.11) per share of GAAP EPS in the third quarter of 2022, which was a $0.09 per share earnings decrease compared to the third quarter of 2021. The lower EPS was primarily driven by higher interest expense, timing of income taxes, and a non-GAAP charge related to the recently announced Iowa state income tax rate change.Story continuesEarnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2022 excludes $0.03 per share related to the Iowa state income tax rate change described above for Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.Estimated Net Temperature Impacts to Non-GAAP EPS - The estimated year-to-date impact of net temperatures on EPS compared to normal temperatures is a $0.07 per share gain in 2022. The midpoint of the temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2022 is $2.73.Details regarding GAAP EPS variances between the third quarters of 2022 and 2021 for Alliant Energy are as follows: VarianceHigher interest expense ($0.04)Timing of income tax expense (0.04)Iowa state income tax rate change (0.03)Other (0.01)Total ($0.12)Higher interest expense - Total long-term debt increased due to additional financings since September 30, 2021 largely to fund capital expenditures, including the solar expansion program in Wisconsin. In addition, increases in short-term debt interest rates during 2022 contributed to higher interest expense in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.Timing of income tax expense - Income tax expense is recorded each quarter based on an estimated annual effective tax rate and the proportion of full year earnings generated each quarter, which causes fluctuations in the amount of tax expense quarter-over-quarter. The $0.04 timing variance in the third quarter is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter.Iowa state income tax rate change - In September 2022, the Iowa Department of Revenues announced a change in the Iowa corporate income tax rate from 9.8% to 8.4%, effective January 1, 2023, in accordance with legislation enacted earlier this year. The announced change in the corporate income tax rate resulted in a non-GAAP charge of $8 million or $0.03 per share recorded in the third quarter to income tax expense related to the remeasurement of deferred income tax assets at the Non-utility and Parent operations. The lower tax rate also resulted in a reduction in regulatory assets recorded in the third quarter related to the remeasurement of deferred income tax liabilities at IPL which will provide cost benefits to its Iowa customers in the future.2022 Earnings GuidanceAlliant Energy is updating its EPS guidance for 2022 as follows. The midpoint of the 2022 EPS guidance was increased primarily due to the estimated temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales through the first three quarters of 2022. Revised PreviousAlliant Energy Consolidated$2.76 - $2.83 $2.67 - $2.81Drivers for Alliant Energy’s 2022 EPS guidance include, but are not limited to:Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of returnStable economy and resulting implications on utility salesNormal temperatures in its utility service territoriesExecution of cost controlsExecution of capital expenditure and financing plansConsolidated effective tax rate of 4%The 2022 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, future changes in laws including corporate tax reform in Iowa, regulations or regulatory policies, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances, changes in credit loss liabilities related to guarantees, pending lawsuits and disputes, settlement charges related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, impacts from changes to the authorized return on equity for the American Transmission Company, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.2023 Earnings GuidanceAlliant Energy is issuing EPS guidance for 2023 of $2.82 - $2.96.

Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including the sections therein titled “Risk Factors,” and its other filings with the SEC.Without limitation, the expectations with respect to 2022 and 2023 earnings guidance, 2023 annual common stock dividend target and 2022-2026 capital expenditures guidance in this press release are forward-looking statements and are based in part on certain assumptions made by Alliant Energy, some of which are referred to in the forward-looking statements. Alliant Energy cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions referred to in the forward-looking statements or otherwise are accurate or will prove to be correct. Any assumptions that are inaccurate or do not prove to be correct could have a material adverse effect on Alliant Energy’s ability to achieve the estimates or other targets included in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Alliant Energy undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include income and EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 excluding a charge related to the Iowa state income tax rate change. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it provides an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provides additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that will be reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our third quarter 2022 Form 10-Q.This press release also includes temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year ended December 31, 2022. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP guidance measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow and in the case of temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS guidance, in the press release above.Note: Unless otherwise noted, all “per share” references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATIONEARNINGS SUMMARY (Unaudited)The following tables

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders have enjoyed a 59% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 39% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 11% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, PepsiCo managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.4% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 10% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that PepsiCo has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of PepsiCo, it has a TSR of 84% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that PepsiCo shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 13% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for Union Pacific as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Union Pacific.Is There Enough Growth For Union Pacific?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Union Pacific's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 20%. As a result, it also grew EPS by 29% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 7.3% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.4% each year, which is noticeably more attractive.In light of this, it's alarming that Union Pacific's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesOur examination of Union Pacific's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Union Pacific that we have uncovered.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $343.2 million, suggesting an increase of 7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 7 cents per share. The company reported a loss of 21 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 26.4%.In the last reported quarter, Wix reported a non-GAAP loss of 14 cents per share.

Price and EPS SurpriseWix.com Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Wix.com Ltd. QuoteFactors to ConsiderWix’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong bookings growth and an improving user base. The company’s increasing focus on monetizing existing users is likely to have acted as a tailwind.Wix is expanding the subscriber base with product rollouts and enhancing the existing portfolio of services amid the pandemic-triggered accelerated digitalization. As of Jun 30, registered users were 234 million.Strengthening momentum across Wix’s Business Solutions, owing to the growing adoption of G-Suite and Wix Payments, is expected to have driven growth in the segment’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.In September 2022, the company rolled out its new Wix Portfolio, which enables professional users and students to customize and develop an online portfolio to showcase and grow their business. Wix Portfolio enables its customers to concentrate more on their vision instead of the web designing process. In July 2022, Wix launched Wix Editor, which integrates with the Wix Artificial Design Intelligence and the existing Wix Editor to provide users with simplified complex design capabilities. Users can now leverage the improved design possibilities to turn their web creation visions into realities. The healthy adoption of new products is likely to have driven the top-line performance in the third quarter.Also, Wix’s increasing traction among B2B businesses is likely to have driven its subscription growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Synergies from recent acquisitions of Modalyst, Rise, ai and SpeedETab are likely to have contributed to the top-line performance.The exit from Russia, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to have dented the company’s performance. Higher product development and marketing investments amid increasing competition from other cloud-based software and payment platforms are likely to have exerted pressure on the company’s margins in the third quarter. Focus on small and medium-sized businesses that have been hit hard by the pandemic is an added concern.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Wix this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.Wix has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.
