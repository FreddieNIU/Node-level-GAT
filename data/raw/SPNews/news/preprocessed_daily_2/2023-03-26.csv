The talks concern deals worth $1.4 billion, according to NOC's chairman who spoke to the Wall Street Journal.For decades, North Africa has been the source of much migrant trouble and some gas. It has been part of the ""jungle"" that that very same Josep Borrell referred to in a controversial speech that described Europe itself as a ""garden"" that needs to be protected from the ""jungle."" Until he discovered the jungle has oil and gas, it seems.Algeria sells more than 80 percent of its natural gas to Europe. It is already one of the continent's largest suppliers of the commodity. Yet analysts were quick to point out that Algeria can hardly replace Russian gas volumes.First, the country had limited production capacity, which later became obvious when its gas exports to Europe rose to a near record in 2021, only to slump by 10 percent in 2022, right when Europe was most thirsty for gas.Second, the country needs major investments in production expansion, and it cannot afford them on its own. So others are stepping in to supply that investment: the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Chevron was looking into gas exploration in Algeria, which happens to hold even bigger shale resources than the United States.Directing investments to such resource-abundant locations is a big positive, and Algeria would certainly welcome these, but the EU is putting obstacles in its own way. Last year, the bloc agreed on what effectively amounts to a price cap on the natural gas it buys from abroad. And Algeria was not happy about it.Story continuesRelated: Will Brent Break Below $70 This Year?A day after the EU announced the cap, Algerian energy minister Mohamed Arkad said Algeria ""doesn't support the idea of limiting prices,"" adding that ""Energy markets must stay free"" if investments in more production are to continue flowing.""Algeria is seen as a reliable and secure supplier to Europe and we are in full agreement with our European partners on long-term pricing,"" the Algerian official said, and his European counterparts will have to agree with him, one way or another.Meanwhile, in Libya, Italy's Eni and the National Oil Corporation recently sealed a deal worth $8 billion that Eni will invest in two offshore gas fields as Italy, like its parent organization, seeks to diversify its sources of energy.""Libya is clearly for us a strategic economic partner,"" Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said, even as the Libyan oil minister slammed the Eni deal as illegal and said NOC had not consulted his ministry with regard to it.The deal, by the way, has a 40-year duration and envisages boosting Libya's natural gas production to 800 million cu ft daily. In return for its investment, Eni will retain ownership over 38 percent of the gas it produces under the deal for a period of 15 years.The reaction of minister Mohamed Aoun is a reminder that Libya is not a politically stable country, and this could make for a challenging investment environment. Yet the truth that Europe has been made aware of over the past year or so is that it needs gas, and this gas has to come from somewhere.""North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,"" the president of a U.S.-based firm, North Africa Risk Consulting, told the WSJ. Yet, as Europe urgently looks for replacements for Russian energy, ""this is their moment,"" Geoff Porter also said.Algeria has an estimated 707 trillion cu ft of natural gas trapped in shale formations—the third-largest in the world after China's and Argentina's. Libya holds some 1.5 trillion cu m of natural gas, or around 53 trillion cu ft.These are certainly volumes worth the interest of companies the size and stature of Chevron, Eni, and Halliburton. Especially with European demand just having awoken and despite the EU leadership's insistence on reducing the bloc's dependence on hydrocarbons in short order.This insistence is certainly strong, and the EU has been busy drafting legislation to that effect in the past months. Yet now that it has realized it needs hydrocarbons to survive, Europe might be prepared to realize something else as well—that you cannot get countries to produce more gas for you without providing something in return.Italy has figured that out, hence the deal with Libya's NOC. The U.S. supermajors seem to have figured it out, too, and are making a North African bet. The chance of it proving a successful bet is quite decent. Europe already knows it cannot survive on U.S. LNG alone.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Standard Chartered Blames Gamma Hedging For Overdue Oil SelloffOil Prices Near $75 As Russia Extends Output Cut Through JuneBank Turmoil Could Undermine The Effect Of Biden’s Clean Energy BillRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Once the oil was marketed, “the corresponding payments were not made” to the state oil company.The attorney general’s statement comes five days after Venezuela’s once-powerful oil minister, Tareck El Aissami, resigned amid allegations of corruption against some of his closest associates.El Aissami said he resigned to “accompany and fully support” the investigations. For now, El Aissami, who was one of Maduro’s trusted ministers, is not facing charges.The U.S. government designated El Aissami a narcotics kingpin in 2017 in connection with activities in his previous positions as interior minister and governor. El Aissami's resignation was announced two days after the Public Ministry appointed five prosecutors to probe the alleged crimes investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Police.Among the 10 officials arrested, according to the attorney general, are Col. Antonio Pérez Suárez, the vice president of trade and quality supply at PDVSA; Hugbel Roa, the former minister of food; and Joselit Ramírez, the national superintendent of cryptocurrencies.Also arrested were 11 businessmen, who will be charged with appropriation or diversion of public assets, influence peddling, money laundering and criminal association, Saab said, adding that the crime of treason against the country will be added to public officials’ charges.Corruption has long been rampant in Venezuela, which sits atop the world’s largest petroleum reserves. But officials are rarely held accountable — a major irritant to citizens, the majority of whom live on $1.90 a day, the international benchmark of extreme poverty.]"

12,d91d66c8-800e-300a-be8d-0ffb0a533c0a,CRM,2023-03-26,Salesforce is shuttering Slack’s remote work research group Future Forum amid CEO Marc Benioff’s back-to-office push,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-shuttering-slack-remote-research-004925901.html,1679791765,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce-owned Slack is sunsetting Future Forum, a consortium that conducted quarterly surveys of 10,000 office workers globally on flexible and remote work, and repeatedly found it was popular with most workers. Among other things, it found that flexible work has a positive impact on productivity, fosters trust between employees and employers, and decreases employee turnover. This comes amid Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s push for workers to return to the office.On Friday, the executive leader of the Future Forum, Brian Elliot, wrote “there’s no easy way to say this” to employees in Slack’s internal #friends-of-future-forum channel, disclosing that the company planned to shut down the research group at the end of March, according to screenshots of the message seen by Fortune. He did not cite a reason for the closure, and a Slack spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.“I believe this is what's best for Slack,” Elliot wrote, adding that the company will continue its investment in research around the future of work, but did not describe details for what lies ahead for the consortium.At the launch of Future Forum in September 2020, Elliot wrote a blog post that outlined its mission, citing “the sudden move to remote work provides the opportunity to question decades of orthodoxy about a 9-to-5, office-centric, homogeneous work culture.”The decision to shutter the Future Forum comes after reports that Salesforce is mandating a return to the office for some employees at a manager's discretion—despite the benefits of flexible work that Future Forum found in its research.What’s more, Salesforce has executed a litany of cost-cutting measures: 10% of the company was laid off in January, an employee “gratitude” bonus was lowered by 40%, the board's M&amp;A committee was disbanded, and Benioff told staff he was looking to cut $3 billion to $5 billion in costs.“The Future Forum team has been critical to crafting our market position and helping companies envision a new, more productive way of working,” newly appointed Slack CEO Lidaine Jones wrote in the channel. “We remain committed to flexible, inclusive work at Slack and will carry forward your impactful work.”Story continuesBenioff’s turn against remote workThe changing of hands at Slack—Salesforce acquired it for $28 billion in 2021—has also meant a change in ideals. Slack’s co-founder and CEO of over a decade, Stewart Butterfield, has long advocated for flexible work for all employees, which he believes will be integral to business success going forward. (Butterfield unexpectedly announced in December that he would be leaving Slack.)“People do want structure, and people like boundaries,” Butterfield told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell two months earlier, in October. “But they don’t like to be told what to do, so I think the secret is to not make them feel like their autonomy is being denied or that their ideas aren’t important, while still giving some structure.”The same can’t be said for Benioff, at least not anymore. Last month, in a document outlining Salesforce’s obstacles, Benioff wrote that “wellness culture overpowered high performance culture” during pandemic-era remote work. And in December 2022, he wrote in the #all-salesforce Slack channel that employees hired during the pandemic had “much lower productivity.” He followed that by soliciting feedback: “Is this a reflection of our office policy? Are our managers not directly addressing productivity with their teams?”Earlier this month, on the On With Kara Swisher podcast, Benioff said he “knows empirically” that new hires perform better “if they’re in the office, meeting people, being onboarded, being trained.”“If they are at home and not going through that process, we don’t think they’re as successful,” he said.It was a big departure for Benioff from just last summer, when he criticized return-to-office mandates in general. They're ""never going to work,"" he said at the time.In a company town hall in January, Butterfield admitted he “wasn’t very successful” in integrating Slack’s culture with that of Salesforce, per an audio recording of the meeting Fortune obtained. “The problem has been, there’s no incorporation of the Slack culture into the Salesforce culture, and unless there is some element of that, then it’s not integration in any sense. It’s just the elimination.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

(NYSE:TJX) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.11bUS$3.20bUS$3.47bUS$4.26bUS$4.51bUS$5.29bUS$5.80bUS$6.24bUS$6.60bUS$6.91bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.73%Est @ 7.44%Est @ 5.83%Est @ 4.70% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.9kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$3.1kUS$3.0kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$114bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$114b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$52bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$81b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$74.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.041. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TJX CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The talks concern deals worth $1.4 billion, according to NOC's chairman who spoke to the Wall Street Journal.For decades, North Africa has been the source of much migrant trouble and some gas. It has been part of the ""jungle"" that that very same Josep Borrell referred to in a controversial speech that described Europe itself as a ""garden"" that needs to be protected from the ""jungle."" Until he discovered the jungle has oil and gas, it seems.Algeria sells more than 80 percent of its natural gas to Europe. It is already one of the continent's largest suppliers of the commodity. Yet analysts were quick to point out that Algeria can hardly replace Russian gas volumes.First, the country had limited production capacity, which later became obvious when its gas exports to Europe rose to a near record in 2021, only to slump by 10 percent in 2022, right when Europe was most thirsty for gas.Second, the country needs major investments in production expansion, and it cannot afford them on its own. So others are stepping in to supply that investment: the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Chevron was looking into gas exploration in Algeria, which happens to hold even bigger shale resources than the United States.Directing investments to such resource-abundant locations is a big positive, and Algeria would certainly welcome these, but the EU is putting obstacles in its own way. Last year, the bloc agreed on what effectively amounts to a price cap on the natural gas it buys from abroad. And Algeria was not happy about it.Story continuesRelated: Will Brent Break Below $70 This Year?A day after the EU announced the cap, Algerian energy minister Mohamed Arkad said Algeria ""doesn't support the idea of limiting prices,"" adding that ""Energy markets must stay free"" if investments in more production are to continue flowing.""Algeria is seen as a reliable and secure supplier to Europe and we are in full agreement with our European partners on long-term pricing,"" the Algerian official said, and his European counterparts will have to agree with him, one way or another.Meanwhile, in Libya, Italy's Eni and the National Oil Corporation recently sealed a deal worth $8 billion that Eni will invest in two offshore gas fields as Italy, like its parent organization, seeks to diversify its sources of energy.""Libya is clearly for us a strategic economic partner,"" Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said, even as the Libyan oil minister slammed the Eni deal as illegal and said NOC had not consulted his ministry with regard to it.The deal, by the way, has a 40-year duration and envisages boosting Libya's natural gas production to 800 million cu ft daily. In return for its investment, Eni will retain ownership over 38 percent of the gas it produces under the deal for a period of 15 years.The reaction of minister Mohamed Aoun is a reminder that Libya is not a politically stable country, and this could make for a challenging investment environment. Yet the truth that Europe has been made aware of over the past year or so is that it needs gas, and this gas has to come from somewhere.""North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,"" the president of a U.S.-based firm, North Africa Risk Consulting, told the WSJ. Yet, as Europe urgently looks for replacements for Russian energy, ""this is their moment,"" Geoff Porter also said.Algeria has an estimated 707 trillion cu ft of natural gas trapped in shale formations—the third-largest in the world after China's and Argentina's. Libya holds some 1.5 trillion cu m of natural gas, or around 53 trillion cu ft.These are certainly volumes worth the interest of companies the size and stature of Chevron, Eni, and Halliburton. Especially with European demand just having awoken and despite the EU leadership's insistence on reducing the bloc's dependence on hydrocarbons in short order.This insistence is certainly strong, and the EU has been busy drafting legislation to that effect in the past months. Yet now that it has realized it needs hydrocarbons to survive, Europe might be prepared to realize something else as well—that you cannot get countries to produce more gas for you without providing something in return.Italy has figured that out, hence the deal with Libya's NOC. The U.S. supermajors seem to have figured it out, too, and are making a North African bet. The chance of it proving a successful bet is quite decent. Europe already knows it cannot survive on U.S. LNG alone.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Standard Chartered Blames Gamma Hedging For Overdue Oil SelloffOil Prices Near $75 As Russia Extends Output Cut Through JuneBank Turmoil Could Undermine The Effect Of Biden’s Clean Energy BillRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Once the oil was marketed, “the corresponding payments were not made” to the state oil company.The attorney general’s statement comes five days after Venezuela’s once-powerful oil minister, Tareck El Aissami, resigned amid allegations of corruption against some of his closest associates.El Aissami said he resigned to “accompany and fully support” the investigations. For now, El Aissami, who was one of Maduro’s trusted ministers, is not facing charges.The U.S. government designated El Aissami a narcotics kingpin in 2017 in connection with activities in his previous positions as interior minister and governor. El Aissami's resignation was announced two days after the Public Ministry appointed five prosecutors to probe the alleged crimes investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Police.Among the 10 officials arrested, according to the attorney general, are Col. Antonio Pérez Suárez, the vice president of trade and quality supply at PDVSA; Hugbel Roa, the former minister of food; and Joselit Ramírez, the national superintendent of cryptocurrencies.Also arrested were 11 businessmen, who will be charged with appropriation or diversion of public assets, influence peddling, money laundering and criminal association, Saab said, adding that the crime of treason against the country will be added to public officials’ charges.Corruption has long been rampant in Venezuela, which sits atop the world’s largest petroleum reserves. But officials are rarely held accountable — a major irritant to citizens, the majority of whom live on $1.90 a day, the international benchmark of extreme poverty.]"

The town's water tower lay twisted on the ground.Michael Searcy, a storm chaser who saw the tornado approach Rolling Fork, spent hours helping to rescue trapped people.""As soon as we would go from one vehicle to the next vehicle or from building to building, we could hear screams and we could hear cries for help,"" he told Reuters. ""And we were just basically in small groups, digging through the rubble, trying to find and extricate people.""Members of one family narrowly escaped by taking shelter in a bathroom; the rest of the house collapsed around them, and the high winds dropped a van on top of the home, Searcy said.In Silver City, a rural community of around 300, residents described locking themselves in interior rooms and cowering inside bathtubs as the tornado swept through.""I thought about God,"" said Katherine Ray. ""I just started saying, 'I followed the Ten Commandments, Lord, it's just me at the house,' and I just said, 'Just take care of me.'""Her prayer was answered, she said; her trailer was damaged but still standing, while many of her neighbors saw their trailers completely destroyed.Story continuesGovernor Tate Reeves, who visited Silver City on Saturday, declared a state of emergency in the affected areas.""The scale of the damage and loss is evident everywhere affected today,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Homes, businesses ... entire communities.""In Alabama, which was also struck by the same storm system, rescuers pulled a man from the mud when his trailer was overturned, but the man later died from his injuries, according to the Morgan County Sheriff's Office. That appeared to be the only reported death in that state as of Saturday evening.U.S. President Joe Biden described the images from Mississippi as ""heartbreaking"" and said in a statement that he had spoken with Reeves and offered his condolences and full federal support for the recovery.""To those impacted by these devastating storms, and to the first responders and emergency personnel working to help their fellow Americans, we will do everything we can to help,"" Biden said.

The talks concern deals worth $1.4 billion, according to NOC's chairman who spoke to the Wall Street Journal.For decades, North Africa has been the source of much migrant trouble and some gas. It has been part of the ""jungle"" that that very same Josep Borrell referred to in a controversial speech that described Europe itself as a ""garden"" that needs to be protected from the ""jungle."" Until he discovered the jungle has oil and gas, it seems.Algeria sells more than 80 percent of its natural gas to Europe. It is already one of the continent's largest suppliers of the commodity. Yet analysts were quick to point out that Algeria can hardly replace Russian gas volumes.First, the country had limited production capacity, which later became obvious when its gas exports to Europe rose to a near record in 2021, only to slump by 10 percent in 2022, right when Europe was most thirsty for gas.Second, the country needs major investments in production expansion, and it cannot afford them on its own. So others are stepping in to supply that investment: the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Chevron was looking into gas exploration in Algeria, which happens to hold even bigger shale resources than the United States.Directing investments to such resource-abundant locations is a big positive, and Algeria would certainly welcome these, but the EU is putting obstacles in its own way. Last year, the bloc agreed on what effectively amounts to a price cap on the natural gas it buys from abroad. And Algeria was not happy about it.Story continuesRelated: Will Brent Break Below $70 This Year?A day after the EU announced the cap, Algerian energy minister Mohamed Arkad said Algeria ""doesn't support the idea of limiting prices,"" adding that ""Energy markets must stay free"" if investments in more production are to continue flowing.""Algeria is seen as a reliable and secure supplier to Europe and we are in full agreement with our European partners on long-term pricing,"" the Algerian official said, and his European counterparts will have to agree with him, one way or another.Meanwhile, in Libya, Italy's Eni and the National Oil Corporation recently sealed a deal worth $8 billion that Eni will invest in two offshore gas fields as Italy, like its parent organization, seeks to diversify its sources of energy.""Libya is clearly for us a strategic economic partner,"" Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said, even as the Libyan oil minister slammed the Eni deal as illegal and said NOC had not consulted his ministry with regard to it.The deal, by the way, has a 40-year duration and envisages boosting Libya's natural gas production to 800 million cu ft daily. In return for its investment, Eni will retain ownership over 38 percent of the gas it produces under the deal for a period of 15 years.The reaction of minister Mohamed Aoun is a reminder that Libya is not a politically stable country, and this could make for a challenging investment environment. Yet the truth that Europe has been made aware of over the past year or so is that it needs gas, and this gas has to come from somewhere.""North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,"" the president of a U.S.-based firm, North Africa Risk Consulting, told the WSJ. Yet, as Europe urgently looks for replacements for Russian energy, ""this is their moment,"" Geoff Porter also said.Algeria has an estimated 707 trillion cu ft of natural gas trapped in shale formations—the third-largest in the world after China's and Argentina's. Libya holds some 1.5 trillion cu m of natural gas, or around 53 trillion cu ft.These are certainly volumes worth the interest of companies the size and stature of Chevron, Eni, and Halliburton. Especially with European demand just having awoken and despite the EU leadership's insistence on reducing the bloc's dependence on hydrocarbons in short order.This insistence is certainly strong, and the EU has been busy drafting legislation to that effect in the past months. Yet now that it has realized it needs hydrocarbons to survive, Europe might be prepared to realize something else as well—that you cannot get countries to produce more gas for you without providing something in return.Italy has figured that out, hence the deal with Libya's NOC. The U.S. supermajors seem to have figured it out, too, and are making a North African bet. The chance of it proving a successful bet is quite decent. Europe already knows it cannot survive on U.S. LNG alone.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Standard Chartered Blames Gamma Hedging For Overdue Oil SelloffOil Prices Near $75 As Russia Extends Output Cut Through JuneBank Turmoil Could Undermine The Effect Of Biden’s Clean Energy BillRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Once the oil was marketed, “the corresponding payments were not made” to the state oil company.The attorney general’s statement comes five days after Venezuela’s once-powerful oil minister, Tareck El Aissami, resigned amid allegations of corruption against some of his closest associates.El Aissami said he resigned to “accompany and fully support” the investigations. For now, El Aissami, who was one of Maduro’s trusted ministers, is not facing charges.The U.S. government designated El Aissami a narcotics kingpin in 2017 in connection with activities in his previous positions as interior minister and governor. El Aissami's resignation was announced two days after the Public Ministry appointed five prosecutors to probe the alleged crimes investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Police.Among the 10 officials arrested, according to the attorney general, are Col. Antonio Pérez Suárez, the vice president of trade and quality supply at PDVSA; Hugbel Roa, the former minister of food; and Joselit Ramírez, the national superintendent of cryptocurrencies.Also arrested were 11 businessmen, who will be charged with appropriation or diversion of public assets, influence peddling, money laundering and criminal association, Saab said, adding that the crime of treason against the country will be added to public officials’ charges.Corruption has long been rampant in Venezuela, which sits atop the world’s largest petroleum reserves. But officials are rarely held accountable — a major irritant to citizens, the majority of whom live on $1.90 a day, the international benchmark of extreme poverty.]"

The town's water tower lay twisted on the ground.Michael Searcy, a storm chaser who saw the tornado approach Rolling Fork, spent hours helping to rescue trapped people.""As soon as we would go from one vehicle to the next vehicle or from building to building, we could hear screams and we could hear cries for help,"" he told Reuters. ""And we were just basically in small groups, digging through the rubble, trying to find and extricate people.""Members of one family narrowly escaped by taking shelter in a bathroom; the rest of the house collapsed around them, and the high winds dropped a van on top of the home, Searcy said.In Silver City, a rural community of around 300, residents described locking themselves in interior rooms and cowering inside bathtubs as the tornado swept through.""I thought about God,"" said Katherine Ray. ""I just started saying, 'I followed the Ten Commandments, Lord, it's just me at the house,' and I just said, 'Just take care of me.'""Her prayer was answered, she said; her trailer was damaged but still standing, while many of her neighbors saw their trailers completely destroyed.Story continuesGovernor Tate Reeves, who visited Silver City on Saturday, declared a state of emergency in the affected areas.""The scale of the damage and loss is evident everywhere affected today,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Homes, businesses ... entire communities.""In Alabama, which was also struck by the same storm system, rescuers pulled a man from the mud when his trailer was overturned, but the man later died from his injuries, according to the Morgan County Sheriff's Office. That appeared to be the only reported death in that state as of Saturday evening.U.S. President Joe Biden described the images from Mississippi as ""heartbreaking"" and said in a statement that he had spoken with Reeves and offered his condolences and full federal support for the recovery.""To those impacted by these devastating storms, and to the first responders and emergency personnel working to help their fellow Americans, we will do everything we can to help,"" Biden said.

We will work together to deliver the support you need to recover.""Mississippi officials set up three emergency shelters, including at the National Guard Armory in Rolling Fork. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director Deanne Criswell will travel to Mississippi on Sunday, the White House said.Parts of Mississippi and Alabama could face damaging winds, hail and possible tornados again on Sunday, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said.About 26,000 customers remained without power as of Saturday evening in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee due to the storm, according to the website PowerOutage.us.'MY CITY IS GONE'Mississippi's emergency management agency said on Saturday afternoon that the death toll had risen to 25, with dozens more injured. Four people who had been reported missing earlier have been located, the agency said.At least 12 of those deaths occurred in Rolling Fork, its mayor, Eldridge Walker, told CNN earlier in the day. The city is 75% Black, and about one-fifth of the population lives below the federal poverty line, according to U.S. Census data.""My city is gone, but we are resilient,"" Walker said on CNN. ""We are going to come back strong.""Jarrett Brown, a volunteer with the disaster response organization Team Rubicon who traveled to Rolling Fork, told Reuters the damage showed that the storm was inescapable for some residents.""In some of these areas, there was no safe spot to go to,"" he said via a video call.Tim and Tracy Harden, owners of Chuck's Dairy Barn in Rolling Fork, said in a Facebook post that they hid inside a small walk-in cooler one minute before the tornado demolished their building.""Forever grateful to the customer with the broken arm that kept going and freed us all from the cooler,"" they wrote.The National Weather Service in Jackson has deployed teams to assess the damage and determine whether additional tornados touched down, according to Price, the meteorologist.At least 24 reports of tornadoes, stretching from western Mississippi into Alabama, were issued to the National Weather Service on Friday night and into Saturday morning by storm chasers and observers.(Reporting by Aleksandra Michalska in Silver City, Mississippi; Arlene Eiras and Lucia Mutikani in Washington; Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; and Joseph Ax in New York.

""There's a perceived safety around moving those assets. Now, whether it's real or not, I think we'll find out. But I do think that there is this perceived safety of moving up in terms of those larger banks and deposits to those larger banks.""While regional banks such as First Republic (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW) battle declining deposits, their larger counterparts such as JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) have seen deposits surge.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Bank stocks have taken a hit across the board, but large national bank stocks have remained relatively resilient compared to regional bank stocks, which continue to suffer the brunt of the selling.Over the last month, JPMorgan stock fell 6.6%, Citigroup dropped 10.9%, and Wells Fargo declined by 17.5% as investors remained jittery over liquidity concerns.At the same time, First Republic Bank stock plunged 86.7% while regional banks Zions Bancorp (ZION), PacWest, and Western Alliance (WAL) suffered declines of 35.7%, 59.9%, and 51.3%, respectively, amid contagion fears.'We're really at a crossroads here in the banking industry'The favorability of large banks in some ways echoes the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, with 11 of the nation's largest banks swooping in to stabilize First Republic with a $30 billion cash infusion. In 2008, it was JPMorgan Chase’s purchase of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual that helped the investment bank become the powerhouse it is today.Story continuesExperts say that the recent crises will likely change the banking landscape yet again.""The current shake-up has created a lot of doubts about small and regional banks, and it would be a tragedy if those banks went away,"" Tassat CEO Kevin Greene said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live.Greene cautioned that the U.S. could move toward a model of banking similar to European system, which has fewer institutions among other differences, saying that model ""has been proven not to be good in terms of productivity, economic growth, and innovation.""Greene also stressed that the number of small- and medium-sized banks that are operating across the U.S. near small businesses and borrowers are ""the strength of the U.S. economy"" and should be preserved.""We're really at a crossroads here in the banking industry,"" Greene said, raising the question: ""Is our model for the future increasing dominance by a handful of banks?""Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of bank JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., pauses as he speaks during an interview in Miami, February 8, 2023.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Among the American attendees were Cristiano Amon, president and CEO of Qualcomm, Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, and Ray Dalio, founder of the world's biggest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, according to a photo in the statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry.Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang with a delegation of US business executives in Beijing on Saturday.

Photo: Xinhua&gt;Qin said that China will ensure its major policies are stable and continuous, and he added that China will open even wider to the outside world as the Chinese economy and society usher in a ""strong recovery"".All of this will benefit the American business community, Qin said, even though ""regrettably, the current China-US relationship remains as chilly in the early spring.""Qin said that China's stance on bilateral relations has not changed. ""China has always advocated for mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation between China and the US.""Story continuesQin called on Washington to stop trying to contain China and to work with China to return the world's two largest economies, which have been enmeshed in an array of issues, to a healthy track. In an uncommon move earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping directly accused the US of leading other Western nations to suppress China's development.During the meeting with Qin, the US business representatives said that ""the US and China are interdependent, and their relationship is currently at a critical juncture"", according to the Chinese readout.They told Chinese officials that the American business community ""is committed to preventing the two countries from falling into a cycle of mutual isolation and conflict"".To avoid such a conflict, the US delegation recommended greater face-to-face contact, more flights between the two countries, and deeper economic, trade and investment cooperation.Xie Feng, a vice foreign minister who is expected to be Beijing's next ambassador to Washington, also joined the conference.Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, was one of the American executives at Saturday's meeting in Beijing. Photo: EPA-EFE alt=Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, was one of the American executives at Saturday's meeting in Beijing. Photo: EPA-EFE&gt;On Tuesday, Xie met with William Zarit, a senior counsellor at the Cohen Group, and expressed the hope that the company will ""make more contributions to the steady development of China-US relations"".The US executives were in Beijing to attend the China Development Forum, an annual government-back conference to promote policy exchange with foreign business communities after the Two Sessions.Apple CEO Tim Cook, in remarks at the high-profile forum, gave a show of support for China as a market and manufacturing base amid a fierce hi-tech war between the two powers.""Apple and China grew together,"" Cook said. ""This has been a symbiotic kind of relationship that I think we both enjoyed,"" he said.However, global investors were also rattled by reports that the Chinese offices of New York-based Mintz Group, a due diligence firm, were raided and its Chinese staff detained days before the arrival of Cook and Dalio of Bridgewater Associates.Saturday's meeting came as US-China ties have cratered. Washington is threatening to ban the Chinese video app TikTok, to impose export restrictions on high-end semiconductors and chip-making equipment, to step up military activity in the Indo-Pacific region and to limit US investment in Chinese tech ventures.Before meeting Chinese senior diplomats, Allen of the business council and Bourla of Pfizer also met Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Friday.Wang also said China will ""unswervingly"" expand opening-up, provide better services and environments for foreign firms and strive to create stable expectations for the cooperation between enterprises of the two countries.Apple CEO Tim Cook was also in Beijing this weekend to attend the China Development Forum. Photo: Reuters alt=Apple CEO Tim Cook was also in Beijing this weekend to attend the China Development Forum. Photo: Reuters&gt;Allen and representatives of US-funded enterprises said ""they will continue their commitment to long-term development in China"", according to the statement of the commerce ministry.Bourla and Wang exchanged views on Pfizer's investments and operations in China and cooperation between the two countries' pharmaceutical industries.Foreign direct investment in China rose 1 per cent from a year earlier in the January-February period to US$39.7 billion after an 8 per cent growth throughout 2022 to US$189.1 billion, according to data from China's commerce ministry.But the balance of payment figures showed that foreign direct investment in China fell to the lowest level in 18 years during the second half of last year, warned Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digits, a digital technology company.""In the medium and long term, the relocation of industrial chains has become a major trend under great power competition. Western countries have a clear strategy of 'de-Sinicization' in their industrial chains,"" he wrote in an article published by the Financial Times on Tuesday, adding China should attach great importance to preventing the risks entailed.Additional reporting by Mark MagnierThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

What exactly does that entail, though? For one thing, the underlying sector – especially the hydrocarbon arena – will command long-term relevance. While the ideological winds seek to replace fossil fuels, renewable sources often lack the energy density required to compete effectively.The other component that makes the below energy stocks exceptionally compelling is that they hit the sweet spot of being undervalued (by objective standards) but highly rated among Wall Street analysts. Further, it’s not just about the baseline assessment itself. Rather, each of the names below commands an average price target that implies double-digit reward potential.PBFPBF Energy$43.02MPCMarathon Petroleum$126.98VLOValero Energy$131.77MGYMagnolia Oil &amp; Gas$20.68DVNDevon Energy$47.76ARCHArch Resources$130.00EPMEvolution Petroleum$5.81InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPBF Energy (PBF)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, and lubricants (among many other products), PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) deserves special consideration as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. With social normalization trends likely to increase traffic volume on our roadways, PBF offers an opportunity to profit. Indeed, since the January opener, PBG gained over 12% of its equity value.Financially, the company isn’t perfect but it holds its own. For instance, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 5.08, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, PBF’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.61 times, favorably below the industry median of 1.67 times.Operationally, the refiner posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, ranked better than 79.48% of the oil and gas sector. Most importantly regarding this topic of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices PBF at a forward multiple of 4.94. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 71.07% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PBG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.44, implying over 22% upside potential.Story continuesMarathon Petroleum (MPC)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is one of the larger players in its field. At the moment, the company carries a market capitalization of nearly $56 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MPC returned shareholders almost 14%. In the past 365 days, it moved up 58%. Still, it technically ranks as one of the underrated energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot.Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.42. As a discount to earnings, Marathon Petroleum ranks better than 68.76% of sector rivals. In addition, MPC trades at 0.36 times sales. However, the sector median value, in this case, is 0.93 times.Notably, Marathon carries an Altman Z-Score of just under 4, indicating an enterprise safe from bankruptcy. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA pings at 1.12 times, below the sector median of 1.67 times. Moreover, Marathon’s a growth machine, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.1%. Lastly, covering analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy.

As well, it covers other petrochemical products and power. Because of the ongoing social normalization trends, VLO easily represents one of the more relevant energy stocks. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained over 7% of equity value. In the past 365 days, they’re up nearly 37%.Even with the tremendous upside, VLO technically remains underrated. For instance, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.43. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than 68.61% of its peers. Also, VLO trades at a sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company beats out 80.23% of the industry.Further, Valero enjoys a robust balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.55. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, outpacing 76% of competitors. In closing, analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy (with one sell rating).

Since the beginning of this year, MGY fell over 7%. In the past 365 days, it gave up nearly 15% of its equity value. Still, the exploration and production (upstream) company could be an intriguing idea to consider, especially if you like to gamble.First, Magnolia enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio comes in at 1.73 times, outbidding 65.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.61, which ranks better than nearly 66% of the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.9%, while its net margin is nearly 53%. Both stats rank well into the industry’s upper half.Regarding valuation, the market prices MGY at a trailing multiple of 4.36. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) is 4.64 times, below the industry median of 7.3 times. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MGY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $29.67, implying nearly 45% upside potential.Devon Energy (DVN)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFocused on hydrocarbon exploration, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) commands a relevant profile among energy stocks. Unfortunately, DVN failed to resonate with investors so far this year. Since the Jan. opener, DVN gave up a worrying 19% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s off the mark by 23.5%. Nevertheless, for those that want to live a bit dangerously, DVN offers something to think about.Despite its market losses, Devon enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. Notably, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.65 times ranks better than 73.15% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 3.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.7% and a net margin of 31.38%. Both stats rank well in the upper half of the hydrocarbon sector.Most importantly for our discussion of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices DVN at a forward multiple of 5.75. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60.69% of its rivals. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DVN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target currently stands at $68.75, implying over 46% upside potential.Arch Resources (ARCH)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA coal mining and processing firm, Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the U.S. Per its public profile, Arch is the second-largest supplier of coal in the nation. Despite its relevancies, since the beginning of this year, ARCH slipped over 2%. In the trailing year, it’s down 13%.Nevertheless, for contrarian investors, ARCH may be one of the energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. Presently, the market prices ARCH at a trailing multiple of 2.04. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 83.67% of sector players. Also, its price-to-FCF comes in at 2.65 times. Here, the applicable discount for Arch ranks better than 69.47% of the industry.Beyond the valuation, Arch benefits from a solid balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.43. Also, the coal firm’s three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at 41%, above 74.15% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ARCH as a unanimous strong buy.

Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20%.Still, for the contrarian investor, EPM could also rank among the underappreciated energy stocks to buy. Financially, Evolution benefits from excellent strengths in the balance sheet. In particular, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 17.84 times, above 77.23% of the industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 5.51 indicates a low risk of bankruptcy.Regarding the theme at hand, the market prices EPM at a trailing multiple of 4.51.

In other words, many entities will buy stocks within a “hot” category for six months to a year. Then they will rapidly sell the same equities as the Street becomes less enamored with the sector.In just the last two years, SPAC stocks, electric-vehicle stocks, housing stocks, solar stocks, and metaverse stocks have gone through this type of “boom-and-bust” cycle. Therefore, with AI stocks currently in a “boom” phase, it’s crucial to identify large-cap AI stocks to avoid before the sector inevitably reaches the “bust” portion of the cycle.Of course, unprofitable companies with very high valuations and companies facing tough competition will be particularly vulnerable to the looming downturn of AI stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn light of those points, here are seven large-cap AI stocks to avoid like the plague.Meta (META)Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. MetaverseSource: MR Neon / ShutterstockShunned by the Street for the last two years, Meta (NASDAQ:META) has recently become a Street darling thanks to its embrace of AI, its decision to, despite its name, radically cut its spending on the metaverse and the possibility that one of its key competitors, TikTok, will be banned in the U.S.But, as I explained in the introduction to this column, the Street, following its usual pattern, will certainly become less thrilled by AI within six months to a year from now.And while Meta’s spending cuts are pleasing investors for now, that sugar high is unlikely to last as investors realize that Facebook’s owner is still grappling with tough competition for users from Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and TikTok, while it’s continuing to fight powerful competitors, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), for ad dollars. Moreover, as I’ve noted, I don’t expect the metaverse, which has been around for over 20 years and has not captured many adult users during all those years, to ever come close to meeting the elevated expectations of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Story continuesAs far as TikTok is concerned, I would be very surprised if Washington, ahead of a very important election in 2024, decides to ban TikTok, which has become extremely popular with many young Americans.Palantir (PLTR)Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.Source: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.comPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) does widely use AI. However, I have long maintained that I do not see evidence that Palantir’s AI tools are superior to its competitors. While researching this column, I saw no evidence that this situation has changed.Moreover, some data points from the company’s fourth-quarter results indicate that, despite businesses and governments’ increased embrace of AI in recent months, Palantir’s growth is slowing a great deal.For example, in Q4, the company’s U.S. revenue increased just 1.7% versus the previous quarter to $302 million. And its overall top-line growth slowed to 18% year-over-year in Q4, down from 22% in Q3.During its Q4 earnings call, Palantir’s executives sounded very excited that, after nearly 20 years of existence, the company generated its first quarterly profit, as it reported a Q4 net income of $31 million or 1 cent per share.However, its operations still generated an $18 million loss, with its operating margin at a discouraging -4%. Its shallow margin proves that the company’s AI technology is nothing special. That’s because if Palantir’s technology was very advanced, it could charge high prices to increase its operating margins to more impressive levels.Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.Source: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.comWith Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) saying that it’s “testing an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot internally,” some investors might see the Chinese e-commerce giant as an attractive AI play.But BABA’s fourth-quarter results indicate that its two largest businesses by revenue–China e-commerce and Alibaba Cloud — are performing quite poorly. Specifically, the revenue of its China-e-commerce business fell 1% year-over-year in Q4, while its cloud business generated a loss of 1.5 billion Chinese yuan, or $218 million.Conversely, the e-commerce revenue of one of Alibaba’s leading competitors in China, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), increased by 3.5% last quarter. And it’s a very bad sign for BABA that, well over a decade since it launched its cloud business, the unit is still bleeding tons of red ink.Meanwhile, in 2021 and 2022, BABA was a frequent target of China’s ruling Communist Party after the e-commerce giant’s founder, Jack Ma, harshly criticized the country’s financial system. Although there have been signs that Beijing is becoming less punitive towards the nation’s tech firms, some say that Chinese authorities may not be ready to become completely friendly towards the sector. That’s because the country has obtained “golden shares” in a number of prominent Chinese tech names, including a key BABA subsidiary.CNN explained that these shares “allow government officials to be directly involved in [tech firms’] businesses, including having a say in the content they provide to hundreds of millions of people.”Beijing’s decision to take “golden shares” in BABA’s subsidiary suggests that the government may, at a moment’s notice, resume taking punitive actions against BABA, causing the conglomerate’s shares to tumble.Coinbase (COIN)A Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.Source: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.comCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) says that it’s a prolific user of AI. “AI has been in the DNA of the company from the very beginning,” the crypto exchange’s director of data science, Soups Ranjan, told Amazon.According to Ranjan, COIN uses AI to prevent fraud. “One of the biggest risk factors that a cryptocurrency exchange must get right is fraud, and machine learning forms the linchpin of our anti-fraud system.” the executive explained.But, despite crypto’s recent rebound amid the problems suffered by several banks in March, most cryptos are still very far below their highs. And cryptos proved worthless as a hedge against inflation in 2021 and 2022, destroying one of crypto bulls’ main arguments. Given these points, I believe that most investors have lost confidence in cryptos.Supporting the latter contention, there were $80 billion of assets on COIN’s platform at the end of Q4, down from $278 billion at the end of 2021.Meanwhile, the federal government is quite obviously targeting crypto in general and COIN in particular. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission is demanding that crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, register as securities exchanges, but COIN has refused to do so.Additionally, the agency has taken steps to ban “crypto staking,” which has become a key source of revenue for Coinbase. Further, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Controller of the Currency have adamantly tried to prevent banks from funding “crypto-asset-related entities.”Very few people or organizations can fight Washington and emerge victorious.ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF (ARKQ)a worker with a tablet remotely operates a standalone robot armSource: ShutterstockOne of Cathie Wood’s ETFs, the ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKQ) reports that it “focuses on energy, automation and manufacturing, materials, artificial intelligence, and autonomous transportation.”Since I began following Wood in 2021, I’ve been very unimpressed with her stock picks. I think she tends to pick a rather high percentage of names with poor prospects, excessive, unwarranted valuations, and/or extremely tough competition. Among her picks of the last two years that had one or more of those characteristics have been Coinbase, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), Palantir, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC), Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ), and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON).Given the high number of very bad picks that Wood has made in the past, I recommend avoiding all of her ETFs.Moreover, I’m not enamored with ARKQ’s second and third-largest holdings as of March 20. The sales of the ETF’s second-largest holding, robotics maker UIPath (NYSE:PATH), rose just 6.5% year-over-year last quarter, while it generated a net loss of $27.7 million, but its trailing price-sales ratio is a very large eight.The sales of the fund’s third-largest holding, Kratos Defense &amp; Security (NASDAQ:KTOS), climbed a very good 17% year-over-year, but its operating income dropped to $4.6 million from $10.2 million. Additionally, if the Ukraine-Russia War ends this year, KTOS stock will likely take a big hit.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is utilizing AI to enhance the performance of its surgical robots.But ISRG, facing an array of small, private challengers for years since the Food and Drug Administration approved its first surgical robots in 2000, had no serious competition.But much more ominously, Intuitive Surgical is going head-to-head with one of the world’s largest medical-device makers, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). The latter company’s robotic-surgery tool, Hugo, was approved by the EU in October 2021, and MDT started trials of Hugo in the U.S. in Q3 of 2022.“We expect our surgical robotics business to become a meaningful growth driver for Medtronic,” the company’s CEO stated last month, adding that the revenue from Hugo is trending higher.Perhaps indicating that Intuitive Surgical is already beginning to be hurt by the competition, the company delivered 369 “surgical systems” last quarter, down from 385 during the same period a year earlier. The decline occurred despite the reduced, negative impact of the coronavirus previous quarter versus the same period a year earlier in America and Europe.ISRG stock has an elevated forward price-earnings ratio of 42x.Snowflake (SNOW)Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) has developed a “data platform” that enables companies to access all of their data from one location. According to SNOW, “Snowflake’s platform was designed from the ground up to support machine learning and AI-driven data science applications.”SNOW’s CEO, Frank Slootman, has a sterling resume. He was CEO of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) from 2011 to 2017 and helped build that company, which automates IT processes, into a formidable giant.But SNOW’s financial results and its 2023 guidance do not justify its current, gigantic valuation.On the positive side, the company’s product revenue jumped 54% year-over-year last quarter. However, its operating margin, excluding certain items, was just 6%.For all of last year, SNOW’s product revenue soared 70%. But for this year, the company expects the metric’s growth to slow radically to just 40%.Moreover, SNOW expects its operating margin for all of this year to remain a very anemic 6%.Together, this data suggests either that the company’s market is already starting to be saturated or it’s encountering growing competition, forcing it to charge relatively low prices and causing its growth to decelerate sharply.Turning to the huge valuation of SNOW stock, the shares are changing hands at a forward price-earnings ratio of 222, with a huge price-sales ratio of 15x.A company should have all-around great metrics and accelerating growth at that valuation. SNOW does not have either characteristic.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer was short COIN.

(NASDAQ:XRAY) Will Pay A US$0.14 Dividend In Four Days,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dentsply-sirona-inc-nasdaq-xray-135127473.html,1679752287,STORY,['XRAY'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (NASDAQ:XRAY) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase DENTSPLY SIRONA's shares before the 30th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.14 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.50 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, DENTSPLY SIRONA has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current stock price of $37.25. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. DENTSPLY SIRONA's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If DENTSPLY SIRONA didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. It distributed 28% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. DENTSPLY SIRONA was unprofitable last year, but at least the general trend suggests its earnings have been improving over the past five years. Even so, an unprofitable company whose business does not quickly recover is usually not a good candidate for dividend investors.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, DENTSPLY SIRONA has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.8% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of DENTSPLY SIRONA's financial health, by checking our visualisation of its financial health, here.To Sum It UpIs DENTSPLY SIRONA worth buying for its dividend? It's hard to get used to DENTSPLY SIRONA paying a dividend despite reporting a loss over the past year. At least the dividend was covered by free cash flow, however. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of DENTSPLY SIRONA's dividend merits.On that note, you'll want to research what risks DENTSPLY SIRONA is facing. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for DENTSPLY SIRONA that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

What exactly does that entail, though? For one thing, the underlying sector – especially the hydrocarbon arena – will command long-term relevance. While the ideological winds seek to replace fossil fuels, renewable sources often lack the energy density required to compete effectively.The other component that makes the below energy stocks exceptionally compelling is that they hit the sweet spot of being undervalued (by objective standards) but highly rated among Wall Street analysts. Further, it’s not just about the baseline assessment itself. Rather, each of the names below commands an average price target that implies double-digit reward potential.PBFPBF Energy$43.02MPCMarathon Petroleum$126.98VLOValero Energy$131.77MGYMagnolia Oil &amp; Gas$20.68DVNDevon Energy$47.76ARCHArch Resources$130.00EPMEvolution Petroleum$5.81InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPBF Energy (PBF)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, and lubricants (among many other products), PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) deserves special consideration as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. With social normalization trends likely to increase traffic volume on our roadways, PBF offers an opportunity to profit. Indeed, since the January opener, PBG gained over 12% of its equity value.Financially, the company isn’t perfect but it holds its own. For instance, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 5.08, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, PBF’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.61 times, favorably below the industry median of 1.67 times.Operationally, the refiner posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, ranked better than 79.48% of the oil and gas sector. Most importantly regarding this topic of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices PBF at a forward multiple of 4.94. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 71.07% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PBG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.44, implying over 22% upside potential.Story continuesMarathon Petroleum (MPC)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is one of the larger players in its field. At the moment, the company carries a market capitalization of nearly $56 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MPC returned shareholders almost 14%. In the past 365 days, it moved up 58%. Still, it technically ranks as one of the underrated energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot.Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.42. As a discount to earnings, Marathon Petroleum ranks better than 68.76% of sector rivals. In addition, MPC trades at 0.36 times sales. However, the sector median value, in this case, is 0.93 times.Notably, Marathon carries an Altman Z-Score of just under 4, indicating an enterprise safe from bankruptcy. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA pings at 1.12 times, below the sector median of 1.67 times. Moreover, Marathon’s a growth machine, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.1%. Lastly, covering analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $147.92, implying over 17% upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it covers other petrochemical products and power. Because of the ongoing social normalization trends, VLO easily represents one of the more relevant energy stocks. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained over 7% of equity value. In the past 365 days, they’re up nearly 37%.Even with the tremendous upside, VLO technically remains underrated. For instance, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.43. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than 68.61% of its peers. Also, VLO trades at a sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company beats out 80.23% of the industry.Further, Valero enjoys a robust balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.55. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, outpacing 76% of competitors. In closing, analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy (with one sell rating). Overall, the average price target comes out to $161.67, implying over 25% upside potential.Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (MGY)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (NYSE:MGY) is one of the underrated energy stocks for good reason. Since the beginning of this year, MGY fell over 7%. In the past 365 days, it gave up nearly 15% of its equity value. Still, the exploration and production (upstream) company could be an intriguing idea to consider, especially if you like to gamble.First, Magnolia enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio comes in at 1.73 times, outbidding 65.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.61, which ranks better than nearly 66% of the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.9%, while its net margin is nearly 53%. Both stats rank well into the industry’s upper half.Regarding valuation, the market prices MGY at a trailing multiple of 4.36. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) is 4.64 times, below the industry median of 7.3 times. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MGY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $29.67, implying nearly 45% upside potential.Devon Energy (DVN)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFocused on hydrocarbon exploration, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) commands a relevant profile among energy stocks. Unfortunately, DVN failed to resonate with investors so far this year. Since the Jan. opener, DVN gave up a worrying 19% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s off the mark by 23.5%. Nevertheless, for those that want to live a bit dangerously, DVN offers something to think about.Despite its market losses, Devon enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. Notably, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.65 times ranks better than 73.15% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 3.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.7% and a net margin of 31.38%. Both stats rank well in the upper half of the hydrocarbon sector.Most importantly for our discussion of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices DVN at a forward multiple of 5.75. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60.69% of its rivals. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DVN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target currently stands at $68.75, implying over 46% upside potential.Arch Resources (ARCH)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA coal mining and processing firm, Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the U.S. Per its public profile, Arch is the second-largest supplier of coal in the nation. Despite its relevancies, since the beginning of this year, ARCH slipped over 2%. In the trailing year, it’s down 13%.Nevertheless, for contrarian investors, ARCH may be one of the energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. Presently, the market prices ARCH at a trailing multiple of 2.04. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 83.67% of sector players. Also, its price-to-FCF comes in at 2.65 times. Here, the applicable discount for Arch ranks better than 69.47% of the industry.Beyond the valuation, Arch benefits from a solid balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.43. Also, the coal firm’s three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at 41%, above 74.15% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ARCH as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target pings at $201.33, implying nearly 54% upside potential.Evolution Petroleum (EPM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the U.S. As with some of the riskier energy stocks, EPM looks shaky at the moment. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20%.Still, for the contrarian investor, EPM could also rank among the underappreciated energy stocks to buy. Financially, Evolution benefits from excellent strengths in the balance sheet. In particular, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 17.84 times, above 77.23% of the industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 5.51 indicates a low risk of bankruptcy.Regarding the theme at hand, the market prices EPM at a trailing multiple of 4.51.

The Confectionery &amp; Snacks segment is the largest segment in the market with a volume of $1.64 trillion in 2023.The food industry is grappling with numerous challenges, including concerns about food safety, climate change, and the increasing demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly food production methods. Consumers are becoming more aware of the quality and source of their food, leading to a rise in demand for products that are organic, locally sourced, and non-genetically modified.Advances in technology, such as precision farming and food traceability systems, are helping to improve efficiency and productivity throughout the supply chain. There is also a growing trend towards plant-based and alternative protein sources, as consumers become more health-conscious and environmentally aware.The growing global population, expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, is one of the key drivers of the food industry. As the population increases, the demand for food products also rises, creating opportunities for companies in the food industry.We have picked the 25 most valuable food companies in the world based on the market capitalization.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So, when we ran our eye over McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on McDonald's is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$10b ÷ (US$50b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, McDonald's has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.8% earned by companies in a similar industry.

If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.Our Take On McDonald's' ROCEMcDonald's has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 95% to shareholders over the last five years.

Yet, despite the clouds in the distance, investors continue to debate whether it’s wiser to buy stocks that are poised for growth or ones brimming with value. As CNBC contributor Bob Pisani sees it, value and growth are often grouped together. He cites Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a classic example. Standard &amp; Poors calls it both. And the index publisher classifies ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) as purely a growth stock. XOM was a cash flow gusher the past two years, but it’s hardly what most people classify as growth. Heck, it sells a product that one day could be no more.In 2023, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA:IVE), which tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index, is up 0.3%. The iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IVW), which, you guessed it, tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index, is up nearly 5.3%. In other words, growth is back, baby. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, I’m looking for established stocks to buy that are poised for growth in 2023. To make my list, a stock must be held by IVW, founded in the 20th century, and expected to grow revenue and profits by 10% or more in the year ahead. NVDANvidia$264.68UNHUnitedHealth Group$475.52VVisa $220.04DEDeere &amp; Co.$394.97PGRProgressive$136.69INTUIntuit$414.21SBUXStarbucks$99.12Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes the cut. The stock is IVW’s third-largest holding, was founded in 1993, and is estimated to grow revenue and earnings per share by 10% and 34.4%, respectively, this year. I’ve been a big fan of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang. In September 2021, I called Huang America’s most influential CEO. The stock might be down from its late-2021 highs, but Huang continues to make the right moves for the company’s long-term growth.Story continuesHuang spoke about artificial intelligence (AI) at the company’s GTC 2023 conference this week. In addition, Nvidia issued several press releases regarding AI on March 21. “The warp drive engine is accelerated computing, and the energy source is AI,” Huang said in his keynote at the company’s GTC conference. “The impressive capabilities of generative AI have created a sense of urgency for companies to reimagine their products and business models.”Huang suggested that AI is this generation’s iPhone moment. I think he’s right.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is the IVW’s seventh-largest holding, was founded in 1977, and has revenue and EPS growth estimates of 11% and 12.4%, respectively, for this year. UnitedHealth rightfully calls itself a “health care and well-being company” because it does much more than provide health insurance for millions of people in the U.S. and elsewhere. In 2022, it generated revenue of $182.8 billion, 17.5% higher than a year earlier, with $14.1 billion in earnings from operations, also up 17.5% from a year earlier. The company’s Optum Insight reporting segment provides software and data analytics to health plans to help them navigate the complexities of the healthcare system. At the end of December, the division’s order backlog was $30 billion, of which $16.8 billion would be generated in 2023. Unsurprisingly, 22 out of 26 analysts covering the stock have an “overweight” or “buy” rating on it with an average target price of $597.96. That’s 26% above where it’s currently trading.  Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is the IVW’s 10th-largest holding. Its underpinnings began in 1958, although Visa Inc. wasn’t officially created until 2007. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 10.4% this year and EPS growth of 12.5%. In early March, the Ontario Teachers’ pension — one of Canada’s largest public service pension funds — filed its 2021 annual report. It’s a good idea for investors to examine these reports. They’re chock-full of interesting details. The pension fund revealed that it initiated a position in Visa, buying 2.2 million shares in the fourth quarter. That’s a sign that the fund likes where the financial services company is headed. And how could you not? V stock is up nearly 90% over the past five years, 33 percentage points higher than the S&amp;P 500. So in good times and bad, it’s a fintech to own. Deere &amp; Co. (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comDeere &amp; Co. (NYSE:DE) is the IVW’s 32nd-largest holding. It was founded in 1837 by John Deere, and this year’s revenue and EPS growth estimates are 13.5% and 31.1%, respectively. The company delivered fiscal Q1 2023 earnings in February that were off-the-charts good. Analysts expected sales of $11.28 billion and EPS of $5.57. Revenue came in at $11.4 billion, while earnings beat by 98 cents a share. Things are so good the company raised its earnings expectations for 2023 from $8.25 billion at the midpoint of its guidance in November to $9 billion. You don’t see too many names among IVW’s holdings upgrading their guidance like that. It’s a sign of more good things to come.“‘Solid start to fiscal year 2023,’ wrote Baird analyst Mig Dobre in a Friday report. This ‘is the year we’ve been waiting for as the supply chain is starting to allow for sizable production increases while the positive price/cost gap reaches a decade-plus high,’” Barron’s reported. Analysts generally like DE with 18 “overweight or “buy” ratings, eight “holds” and zero “sells.”Progressive (PGR)A white car with the Progressive logo written across the doors in big blue lettersSource: ShutterstockProgressive (NYSE:PGR) is IVW’s 42nd-largest holding. It was founded in 1937 in Cleveland, and its revenue and EPS growth estimates for this year stand at 17.7% and 44.8%, respectively. Morningstar senior analyst Brett Horn has a love-hate relationship with Progressive. On the one hand, he considers it an excellent company, possessing “one of the strongest franchises in the insurance industry.” On the other hand, he notes it’s an expensive stock “trading well above our $99 fair value.”With shares trading at nearly $137 currently, I can see why he’s hesitant. However, sometimes you have to pay more for quality. If you are a dividend investor, you should be interested in the company’s dividend policy. Progressive pays a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share for a forward annual yield of 0.3%. However, it also pays a variable dividend, which is at the board’s discretion. In 2022, it passed on paying out a variable dividend, opting to invest the funds in growth initiatives. In 2021, however, it paid out $5.90 in variable dividends, and it paid out $2.25 in 2020 and $2.41 in 2019.Between 2019 and 2022, the company paid out $12.26 in total dividends. That’s an average of $3.06 a year for an attractive 2.2% yield.  Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc.

It was founded in 1983, and its 2023 revenue and EPS growth estimates are 11.3% and 16.5%, respectively.Let’s face it; there are no bigger couple of words in business today than artificial intelligence. Bill Gates says so. And he’s a pretty smart dude. “The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the internet, and the mobile phone,” Gates stated on his blog. Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi is focused on getting his entire headcount AI-literate. The idea is that the whole company works to possess transferable skills across its many departments, including IT. By creating a culture of learning, Intuit will be fully equipped for the AI future.As Goodarzi stated in the company’s Q2 2023 conference call, the company has five big bets: “revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.”    You’ll notice that the first one is directly related to AI. That’s excellent news if you’re a long-time shareholder.Starbucks (SBUX)the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shopSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comI didn’t think I’d have to go to the 55th company in IVW to get my seventh selection. That tells you all you need to know about the growth prospects for S&amp;P 500 companies in 2023. They’re not good in the eyes of analysts. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) was founded in 1971, and its 2023 revenue and EPS growth estimates are 11.4% and 14.9%, respectively.The company moved up its plan to move Laxman Narasimhan into the CEO chair two weeks early, announcing on March 20 that Narasimhan was now in charge. Narasimhan was formerly CEO of Reckitt Benckiser Group (OTCMKTS:RBGLY) for over three years. Before that, he held executive positions with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and was a consultant with McKinsey. Starbucks was recently named the most-valuable restaurant brand in the U.S. for the seventh consecutive year. It constantly does an excellent job of reinventing itself. As a result of that hard work, it has a 10-year annualized total return of 14.5%, 244 basis points higher than McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).      On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But when investors choose wisely, they can be rewarded with a stock that turns into a compounding machine and grows money at a staggering rate. Consider that $1,000 invested in Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) 2004 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth $1.2 million today, and you can see the benefits of picking stocks of companies that are well-managed, have strong earnings, and are growth machines. While not every stock is going to be as successful as Alphabet and many picks may not pan out all, having a few winners can really help to supercharge a portfolio. And while the market remains rocky, there are still some strong stocks to buy for the long haul. Here are seven hot stocks to turn $1,000 into $10,000 by 2030.FSLRFirst Solar$208TSLATesla$192INTUIntuit$427NVDANvidia$271WBDWarner Bros.

FSLR stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAs its name implies, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is an American manufacturer of solar panels. And it is a leader in its industry. Consequently, the company and its stock are riding the wave that is building behind the transition to renewable energy in America.FSLR stock has gained 40% so far this year, has risen 165% over the last 12 months, and is up nearly 200% over the past five years. That kind of consistent growth and outperformance is certain to help turn $1,000 of FSLR’s shares into $10,000 by 2030.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFSLR stock recently got a boost after analysts at UBS lifted their rating on the security to “buy” from “neutral” and raised their price target on the shares to $250 from $140 previously. UBS analyst Jon Windham said First Solar is well-positioned to benefit from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits that cover 30% of the cost of installing solar panels.Story continuesThe company also impressed investors with its latest earnings that showed its net sales rose 10% year-over-year while its net loss declined 85%.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comElectric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another company that is helping with America’s energy transition. And while TSLA stock suffered a punishing decline last fall in the months immediately after CEO Elon Musk took control of Twitter, its share price is once again proving to be resilient. So far this year, Tesla’s share price is up 56% and it has managed to recover much of the ground that it lost between Halloween and Christmas last year.TSLA stock has been a great compounder for shareholders. In the past five years, the share price has increased 883%. Investors will be hard pressed to find other stocks with that kind of growth since 2018.While Tesla CEO Elon Musk remains a polarizing figure and Tesla’s stock continues to suffer through volatile periods, it continues to have an overwhelming, upward trajectory.The stock is also one of the most widely held tech securities, and the company continues to dominate the electric vehicle sector despite rising competition in the space.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIt’s tax season, and that should enable Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the software company behind the popular TurboTax tax preparation application, to deliver great financial results this quarter. The company also markets personal finance app Mint, small business accounting program QuickBooks, and credit monitoring service Credit Karma. Taken together, these products have proven to be extremely popular with both businesses and consumers. This helps to explain why INTU stock has risen 148% over the past five years.The company has continued to consistently report better-than-expected earnings. Most recently, the company announced that its long-time Chief Financial Officer, Michelle Clatterbuck, is retiring this July after a 20-year career at Intuit. She will be succeeded by Sandeep Singh Aujla, who has been at Intuit for seven years in several different financial roles.Aujla’s promotion will provide much-needed continuity to the company. While Intuit’s stock has pulled back 11% in the last 12 months with the broader tech sector, INTU stock has grown more than 600% in the ten years since 2013.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockIf you believe, as many people do, that artificial intelligence is the next frontier in tech,  than you should take a bullish position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company makes some of the most advanced microchips and semiconductors in the world, and  the most advanced supercomputers and AI applications, including ChatGPT, use its chips.At a developer conference held on March 21, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made it clear that the company is increasingly focused on AI and helping to bring the technology to the masses.Nvidia unveiled a new DGX Cloud service that promises to provide its enterprise customers with the supercomputing capabilities needed to develop and train their own generative AI models that will be similar to ChatGPT.The notion that Nvidia is a key player in the AI space has helped propel the company’s stock 92% higher so far in 2023. NVDA stock has more than doubled in the last six months alone.Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.Source: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.comThe streaming industry is growing, maturing and diversifying. And one of the companies best positioned to come out a long-term winner in the sector is Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD). The strength of Warner Bros. Discovery comes from its roster of assets and brands, which include DC Comics, Home Box Office (HBO), CNN, Turner Broadcasting, the Food Network and Cooking Channel, and the streaming platforms HBO Max and Discovery+.While Warner Bros. Discovery is still a relatively new company that was formed only last year after WarnerMedia was spun off by AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and then merged with the Discovery Network, investors are warming to the stock and its future growth prospects.After a bumpy reception last year, WBD stock has gained 50% in 2023. The stock has been moving higher in recent weeks following several upgrades by analysts, who cited the company’s strong position among streaming companies.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has a potentially huge catalyst for its stock looming on the horizon in the form of a medication that treats obesity. The weight-loss drug, called “Tirzepatide,” is in the final stages of approval with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some analysts are saying it could be the biggest blockbuster prescription drug ever.Eli Lilly is wasting no time in preparing for the obesity medication’s approval, expanding existing facilities so that it can manufacture and quickly get Tirzepatide to market.However, even if Tirzepatide runs into problems with the FDA, Eli Lilly still has a reliable stable of other blockbuster drugs that continue to drive its earnings and share price higher. These include antipsychotic medication Zyprexa, and diabetes treatment Trulicity.The sales of these medications have helped propel LLY stock 17% higher over the last 12 months and 343% higher in the past five years. Getting in on Eli Lilly’s stock before the weight loss drug comes to market could be a genius move.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.comConsumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not just a growth stock, but it is also a safe haven that investors turn to in times of uncertainty. After a few regional banks failed in the U.S., AAPL stock nonetheless gained more than 5%. The stock now accounts for 7% of the weighting of the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, more than any other U.S. stock, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. While Apple’s share price has largely traded sideways over the past six months due to choppy markets, it remains a juggernaut and long-term powerhouse.In the past five years, AAPL stock has gained nearly 300%. Over a decade, the share price is up 950%. And, Apple buys back more of its own stock than any other publicly traded company.Throw in several stock splits and a quarterly dividend payment of 23 cents a share and Apple’s stock is a compounding machine. As for its business, Apple continues to grow and diversify into new areas ranging from streaming to buy now, pay later.Plus, some analysts are still calling for an iPhone sales supercycle as people upgrade to 5G wireless technology.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GOOGL, NVDA, LLY and AAPL.

What exactly does that entail, though? For one thing, the underlying sector – especially the hydrocarbon arena – will command long-term relevance. While the ideological winds seek to replace fossil fuels, renewable sources often lack the energy density required to compete effectively.The other component that makes the below energy stocks exceptionally compelling is that they hit the sweet spot of being undervalued (by objective standards) but highly rated among Wall Street analysts. Further, it’s not just about the baseline assessment itself. Rather, each of the names below commands an average price target that implies double-digit reward potential.PBFPBF Energy$43.02MPCMarathon Petroleum$126.98VLOValero Energy$131.77MGYMagnolia Oil &amp; Gas$20.68DVNDevon Energy$47.76ARCHArch Resources$130.00EPMEvolution Petroleum$5.81InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPBF Energy (PBF)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, and lubricants (among many other products), PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) deserves special consideration as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. With social normalization trends likely to increase traffic volume on our roadways, PBF offers an opportunity to profit. Indeed, since the January opener, PBG gained over 12% of its equity value.Financially, the company isn’t perfect but it holds its own. For instance, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 5.08, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, PBF’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.61 times, favorably below the industry median of 1.67 times.Operationally, the refiner posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, ranked better than 79.48% of the oil and gas sector. Most importantly regarding this topic of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices PBF at a forward multiple of 4.94. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 71.07% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PBG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.44, implying over 22% upside potential.Story continuesMarathon Petroleum (MPC)Man holding stacks of money.

At the moment, the company carries a market capitalization of nearly $56 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MPC returned shareholders almost 14%. In the past 365 days, it moved up 58%. Still, it technically ranks as one of the underrated energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot.Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.42. As a discount to earnings, Marathon Petroleum ranks better than 68.76% of sector rivals. In addition, MPC trades at 0.36 times sales. However, the sector median value, in this case, is 0.93 times.Notably, Marathon carries an Altman Z-Score of just under 4, indicating an enterprise safe from bankruptcy. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA pings at 1.12 times, below the sector median of 1.67 times. Moreover, Marathon’s a growth machine, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.1%. Lastly, covering analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy.

As well, it covers other petrochemical products and power. Because of the ongoing social normalization trends, VLO easily represents one of the more relevant energy stocks. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained over 7% of equity value. In the past 365 days, they’re up nearly 37%.Even with the tremendous upside, VLO technically remains underrated. For instance, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.43. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than 68.61% of its peers. Also, VLO trades at a sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company beats out 80.23% of the industry.Further, Valero enjoys a robust balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.55. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, outpacing 76% of competitors. In closing, analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy (with one sell rating). Overall, the average price target comes out to $161.67, implying over 25% upside potential.Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (MGY)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

Since the beginning of this year, MGY fell over 7%. In the past 365 days, it gave up nearly 15% of its equity value. Still, the exploration and production (upstream) company could be an intriguing idea to consider, especially if you like to gamble.First, Magnolia enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio comes in at 1.73 times, outbidding 65.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.61, which ranks better than nearly 66% of the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.9%, while its net margin is nearly 53%. Both stats rank well into the industry’s upper half.Regarding valuation, the market prices MGY at a trailing multiple of 4.36. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) is 4.64 times, below the industry median of 7.3 times. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MGY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $29.67, implying nearly 45% upside potential.Devon Energy (DVN)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFocused on hydrocarbon exploration, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) commands a relevant profile among energy stocks. Unfortunately, DVN failed to resonate with investors so far this year. Since the Jan. opener, DVN gave up a worrying 19% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s off the mark by 23.5%. Nevertheless, for those that want to live a bit dangerously, DVN offers something to think about.Despite its market losses, Devon enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. Notably, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.65 times ranks better than 73.15% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 3.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.7% and a net margin of 31.38%. Both stats rank well in the upper half of the hydrocarbon sector.Most importantly for our discussion of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices DVN at a forward multiple of 5.75. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60.69% of its rivals. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DVN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target currently stands at $68.75, implying over 46% upside potential.Arch Resources (ARCH)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA coal mining and processing firm, Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the U.S. Per its public profile, Arch is the second-largest supplier of coal in the nation. Despite its relevancies, since the beginning of this year, ARCH slipped over 2%. In the trailing year, it’s down 13%.Nevertheless, for contrarian investors, ARCH may be one of the energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. Presently, the market prices ARCH at a trailing multiple of 2.04. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 83.67% of sector players. Also, its price-to-FCF comes in at 2.65 times. Here, the applicable discount for Arch ranks better than 69.47% of the industry.Beyond the valuation, Arch benefits from a solid balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.43. Also, the coal firm’s three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at 41%, above 74.15% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ARCH as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target pings at $201.33, implying nearly 54% upside potential.Evolution Petroleum (EPM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the U.S. As with some of the riskier energy stocks, EPM looks shaky at the moment. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20%.Still, for the contrarian investor, EPM could also rank among the underappreciated energy stocks to buy. Financially, Evolution benefits from excellent strengths in the balance sheet. In particular, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 17.84 times, above 77.23% of the industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 5.51 indicates a low risk of bankruptcy.Regarding the theme at hand, the market prices EPM at a trailing multiple of 4.51. As a discount to earnings, Evolution ranks better than 68.46% of its rivals. Also, it trades at 2.82 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median value is 4.41. Lastly, Northland Securities’ Donovan Schafer, CFA, pegs EPM as a buy. Further, the expert anticipates shares hitting $11, implying nearly 97% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Yet, despite the clouds in the distance, investors continue to debate whether it’s wiser to buy stocks that are poised for growth or ones brimming with value. As CNBC contributor Bob Pisani sees it, value and growth are often grouped together. He cites Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a classic example. Standard &amp; Poors calls it both. And the index publisher classifies ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) as purely a growth stock. XOM was a cash flow gusher the past two years, but it’s hardly what most people classify as growth. Heck, it sells a product that one day could be no more.In 2023, the iShares S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA:IVE), which tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index, is up 0.3%. The iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IVW), which, you guessed it, tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index, is up nearly 5.3%. In other words, growth is back, baby. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, I’m looking for established stocks to buy that are poised for growth in 2023. To make my list, a stock must be held by IVW, founded in the 20th century, and expected to grow revenue and profits by 10% or more in the year ahead. NVDANvidia$264.68UNHUnitedHealth Group$475.52VVisa $220.04DEDeere &amp; Co.$394.97PGRProgressive$136.69INTUIntuit$414.21SBUXStarbucks$99.12Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes the cut. The stock is IVW’s third-largest holding, was founded in 1993, and is estimated to grow revenue and earnings per share by 10% and 34.4%, respectively, this year. I’ve been a big fan of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang. In September 2021, I called Huang America’s most influential CEO. The stock might be down from its late-2021 highs, but Huang continues to make the right moves for the company’s long-term growth.Story continuesHuang spoke about artificial intelligence (AI) at the company’s GTC 2023 conference this week. In addition, Nvidia issued several press releases regarding AI on March 21. “The warp drive engine is accelerated computing, and the energy source is AI,” Huang said in his keynote at the company’s GTC conference. “The impressive capabilities of generative AI have created a sense of urgency for companies to reimagine their products and business models.”Huang suggested that AI is this generation’s iPhone moment. I think he’s right.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is the IVW’s seventh-largest holding, was founded in 1977, and has revenue and EPS growth estimates of 11% and 12.4%, respectively, for this year. UnitedHealth rightfully calls itself a “health care and well-being company” because it does much more than provide health insurance for millions of people in the U.S. and elsewhere. In 2022, it generated revenue of $182.8 billion, 17.5% higher than a year earlier, with $14.1 billion in earnings from operations, also up 17.5% from a year earlier. The company’s Optum Insight reporting segment provides software and data analytics to health plans to help them navigate the complexities of the healthcare system. At the end of December, the division’s order backlog was $30 billion, of which $16.8 billion would be generated in 2023. Unsurprisingly, 22 out of 26 analysts covering the stock have an “overweight” or “buy” rating on it with an average target price of $597.96. That’s 26% above where it’s currently trading.  Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is the IVW’s 10th-largest holding. Its underpinnings began in 1958, although Visa Inc. wasn’t officially created until 2007. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 10.4% this year and EPS growth of 12.5%. In early March, the Ontario Teachers’ pension — one of Canada’s largest public service pension funds — filed its 2021 annual report. It’s a good idea for investors to examine these reports. They’re chock-full of interesting details. The pension fund revealed that it initiated a position in Visa, buying 2.2 million shares in the fourth quarter. That’s a sign that the fund likes where the financial services company is headed. And how could you not? V stock is up nearly 90% over the past five years, 33 percentage points higher than the S&amp;P 500. So in good times and bad, it’s a fintech to own. Deere &amp; Co. (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comDeere &amp; Co. (NYSE:DE) is the IVW’s 32nd-largest holding. It was founded in 1837 by John Deere, and this year’s revenue and EPS growth estimates are 13.5% and 31.1%, respectively. The company delivered fiscal Q1 2023 earnings in February that were off-the-charts good. Analysts expected sales of $11.28 billion and EPS of $5.57. Revenue came in at $11.4 billion, while earnings beat by 98 cents a share. Things are so good the company raised its earnings expectations for 2023 from $8.25 billion at the midpoint of its guidance in November to $9 billion. You don’t see too many names among IVW’s holdings upgrading their guidance like that. It’s a sign of more good things to come.“‘Solid start to fiscal year 2023,’ wrote Baird analyst Mig Dobre in a Friday report. This ‘is the year we’ve been waiting for as the supply chain is starting to allow for sizable production increases while the positive price/cost gap reaches a decade-plus high,’” Barron’s reported. Analysts generally like DE with 18 “overweight or “buy” ratings, eight “holds” and zero “sells.”Progressive (PGR)A white car with the Progressive logo written across the doors in big blue lettersSource: ShutterstockProgressive (NYSE:PGR) is IVW’s 42nd-largest holding. It was founded in 1937 in Cleveland, and its revenue and EPS growth estimates for this year stand at 17.7% and 44.8%, respectively. Morningstar senior analyst Brett Horn has a love-hate relationship with Progressive. On the one hand, he considers it an excellent company, possessing “one of the strongest franchises in the insurance industry.” On the other hand, he notes it’s an expensive stock “trading well above our $99 fair value.”With shares trading at nearly $137 currently, I can see why he’s hesitant. However, sometimes you have to pay more for quality. If you are a dividend investor, you should be interested in the company’s dividend policy. Progressive pays a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share for a forward annual yield of 0.3%. However, it also pays a variable dividend, which is at the board’s discretion. In 2022, it passed on paying out a variable dividend, opting to invest the funds in growth initiatives. In 2021, however, it paid out $5.90 in variable dividends, and it paid out $2.25 in 2020 and $2.41 in 2019.Between 2019 and 2022, the company paid out $12.26 in total dividends. That’s an average of $3.06 a year for an attractive 2.2% yield.  Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc.

It was founded in 1983, and its 2023 revenue and EPS growth estimates are 11.3% and 16.5%, respectively.Let’s face it; there are no bigger couple of words in business today than artificial intelligence. Bill Gates says so. And he’s a pretty smart dude. “The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the internet, and the mobile phone,” Gates stated on his blog. Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi is focused on getting his entire headcount AI-literate. The idea is that the whole company works to possess transferable skills across its many departments, including IT. By creating a culture of learning, Intuit will be fully equipped for the AI future.As Goodarzi stated in the company’s Q2 2023 conference call, the company has five big bets: “revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.”    You’ll notice that the first one is directly related to AI. That’s excellent news if you’re a long-time shareholder.Starbucks (SBUX)the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shopSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comI didn’t think I’d have to go to the 55th company in IVW to get my seventh selection. That tells you all you need to know about the growth prospects for S&amp;P 500 companies in 2023. They’re not good in the eyes of analysts. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) was founded in 1971, and its 2023 revenue and EPS growth estimates are 11.4% and 14.9%, respectively.The company moved up its plan to move Laxman Narasimhan into the CEO chair two weeks early, announcing on March 20 that Narasimhan was now in charge. Narasimhan was formerly CEO of Reckitt Benckiser Group (OTCMKTS:RBGLY) for over three years. Before that, he held executive positions with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and was a consultant with McKinsey. Starbucks was recently named the most-valuable restaurant brand in the U.S. for the seventh consecutive year. It constantly does an excellent job of reinventing itself. As a result of that hard work, it has a 10-year annualized total return of 14.5%, 244 basis points higher than McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).      On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sherwin-Williams. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sherwin-Williams?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Sherwin-Williams already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sherwin-Williams, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sherwin-Williams. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.0% and 6.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Sherwin-Williams Company 401(K) Plan and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Sherwin-WilliamsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Sherwin-Williams Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$168m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Sherwin-Williams. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Sherwin-Williams (1 is a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:AMP) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 5.8% losses, last week’s 3.6% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Ameriprise Financial. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ameriprise Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Ameriprise Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ameriprise Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Ameriprise Financial. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 13%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 4.6% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$122m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Ameriprise Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.
